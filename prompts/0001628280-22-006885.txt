Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a surgical robotics company focused on advancing patient care by developing transformative solutions in urology. We develop, manufacture and sell the AquaBeam Robotic System, an advanced, image-guided, surgical robotic system for use in minimally invasive urologic surgery, with an initial focus on treating benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. BPH is the most common prostate disease and impacts approximately 40 million men in the United States. The AquaBeam Robotic System employs a single-use disposable handpiece to deliver our proprietary Aquablation therapy, which combines real-time, multi-dimensional imaging, personalized treatment planning, automated robotics and heat-free waterjet ablation for targeted and rapid removal of prostate tissue. We designed our AquaBeam Robotic System to enable consistent and reproducible BPH surgery outcomes. We believe that Aquablation therapy represents a paradigm shift in the surgical treatment of BPH by addressing compromises associated with alternative surgical interventions. We designed Aquablation therapy to deliver effective, safe and durable outcomes for males suffering from lower urinary tract symptoms, or LUTS, due to BPH that are independent of prostate size and shape or surgeon experience. We have developed a significant and growing body of clinical evidence, which includes nine clinical studies and over 100 peer-reviewed publications, supporting the benefits and clinical advantages of Aquablation therapy. As of December 31, 2021, we had an install base of 130 AquaBeam Robotic Systems globally, including 78 in the United States.
BPH refers to the non-malignant enlargement of the prostate gland, a small gland in the male reproductive system. The main role of the prostate is to produce the fluid that protects and gives nutrients to sperm. The prostate sits underneath the bladder and surrounds the top part of the urethra, which carries urine from the bladder.
 As the prostate enlarges, the gland presses against the urethra, which may obstruct or restrict the flow of urine from the bladder and result in uncomfortable LUTS, such as urgency, frequency, urinary retention, straining to urinate and a weak urinary stream. Without treatment, prolonged obstruction may eventually lead to acute urinary retention, urinary tract infections or renal insufficiency. 
In the United States it is estimated that approximately 40 million men are impacted by BPH, with aging demographics expected to drive future growth. Over the next ten years, it is expected that the number of men over 65 years old in the United States will double and include a corresponding increase in the number of men with enlarged prostates. Of these men, approximately 12 million are being managed by a physician for symptoms related to their disease. Our total addressable patient population in the United States includes approximately 8.2 million patients, comprising 6.7 million receiving drug therapy, 1.1 million who have tried but failed drug therapy and 400,000 undergoing surgical intervention each year. Based on the average selling price of our single-use handpiece, we estimate that our total addressable market opportunity is in excess of $20 billion in the United States. The global incidence of BPH among men over 50 years old is similar to that of the United States, representing a significant incremental market opportunity outside of the United States. 
The main goal of BPH treatment is to alleviate the symptoms associated with the disease and improve the patient’s quality of life. While drug therapy is typically a first line treatment option, limited efficacy and negative side effects contribute to low compliance and high failure rates and drop outs. On the other hand, surgical intervention is proven to provide effective and durable symptom relief compared to drug therapy, but the use of surgery is significantly underpenetrated, largely due to the compromise patients must make between the incidence of irreversible side effects associated with alternative resective surgical interventions, where obstructive tissue is removed at the time of intervention, or the lower rates of efficacy and durability associated with non-resective surgical interventions, where obstructive tissue is not removed, but rather the prostatic urethra is re-shaped. In addition, most alternative surgical interventions are limited by prostate size and shape, with no single procedure capable of effectively addressing the full range of prostate anatomies regardless of surgeon experience level.
We began developing our proprietary AquaBeam Robotic System in 2009 to address many of the shortcomings of alternative surgical interventions by delivering our Aquablation therapy, the first and only image-guided robotic therapy for the treatment of BPH. The AquaBeam Robotic System combines real-time image guidance, personalized treatment planning, automated robotic execution and heat-free waterjet ablation. We believe our Aquablation therapy addresses the compromise between safety and efficacy of alternative surgical interventions, providing the following unique combination of benefits: 
•Significant and durable symptom relief. Given obstructive prostate tissue is removed during the procedure, Aquablation therapy has demonstrated significant and long-lasting levels of symptom relief similar to those of 
alternative resective procedures. In our U.S. pivotal trial, Waterjet Ablation Therapy for Endoscopic Resection of prostate tissue, or the WATER study, Aquablation therapy demonstrated superior safety and non-inferior efficacy results compared to transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP, the historical standard of care for the surgical treatment of BPH. In the WATER and WATER II studies, surgical retreatment rates were only 5.2% at five years and 3.0% at four years, respectively. In the OPEN WATER study, there were no surgical retreatments at one year. The retreatment rates in the WATER and WATER II studies compare favorably to surgical retreatment rates observed for alternative treatments for BPH. One study published in the BJU International Journal reported on 52,748 men undergoing TURP or PVP with an approximated three-year freedom from surgical retreatment of 92% and 89%, respectively. A second study published in the Journal of Urology reported on 43,041 men undergoing TURP, PVP, enucleation, or open simple prostatectomy with an approximated three-year freedom from surgical retreatment of 93%, 89%, 94%, and 96%, respectively.
•Favorable safety profile. Aquablation therapy has demonstrated low rates of irreversible complications, including urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory dysfunction, compared to published rates observed for other resective surgeries. In our WATER study, patients who underwent Aquablation therapy maintained a higher level of sexual function compared to those who underwent TURP.
•Outcomes independent of prostate size and shape and surgeon experience. We designed Aquablation therapy to deliver outcomes that are effective, safe and durable for males suffering from LUTS due to BPH across all prostate sizes and shapes. Our WATER, WATER II and OPEN WATER studies enrolled men with prostate sizes between 20 ml and 150 ml; however, in the commercial setting, we have successfully treated men with prostate sizes over 300 ml. Additionally, in the WATER and WATER II studies, 50% and 83% of men, respectively, had an obstructive median lobe, and the average prostate size in each study was 54 ml and 107 ml, respectively. Compared to other resective procedures, we believe Aquablation therapy is relatively simple to learn, enabled by the intuitive user interface of the conformal planning unit, or CPU, and automated robotic resection, and delivers outcomes that are independent of surgeon experience.
•Personalized treatment planning and improved decision-making. Aquablation therapy combines cystoscopic visualization, which uses a camera attached to a hollow tube, along with ultrasound imaging and advanced planning software to provide the surgeon with a multidimensional view of the treatment area and enable personalized treatment planning for the patient’s unique anatomy, improved decision-making and real-time monitoring during the procedure.
•Targeted and controlled resection with consistent resection times. Aquablation therapy utilizes automated robotic resection to remove prostate tissue using a precise, heat-free waterjet. These features enable targeted and controlled tissue removal with rapid resection times that are highly consistent across prostate sizes and shapes and surgeon experience. 
We have developed a significant and growing body of clinical data that demonstrate the efficacy, safety and durability of Aquablation therapy, independent of prostate size and shape and surgeon experience. Our robust body of clinical evidence includes nine clinical studies and more than 100 peer-reviewed publications. Our WATER study is the only FDA pivotal study randomized against TURP. In this study, Aquablation therapy demonstrated superior safety and non-inferior efficacy compared to TURP across prostate sizes between 30 ml and 80 ml, and superior efficacy in a subset of patients with prostates larger than 50 ml. We have established strong relationships with KOLs within the urology community and collaborated with key urological societies in global markets. This support has been instrumental in facilitating broader acceptance and adoption of Aquablation therapy. We believe that as a result of our strong KOL network and our compelling clinical evidence, Aquablation therapy has been added to clinical guidelines of various professional associations, including the American Urological Association, or AUA. 
In the United States, we sell our products to hospitals. These customers in turn bill various third-party payors, such as commercial payors and government agencies, for reimbursement for the procedures using our products. Effective in 2021, all local Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs, which represent 100% of eligible Medicare patients, issued final positive local coverage determinations to provide Medicare beneficiaries with access to Aquablation therapy in all 50 states so long as such beneficiaries meet certain clinical criteria set forth in the local coverage determination. We believe that our strong body of clinical evidence and support from key societies, supplemented by the momentum from Medicare coverage, have led to favorable coverage decisions from several large commercial payors, including Anthem, Cigna, Humana, Health Care Service Corporation, BlueCross – Massachusetts, Emblem Health, and CareFirst. We plan to leverage these recent successes in our active discussions with commercial payors to establish additional positive national and regional coverage policies, although we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in doing so. Outside of the United States, 
we have ongoing efforts in key markets to expand established coverage and improve payment which we believe will expand patient access to Aquablation therapy.
We primarily sell our products through our direct sales organization in the United States, which targets urologists across the United States, who we believe represent the primary physician specialty managing the care of patients with BPH. We are initially targeting 860 high-volume hospitals that perform, on average, more than 200 resective procedures annually and account for approximately 70% of all hospital-based resective procedures. We estimate that approximately 50% of BPH patients who are on drug therapy as well as 50% who have failed drug therapy are under the care of a urologist, equating to approximately 3.9 million men. We believe we can reach these patients by continuing to educate our network of urologists of the clinical benefits of Aquablation therapy, provide comprehensive training programs and deepen our relationships with key urologists and various medical societies. Outside the United States, we sell our products using both our direct sales organization and, in certain regions, our network of distribution partners. 
We generated revenue of $34.5 million and $7.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and incurred a net loss of $59.9 million and $53.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $261.5 million.
Our Success Factors
We believe the continued growth of our company will be driven by the following success factors:
•First and only image-guided, heat-free robotic therapy for BPH that addresses the compromise between safety and efficacy of alternative surgical interventions. We have developed the AquaBeam Robotic System, an advanced, image-guided, surgical robotic system for use in minimally invasive BPH surgery. The AquaBeam Robotic System delivers our Aquablation therapy, the first and only image-guided, heat-free robotic therapy for the treatment of BPH. Aquablation therapy combines real-time, multidimensional imaging, personalized treatment planning, automated robotics and heat-free waterjet ablation for targeted and rapid removal of prostate tissue. We believe that alternative surgical interventions for BPH have a number of shortcomings which require patients to compromise between safety and efficacy, either providing significant symptom relief but with a heightened risk of irreversible complications or a lower risk of complications but with significantly less symptom relief. We believe Aquablation therapy represents a paradigm shift in the surgical treatment of BPH by addressing this compromise.
•Large, growing and underpenetrated market opportunity. BPH is the number one reason men visit a urologist and we estimate that approximately 40 million men in the United States alone are impacted by BPH, with aging demographics expected to drive future growth. Of these men, approximately 12 million are being managed by a physician for symptoms related to their disease. While drug therapy is typically a first-line treatment option, limited efficacy and negative side effects, including neurologic, ophthalmic and sexual complications, contribute to low compliance and high failure rates, often as high as 30%. On the other hand, surgical intervention is proven to provide effective and durable symptom relief compared to drug therapy, but the use of surgery is significantly underpenetrated, largely due to the compromise and limitations associated with alternative surgical interventions. Our total addressable patient population in the United States includes approximately 8.2 million patients, comprised of 6.7 million who are receiving drug therapy, 1.1 million who have tried but failed drug therapy and 400,000 who are undergoing surgical intervention each year. Based on the average selling price of our single-use handpiece, we estimate that our total U.S. addressable market opportunity is in excess of $20 billion. The global incidence of BPH among men over 50 years old is similar to that of the United States, representing a significant incremental market opportunity outside of the United States. 
•Significant and growing body of clinical evidence and strong support from key opinion leaders, or KOLs, resulting in the inclusion of Aquablation therapy into societal guidelines and rapid expansion of positive reimbursement coverage policies. We have developed a significant and growing body of clinical data that demonstrates the efficacy, safety and durability of Aquablation therapy, consistent across all prostate sizes and shapes and independent of surgeon experience. Our robust clinical evidence includes nine clinical studies that we sponsored and enrolled between 2013 and 2018, as well as more than 100 peer-reviewed publications. Our employees participated in protocol design, data management, monitoring, and statistical analysis in all nine clinical studies and results were provided to authors for publication upon request. Our WATER study is the only FDA pivotal study randomized against TURP, which is the historical standard of care for the surgical treatment of BPH. In this study, Aquablation therapy demonstrated superior safety and non-inferior efficacy results compared to TURP across prostate sizes between 30 ml and 80 ml, and superior efficacy results in a subset of patients with prostates larger than 50 ml. We have established strong relationships with KOLs within the urology community and collaborated with key urological societies in global markets. This support has been instrumental in facilitating 
broader acceptance and adoption of Aquablation therapy. As a result of our strong KOL network and our compelling clinical evidence, Aquablation therapy has been added to clinical guidelines of various professional associations, including the American Urological Association, European Association of Urology, Canadian Urological Association, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; has achieved favorable coverage determinations from MACs; and has been designated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, as demonstrating substantial clinical improvement over alternative surgical interventions and granted transitional pass-through payment status, effective January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022. We believe our compelling clinical evidence, strong KOL relationships and engagement with global urological societies will continue to play an important role in growing awareness and increasing adoption of Aquablation therapy.
•Compelling value proposition and benefits to hospitals, surgeons and patients. We designed our AquaBeam Robotic System to enable consistent and reproducible BPH surgery outcomes that are independent of surgeon experience and require minimal training. In addition, we believe the differentiated features of Aquablation therapy allow for improved predictability of outcomes and, as such, increase surgeon confidence in recommending surgical intervention to their patients. Given its ability to treat prostate sizes of all shapes and sizes, Aquablation therapy enables hospitals to consolidate the surgical treatment of BPH in a single therapy. We also believe that hospital administrators will be able to leverage the differentiation of Aquablation therapy as a marketing tool to attract skilled surgeons and patients to their hospital system. Furthermore, the AquaBeam Robotic System is highly mobile and compact, requiring no retrofitting of the operating room, and we believe is competitively priced compared to other robotic systems and capital equipment devices, both factors which we believe remove adoption hurdles for hospital customers and allow for a more streamlined hospital sales cycle. For patients, Aquablation therapy offers significant and durable symptom relief with an attractive safety profile. We believe these benefits will continue to support the adoption of Aquablation therapy by hospitals and surgeons.
•Recurring revenue model. We generate revenue primarily from hospitals making capital purchases of our AquaBeam Robotic System and purchasing our single-use handpieces for individual patient use. We also generate revenue by providing post-warranty service for the AquaBeam Robotic System. We believe our business model of selling capital equipment that generates corresponding disposables utilization and post-warranty service contracts provides a path to predictable, recurring revenue. 
•Broad research and development capabilities and a robust intellectual property portfolio. We have invested in establishing strong research and development capabilities for over a decade, including in surgical robotics and imaging-enabled surgery as well as integrating hardware and software to create an exceptional user and patient experience. We believe our focus on this experience will allow us to continue to bring new upgrades, capabilities and products to market, allowing us to innovate and maintain our competitive positioning. We have a broad patent portfolio, including 112 issued patents and 91 pending patent applications as of December 31, 2021. We believe our intellectual property and know-how present a significant barrier to entry for our competitors.
•Proven leadership team and board members with deep industry experience. We are led by a highly experienced management team and board with a successful track record of building businesses by identifying and providing solutions for underserved markets in the medical device industry. Our team has successfully led and managed dynamic growth phases in organizations and commercialized products in markets with established incumbents by addressing the unmet needs of the physicians and patients they serve. Our senior management team has an average of over 18 years of experience in the medical device industry across both public and private companies.
Our Growth Strategies
Our mission is to establish Aquablation therapy as the surgical standard of care for BPH. The key elements of our growth strategy are:
•Grow our installed base of AquaBeam Robotic Systems by driving adoption of Aquablation therapy among urologists. In the United States, we are initially focused on driving adoption of Aquablation therapy among urologists that perform hospital-based resective BPH surgery. We estimate that approximately 290,000 of the 400,000 annual BPH surgeries are resective procedures performed across approximately 2,700 hospitals. We are initially targeting 860 high-volume hospitals that we estimate perform, on average, more than 200 resective procedures annually and account for approximately 70% of all hospital-based resective procedures. To penetrate these hospitals, we will continue to increase our direct team of capital sales representatives, who are focused on driving system placement within hospitals by engaging with key surgeons and decision makers to educate them about the compelling value proposition of Aquablation therapy. We also intend to increase awareness of Aquablation therapy by continuing to publish clinical data in various industry and scientific journals, present our 
clinical data at various industry conferences and sponsor peer-to-peer education programs and proctorships. Over time, we will gradually expand our focus to also include mid- and low-volume hospitals. 
•Increase system utilization by establishing Aquablation therapy as the surgical treatment of choice for BPH. Once we place a system within a hospital, our objective is to establish Aquablation therapy as the surgical treatment of choice for BPH. Within each hospital, we are initially focused on targeting urologists who perform medium-to-high volumes of resective procedures and converting their resective cases to Aquablation therapy. To accomplish this, we will continue expanding our team of highly trained Aquablation representatives and clinical specialists, who are focused on driving system utilization within the hospital, providing education and training support and ensuring excellent user experiences. As urologists gain experience with Aquablation therapy, we will leverage their experiences to capture more surgical volumes and establish Aquablation therapy as the surgical standard of care. Over time, we intend to leverage our relationships with urologists to drive utilization of Aquablation therapy beyond the current surgical market. We estimate that approximately 50% of BPH patients who are on drug therapy as well as 50% who have failed drug therapy are under the care of a urologist, equating to approximately 3.9 million men. We believe we can reach these patients by continuing to educate our network of urologists of the clinical benefits of Aquablation therapy, provide comprehensive training programs and deepen our relationships with key urologists and various medical societies. Furthermore, we believe that additional coverage by private payors will continue to drive increased utilization.
•Continue to broaden private payor coverage. Since the addition of Aquablation therapy to AUA clinical guidelines in May 2019, we have significantly grown coverage for Aquablation therapy in the United States. Effective in 2021, all local MACs, which represent 100% of eligible Medicare patients, issued final positive local coverage determinations to provide Medicare beneficiaries with access to Aquablation therapy in all 50 states so long as such beneficiaries meet certain clinical criteria set forth in the local coverage determinations. We believe that these favorable coverage decisions have been a catalyst for hospital adoption of our AquaBeam Robotic System. Our strong body of clinical evidence and support from key societies, supplemented by the momentum from Medicare coverage, have led to favorable coverage decisions from several large private payors, including Anthem, Cigna, Humana, Health Care Service Corporation, BlueCross – Massachusetts, Emblem Health, and CareFirst. We plan to leverage these recent successes in our active discussions with private payors to establish additional positive national and regional coverage policies. We believe that additional private payor coverage will contribute to increasing utilization of our system over time. Outside of the United States, we have ongoing efforts in key markets to expand established coverage and further improve patient access to Aquablation therapy.
•Build upon our strong base of clinical evidence. We are committed to continuing to build upon our foundation of clinical evidence, which we believe will help drive increased awareness and adoption of our products. For example, we are continuing to follow patients in our WATER and WATER II studies to collect five-year clinical outcomes as well as conducting sub-group analyses across our base of clinical data that we believe will further define the role of Aquablation therapy across patient populations. We also plan to further build our base of clinical evidence by supporting new clinical studies intended to support commercial, regulatory and reimbursement efforts. For example, we are supporting an investigator-initiated clinical study, called WATER III, which will be a randomized controlled trial evaluating Aquablation therapy against laser enucleation in treating BPH patients with large prostate sizes.
•Invest in research and development to drive continuous improvements and innovation. We are currently developing additional and next generation technologies to support and improve Aquablation therapy to further satisfy the evolving needs of surgeons and their patients as well as to further enhance the usability and scalability of the AquaBeam Robotic System. We also plan to leverage our treatment data and software development capabilities to integrate artificial intelligence and machine-learning to enable computer-assisted anatomy recognition and improved treatment planning and personalization. In the future, we may evaluate the application of the AquaBeam Robotic System in new urologic conditions beyond BPH.
•Drive increased awareness of Aquablation therapy beyond the urology community. As we expand our network of urologists and grow our installed base, we intend to increase awareness and brand recognition of Aquablation therapy beyond urologists, primarily among primary care physicians who manage BPH patients. We estimate that approximately 3.9 million men, including approximately 3.3 million patients who are on drug therapy and 600,000 who have failed drug therapy, are under the care of a primary care physician. To achieve this objective, we will invest in marketing initiatives directed at primary care physicians in order to expand networks for BPH patients to visit a urologist. Once we have established a broader installed base of systems, we may seek to further increase patient awareness through various direct-to-patient marketing initiatives.
•Further penetrate and expand into existing and new international markets. We plan to establish and strengthen our presence internationally. While the United States remains our primary focus in the near-term, we are growing our existing presence in the large European markets, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, by continuing to promote the clinical benefits of Aquablation therapy, supporting investments in clinical studies to improve coverage and reimbursement and fostering relationships with KOLs. In addition, we intend to expand our reach to selected new markets in the Asia-Pacific region over time. We plan to strategically invest in new markets based on our assessment of market size and opportunity and prospects for compelling reimbursement.
Market Overview
Our Addressable Market Opportunity in BPH
In the United States, BPH is the number one reason men visit a urologist. BPH is estimated to occur in more than 50% of men in their 50s, growing to 70% of men in their 60s, and is the fourth most common diagnosed disease in men above 50 years old, ranking behind coronary artery disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. BPH often results in uncomfortable LUTS, which can have a significant impact on quality of life. If left untreated, BPH may eventually lead to more serious complications. 
In the United States, we estimate that approximately 40 million men are impacted by symptoms of BPH, with aging demographics expected to drive future growth. Over the next ten years, we expect that the number of men over 65 years old in the United States will double and include a corresponding increase in the number of men with enlarged prostates. Of these men, approximately 12 million are being managed by a physician for symptoms related to their disease. While drug therapy is typically a first line treatment option, limited efficacy and negative side effects contribute to low patient compliance, high failure rates and drop outs. On the other hand, surgical intervention is proven to provide effective and durable symptom relief compared to drug therapy, but the use of surgery is significantly underpenetrated, largely due to the compromise patients must make between (1) the incidence of irreversible side effects associated with current resective surgical interventions, or (2) the lower rates of efficacy and durability associated with non-resective surgical interventions. Our total addressable patient population in the United States includes approximately 8.2 million patients, comprised of 6.7 million receiving drug therapy, 1.1 million who have tried but failed drug therapy and 400,000 undergoing surgical intervention each year. Based on the average selling price of our single-use handpiece, we estimate that our total addressable market opportunity is in excess of $20 billion in the United States. The global incidence of BPH among men over 50 years old is similar to that of the United States, representing a significant incremental market opportunity outside of the United States. 
Overview of the Prostate
The prostate is a small gland in the male reproductive system. The main role of the prostate is to produce the fluid that protects and gives nutrients to sperm. The prostate sits underneath the bladder and surrounds the top part of the urethra, which carries urine from the bladder.
Overview of the Prostate and Surrounding Structures
The prostate is approximately the size of a walnut in men younger than 30 years old; as men age, the prostate grows larger. At puberty, testosterone levels in boys start to increase and the prostate grows to about eight times its size. The prostate continues to grow, doubling in size between the ages of 21 and 50 years, and almost doubles again in size between the ages of 50 and 80 years. Prostate size is generally measured in volume using milliliters, or ml. 
BPH Disease Overview and Diagnosis
BPH refers to the non-malignant enlargement of the prostate gland. As the prostate enlarges, the gland presses against the urethra, which may obstruct or restrict the flow of urine from the bladder and result in uncomfortable LUTS, such as urgency, frequency, urinary retention, straining to urinate and a weak urinary stream. Without treatment, prolonged obstruction may eventually lead to acute urinary retention, urinary tract infections or renal insufficiency. An enlarged prostate can range between roughly 30 ml to above 300 ml. As prostates increase in size so does the complexity of shape where the obstructive tissue will grow back into the bladder (called an intravesical component).
Normal Prostate versus Enlarged Prostate
While some BPH patients are asymptomatic, most will experience symptoms, which generally become more bothersome with age. According to the AUA guidelines, it is estimated that 90% of men between the ages of 45 and 80 will experience LUTS, and 50% of them will experience moderate-to-severe symptoms by the time they are 85 years old, which we believe are predominantly caused by BPH. Furthermore, 50% of men between the ages of 51-60 have pathological BPH. Symptoms associated with BPH can have a significant impact on a patient’s quality of life, including inability to sleep through the night, limiting activities due to proximity to the bathroom, impact on relationships, professional life and social activities, ongoing embarrassment and frustration and impact on sexual function. According to our internal marketing survey, 99% of men diagnosed with BPH say symptoms impact their quality of life. 
Clinical diagnosis of BPH typically involves a number of tests that are used to assess the degree of LUTS and determine whether the symptoms are caused by BPH or another condition. A symptom score index utilizes standardized questionnaires to quantify a patient’s degree of LUTS. One of the most common scoring systems is the International Prostate Symptom Score, or IPSS. Using this scoring system, LUTS are classified as either mild, moderate or severe. The IPSS questionnaire is a key tool used to evaluate treatment options and assess treatment success. Other commonly used tests include a digital rectal exam, urine sample tests, imaging scans, blood tests and uroflowmetry tests, which measure the strength and amount of urine flow during urination. Patients suffering from symptoms of BPH are typically first seen by a primary care physician, who may diagnose and manage the patient, or refer the patient to a urologist. A urologist is a physician who specializes in diseases of the urinary tract in both males and females as well as the male reproductive system. Urologists are trained to perform surgery for various types of urologic conditions, including BPH. 
BPH Treatment Options
The main goal of BPH treatment is to alleviate the symptoms associated with the disease and improve the patient’s quality of life. As such, a patient’s recommended course of treatment is largely based on the patient’s degree of symptoms, typically measured using validated scoring systems such as IPSS. Patients with mild symptoms who have not developed other complications of BPH may choose watchful waiting, meaning that before proceeding with active treatment, the physician and patient wait to see if symptoms get worse or if new symptoms develop. Patients who choose this approach are generally advised to implement lifestyle changes and return for yearly visits with their physician to determine if symptoms are changing. For most men, the prostate will continue to grow and symptoms will worsen. As symptoms become more bothersome, active treatment may be recommended. The two primary categories of active treatment for BPH are drug therapy and surgical intervention.
Drug Therapy
Drug therapy is often the first step in actively treating mild-to-moderate symptoms of BPH. While there is no pharmacological cure for BPH, drugs may be used to manage symptoms. Available drugs address symptoms by either shrinking (5-alpha reductase inhibitors) the prostate or relaxing (alpha blockers) muscles surrounding the prostate. In some instances, patients may be prescribed a combination of both medications. Most men with BPH who start drug therapy will need to continue it indefinitely in order to relieve symptoms, unless they choose to undergo surgical intervention. While drug therapy can provide relief for some men, two out of three patients are not satisfied with the effectiveness of their medication. In general, drug therapy provides IPSS reduction of approximately five points and flow improvement of up to 2.5 ml per second. Drug therapy is also often associated with negative side effects, including headaches, dizziness, nausea, erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, loss of libido, cardiac failure and dementia. These side effects often contribute to poor treatment compliance, with drug therapy failing in up to 30% of men within two years. Furthermore, drug therapy may be costly, particularly in light of limited symptom relief. For example, a recent study has shown that payor costs for branded combination drug therapy over a two-year period was the least cost-effective of all treatment options included in the study, as drug therapy requires extended use and yields the least symptom relief. 
Surgical Intervention
Surgical intervention is recommended for patients who have failed or are unwilling to consider drug therapy, or are suffering from complications due to their BPH. Although more invasive than drug therapy, surgical intervention generally provides more significant, longer-lasting symptom relief. We estimate that approximately 400,000 BPH surgeries were performed in the United States in 2019, growing at a compounded annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 11% since 2016. We believe that growth in the use of surgical intervention over the past several years is due to the introduction of new technologies that better balance the compromise between efficacy and safety as well as growing awareness of surgical intervention as an effective way to manage BPH symptoms compared to drug therapy. 
There are two categories of surgical intervention, resective, where obstructive tissue is removed at the time of intervention, and non-resective, where obstructive tissue is not removed, but rather the prostatic urethra is re-shaped. 
Resective Procedures. In resective surgery, tissue is removed during the procedure. Resective prostate procedures generally provide more significant and longer-lasting symptom relief than non-resective procedures, but may result in a higher incidence of irreversible complications, including urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory dysfunction. Resective procedures generally provide IPSS reduction of approximately 15 points. These procedures are typically performed in the hospital or outpatient surgery center under general or spinal anesthesia. In 2019, approximately 290,000 resective surgeries were performed in the United States, accounting for over 70% of all BPH surgeries. 
Resective surgeries may be performed endoscopically, allowing the procedure to be completed through a tubular instrument, or via an open or a laparoscopic procedure, called a simple prostatectomy. 
Endoscopic procedures access the prostate through the urethra, so no incisions are made in the patient’s abdomen. These procedures typically use heat-based technologies to resect prostate tissue, utilizing a single camera called a cystoscope that provides limited visualization of the anatomy during the procedure. Common alternative endoscopic resective procedures include:
•Transurethral Resection of the Prostate. TURP is a resective procedure which uses electrocautery to cut and remove prostate tissue. Despite being used for almost a century, this procedure is still the most frequently performed resective surgery and is considered the historical standard of care for the surgical treatment of BPH for prostates less than 80 ml. In 2019, approximately 135,000 TURP procedures were performed in the United States. 
•Photoselective Vaporization of the Prostate, or PVP. PVP is a transurethral form of treatment that utilizes a laser fiber to vaporize prostate tissue sequentially outwards until the surgeon creates a sufficient cavity through which the patient may now void. PVP is generally used in patients with small- to average-sized prostates and can be used in patients who are at high risk of bleeding complications. In 2019, approximately 80,000 PVP procedures were performed in the United States.
•Laser Enucleation of the Prostate. Laser enucleation utilizes a surgical laser to manually resect prostate tissue through the urethra. This procedure allows the surgeon to follow anatomic planes to separate entire lobes of the prostate. In general, separated prostate lobes are then pushed into the bladder and suctioned out via a special tool. Laser enucleation is prostate size-independent; however, this procedure is more commonly used in larger prostates, and adoption has been limited due to the high degree of skill and experience required. In 2019, approximately 30,000 enucleation procedures were performed in the United States.
A simple prostatectomy is an invasive, open procedure that requires one or more incisions to be made in the patient’s abdomen to access and remove part or all of the prostate. This procedure is typically a last resort treatment for BPH in patients with very large prostates or those patients with severe complications due to BPH. This surgery may be done manually, or with the assistance of a robot, but in either case is a procedure that requires a high degree of surgeon skill. In 2019, approximately 25,000 prostatectomy procedures were performed for the treatment of BPH in the United States.
Non-Resective Procedures. In non-resective procedures, prostate tissue is not removed at the time of surgery. By not removing tissue, symptom relief is generally less significant and durable compared to resective procedures. Non-resective procedures generally provide IPSS reduction of approximately ten points. The two most common commercially available non-resective procedures are prostatic urethral lift, or PUL, and water vapor therapy. PUL uses permanent implants of nitinol and stainless steel placed transurethrally to pin back and compress obstructing prostate tissue, thus creating a channel for improved urinary flow. Water vapor therapy utilizes principles of convection by transurethrally delivering water vapor into obstructing prostate tissue, which results in cell death and reduction of prostate volume over a period of three to six months. Non-resective procedures are generally approved for small- to average-sized prostates. In 2019, approximately 105,000 non-resective surgeries were performed in the United States.
Limitations of Alternative Surgical Interventions
Two factors that surgeons and patients commonly consider when evaluating surgical intervention are efficacy and safety. Efficacy is generally measured by symptom relief as well as durability of relief, and safety by the occurrence of irreversible complications such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory dysfunction. We believe that alternative surgical interventions for BPH require patients to compromise between efficacy and safety. Alternative interventions either provide significant symptom relief with a heightened risk of irreversible complications or a lower risk of complications with significantly less symptom relief. In addition, most alternative surgical interventions are limited by prostate size and shape, with no single procedure capable of effectively addressing the full range of prostate anatomies regardless of surgeon experience level. We believe that the compromise and limitations associated with alternative surgical interventions have contributed to the relatively low penetration rate of surgical intervention. 
Limitations of Endoscopic Resective Procedures. While endoscopic resective surgeries such as TURP and laser-based procedures may provide BPH patients with durable symptom relief, these procedures have a number of limitations, including:
•High rates of irreversible complications. Irreversible complications are a common side effect of endoscopic resective procedures. Published studies have shown rates of erectile dysfunction as high as 14%, 20% and 8%, ejaculatory dysfunction as high as 89%, 50% and 77%, and incontinence as high as 2%, 2%, and 33% for TURP, PVP and laser enucleation, respectively. We believe the high rates of irreversible complications are in large part due to these technologies utilizing heat to remove prostate tissue, which may lead to unintended thermal damage to critical parts of the anatomy. Furthermore, minimal intraoperative visualization, which is generally limited to a cystoscope, provides limited visibility of the prostate and makes it difficult for the surgeon to see and preserve critical parts of the prostate during tissue resection. This results in highly variable depth of tissue penetration, damage to tissue which may extend deeper than cavity created, a potential for unintended prostate capsule perforation, potential damage to nerve bundle responsible for erectile function, and delayed healing of prostatic urethra.
•Prostate size limitations. While TURP is considered the standard of care for surgical treatment of BPH, it is generally reserved for small- to average-sized prostates below 80 ml given the length and manual nature of the 
procedure. For laser-based therapies, PVP is also most commonly used for small- to average-sized prostates, while laser enucleation is generally reserved for treating patients with larger prostates.
•Experience dependent outcomes and long learning curves. Endoscopic resective procedures rely on manual resection of the prostate, with clinical outcomes often highly dependent on the surgeon’s experience level. For example, a study of a large number of patients undergoing TURP found that the rate of reoperation was 1.2-fold higher in men treated by surgeons who had performed 172 or fewer TURP procedures versus surgeons that had performed more than 402 TURP procedures. In addition, a study of 200 procedures by a surgeon performing PVP showed that the surgeon required at least 120 procedures to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. Furthermore, a study of surgeons learning to perform laser enucleation demonstrated that one-third of the surgeons failed to complete the training program. 
•Inconsistent and lengthy resection times. Endoscopic resective procedures require manual resection of prostate tissue performed under limited visualization. This manual process contributes to highly inconsistent and lengthy resection times that are strongly correlated with prostate size.
Limitations of a Simple Prostatectomy. While a simple prostatectomy typically provides maximum symptom relief by removing part or all of the prostate gland, this procedure is generally considered a treatment of last resort reserved for patients with large prostates. Limitations of a simple prostatectomy include:
•Surgical safety concerns. Even when performed robotically, a simple prostatectomy still requires incisions to be made in the patient’s abdomen in order to access the prostate gland. Bleeding events are a key risk in these types of procedures, with transfusion rates as high as 25%.
•High rates of irreversible complications. Similar to endoscopic resective procedures, open procedures commonly result in high rates of irreversible complications, with studies showing erectile, ejaculatory dysfunction, and incontinence rates as high as 2-3%, 90% and 8%, respectively.
•Long hospital stay and recovery time. Given the invasiveness of open procedures, long hospital stays and post-procedure recovery are common. In addition, patients typically stay in the hospital for an average of five days after surgery and have long recovery times.
Limitations of Non-Resective Procedures. While non-resective procedures are associated with favorable safety profiles and limited impact on sexual function, these procedures generally deliver lower and less durable symptom relief than resective procedures. Limitations of non-resective procedures include:
•Limited symptom relief and durability. By not removing obstructive prostate tissue, non-resective procedures generally results in less significant and durable symptom relief compared to resective procedures. In addition, since prostate tissue continues to grow over time, durability of symptom relief is typically less favorable in non-resective procedures, with higher rates of patients needing to undergo surgical retreatment or go back on drugs. For example, five-year surgical retreatment rates for PUL and water vapor therapy were 13.6% and 4.4%, respectively. In addition, the rates of PUL and water vapor therapy patients back on drug therapy at five years were 10.7% and 11.1%, respectively. Furthermore, since PUL requires the use of a permanent implant, there is risk of post-operative complications due to the implant which may require implant removal, with a published five-year rate of implant removal of 9.3%.
•Limited intraoperative visualization. Similar to endoscopic resective procedures, the surgeon’s view of the prostate in endoscopic non-resective procedures is limited to a cystoscope that provides minimal visibility of the prostate.
•Prostate size and shape limitations. Both PUL and water vapor therapy are generally used for small- to average-sized prostates. Unlike any of the resective procedures, both of these procedures are specifically limited by the FDA for use in certain prostate sizes. The mean prostate volumes for PUL and water vapor therapy were 45 ml and 46 ml, respectively, in their respective U.S. pivotal, prospective, randomized clinical trials. In addition, the use of these procedures may be limited for certain complex prostate shapes.
Our Solution
We have developed the AquaBeam Robotic System, an advanced, image-guided, surgical robotic system for use in minimally invasive urologic surgery. Our proprietary AquaBeam Robotic System delivers our Aquablation therapy, the first and only image-guided robotic therapy for the treatment of BPH. We market the AquaBeam Robotic System in the 
United States pursuant to FDA 510(k) clearance that we received in March 2021. The most common side effects observed for Aquablation therapy are mild and transient and may include mild pain or difficulty when urinating, discomfort in the pelvis, blood in the urine, inability to empty the bladder or a frequent or urgent need to urinate, and bladder or urinary tract infection. During our clinical studies, we documented a rate of incontinence between 0%-2%, ejaculatory dysfunction between 6.9%-24.6%, and a peri-operative transfusion rate between 0.9%-5.9%. Since then, a number of publications have reported on transfusion rates. A key study published in April 2021 of 2,089 men undergoing Aquablation therapy with prostates ranging in size from 20 ml to 363 ml observed a transfusion rate of only 0.8%.
The AquaBeam Robotic System combines the following highly differentiated features that are intended to deliver effective, safe and durable outcomes for males suffering from LUTS due to BPH that are consistent across all prostate sizes and shapes and independent of surgeon experience:
•Real-time image guidance. Intraoperative ultrasound imaging combined with cystoscopic visualization, which provides a multidimensional view of the treatment area, enabling improved decision-making and real-time treatment monitoring. 
•Personalized treatment planning. Using ultrasound imaging integrated with advanced planning software, the surgeon is able to map the treatment contour that precisely targets the resection area, personalizing the optimal tissue removal plan based on each patient’s unique anatomy. 
•Automated robotic execution. Once the treatment plan is finalized, the robot automatically executes the plan, guiding the precisely calibrated waterjet with speed and accuracy while the surgeon monitors.
•Heat-free waterjet resection. Utilizing the unique power of a pulsating waterjet near the speed of sound, Aquablation therapy removes prostatic tissue with a heat-free waterjet, minimizing the risk of complications arising from prolonged thermal injury.
Components of the AquaBeam Robotic System
The AquaBeam Robotic System is highly mobile and compact, requiring no retrofitting of the operating room. The main components of the AquaBeam Robotic System are the conformal planning unit, or CPU, console, motorpack and handpiece with integrated scope. 
The CPU serves as the primary user interface of the AquaBeam Robotic System, displaying live transrectal ultrasound, or TRUS, video which allows the surgeon to visualize the prostate and surrounding structures, identify key anatomical markers and personalize the resection based on the patient’s unique anatomy. Through an intuitive user interface, the CPU allows the surgeon to map the contour of the prostate and plan the resection pathway by selecting the resection angles, length and depth. The planned parameters of the resection are transferred to the console to initiate Aquablation therapy. 
During the procedure, the surgeon utilizes the CPU to observe the progress of the resection in real time and has the option to make adjustments to the treatment area as needed. The CPU is equipped with a variety of integrated safety mechanisms that provide the surgeon with advisory notifications during treatment.
The console contains a high-pressure pumping system that is responsible for generating the high-velocity waterjet used in Aquablation therapy. The high-pressure pumping system consists of a control unit and powerboards that drive the positioning and flow rates of the waterjet. In addition, the console utilizes a peristaltic pump that assists in active evacuation of saline and tissue from the bladder and prostatic urethra during the Aquablation therapy to manage fluid levels. The console interfaces with both the CPU and motorpack and handpiece assembly, generating the water flow rates based on instructions received from the CPU. The console is activated by a foot pedal and has a small screen that displays the pump level and procedure mode.
The motorpack is connected to the console with a flexible cable that provides power and control instructions to the motorpack. The motorpack consists of a motor control system that drives the movement and position of the waterjet nozzle in the handpiece and is designed to mechanically dock with the handpiece, completing the waterjet drive mechanism as well as establishing a secure electrical connection. The motorpack has buttons that allow a surgeon to manually increase or decrease the pump power level during resection, if needed.
The handpiece is the sterile, single-use component of the AquaBeam Robotic System that delivers the high-velocity waterjet. The tip of the handpiece is inserted transurethrally into the patient, advanced through the prostatic urethra into the bladder and positioned using both TRUS imaging and cystoscopic guidance from the integrated, reusable scope. The motorpack and handpiece assembly is secured to an articulating arm. The start treatment location, end treatment location, depth and angle of resection are based on the transferred planned contour and profile from the CPU to the console and motorpack.
The AquaBeam Robotic System also includes a customized ultrasound set through which ultrasound images are integrated with our system.
Treatment with Aquablation Therapy
Aquablation therapy is currently performed in the hospital setting in a procedure that typically takes less than one hour. On the day of surgery, the patient is given either general or spinal anesthesia and then prepped and positioned on their back with their knees bent above the hips and legs spread apart using stirrups, similar to other BPH surgical procedures. The 
procedure begins with the insertion of the TRUS probe, followed by the insertion of the handpiece into the patient’s bladder through the urethra under visual guidance from the integrated scope. The surgeon confirms successful positioning of the TRUS probe and handpiece with visual markers on the CPU screen with adjustments made by advancing, retracting and rotating the TRUS probe. Once positioning is confirmed, the TRUS probe and motorpack and handpiece assembly are secured to articulating arms that are mounted to the bed rails to prevent movement during planning and the procedure. 
The surgeon begins the planning process via the user interface of the CPU. Using real-time TRUS imaging displayed on the CPU to visualize the anatomy of the prostate, the surgeon plans the treatment area. The surgeon defines the treatment area by adjusting the boundaries of treatment along the length, width and height of the prostate. The boundaries serve as a tissue depth guide to help maintain the resection within the treatment area. If a median lobe is present, the surgeon can visualize and separately plan the resection of the median lobe. Once planning and mapping are complete, the surgeon then begins resection by depressing the foot pedal to initiate the high-velocity waterjet, with the resection automatically executed based on the defined treatment plan. As the waterjet removes prostate tissue along the planned treatment contour, excess water and ablated tissue are actively suctioned out of the patient. The surgeon monitors the progress of the resection on the CPU and, at any point during the procedure, the surgeon can pause the treatment by releasing the foot pedal. Using buttons on the motorpack, the surgeon can manually decrease the resection depths in real time as the procedure is monitored on both live ultrasound and cystoscopy. Aquablation therapy treatment stops upon reaching the planned treatment endpoint. The surgeon may decide to plan additional resection passes depending on the length or depth of the prostate. 
When the procedure is complete, the motorpack and handpiece assembly is undocked from the articulating arm. The surgeon can manually scan the treatment area endoscopically by using the integrated scope of the handpiece. After post-procedural cystoscopy is complete, the handpiece is removed from the urethra. The surgeon may then use a resectoscope to remove ablated tissue to improve visualization and then perform focal, targeted and methodical bladder neck cautery to achieve post-operative hemostasis, or a state where the bleeding has stopped. Following the procedure, the patients are typically monitored in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit, or PACU, with the majority of patients discharged after one overnight stay, without needing to leave with a catheter. 
Key Benefits of Aquablation Therapy
We believe our Aquablation therapy addresses the compromise between safety and efficacy of alternative surgical interventions, providing the following unique benefits:
•Significant and durable symptom relief. Given obstructive prostate tissue is removed during the procedure, Aquablation therapy has demonstrated significant and long-lasting levels of symptom relief similar to those of alternative resective procedures. The efficacy of Aquablation therapy has been evaluated in nine clinical studies and over 100 peer reviewed publications. Significant symptom reduction, quality of life and uroflowmetry improvements were observed across the WATER, WATER II and OPEN WATER studies. In the WATER study, Aquablation therapy demonstrated superior safety and non-inferior efficacy results compared to TURP, the historical standard of care for the surgical treatment of BPH. Our studies have also demonstrated durable outcomes with low rates of surgical retreatment and few men having to go back on drugs following surgery. In the WATER and WATER II studies, surgical retreatment rates were only 5.2% at five years and 3.0% at four years, respectively. In the OPEN WATER study, there were no surgical retreatments at one year.
•Uncompromised safety profile. Aquablation therapy has demonstrated low rates of irreversible complications, including urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory dysfunction, compared to published rates observed for other resective surgeries. In our WATER study, patients who underwent Aquablation therapy maintained a higher level of sexual function compared to those who underwent TURP. We believe the strong safety profile of Aquablation therapy is a result of the therapy’s ability to preserve key anatomical structures and limit prolonged and unintended thermal injury. In addition, no implant remains in the body with Aquablation therapy, minimizing the risk of mid-to-long term post-operative complications resulting from the implant. 
•Outcomes consistent across all prostate sizes and shapes and independent of surgeon experience. We designed Aquablation therapy to deliver outcomes that are effective, safe and durable for males suffering from LUTS due to BPH across all prostate sizes and shapes. Our WATER, WATER II and OPEN WATER studies enrolled men with prostate sizes between 20 ml and 150 ml; however, in the commercial setting, we have successfully treated men with prostate sizes over 300 ml. Additionally, in the WATER and WATER II studies, 50% and 83% of men, respectively, had an obstructive median lobe, and the average prostate size in each study was 54 ml and 107 ml, respectively. Compared to other resective procedures, we believe Aquablation therapy is relatively simple to learn, enabled by the intuitive interface of the CPU and automated robotic resection, and delivers outcomes that are 
independent of surgeon experience. In the WATER study, 14 of the 17 participating surgeons had no previous experience with Aquablation therapy, and in the WATER II study surgeons had a median previous experience of only 0.5 procedures. 
•Personalized treatment planning and improved decision-making. Aquablation therapy combines cystoscopic visualization, ultrasound imaging and advanced planning software. Together, these technologies provide the surgeon with a multidimensional view of the treatment area and enable personalized treatment planning for the patient’s unique anatomy, improved decision-making and real-time monitoring during the procedure. 
•Targeted and controlled resection with consistent resection times. Aquablation therapy utilizes automated robotic resection to remove prostate tissue using a precise, heat-free waterjet. These features enable targeted and controlled tissue removal with rapid resection times that are highly consistent across prostate sizes and shapes and surgeon experience. 
Our Clinical Results and Studies
A significant body of clinical evidence supports the efficacy, safety and durability of Aquablation therapy across prostate sizes and shapes as well as surgeon experience. This robust body of evidence includes more than 100 peer-reviewed publications in premier journals, such as the Journal of Urology, European Urology and BJU International, as well as nine clinical studies, including our three core studies: WATER, WATER II and OPEN WATER. 
•WATER. The WATER study was double-blind, randomized, controlled study of Aquablation therapy against TURP in men with prostate sizes between 30 ml and 80 ml. This study is the only FDA pivotal trial for BPH randomized against TURP. The study was designed with 80% power to show superiority in safety and more than 80% power to show non-inferiority in efficacy. The results of our WATER study served as the basis for FDA grant of our De Novo request and were first published in the Journal of Urology in 2018. 
•WATER II. The WATER II study was a prospective, multicenter study of Aquablation therapy in patients with prostate sizes between 80 ml and 150 ml. The study was designed with 80% power for safety and 99% power for efficacy against an objective performance criteria, or OPC, based upon TURP data, even though TURP procedures are typically performed in smaller prostates. The results of the WATER II study served as the basis for increased reimbursement and coverage and were first published in BJU International in 2019.
•OPEN WATER. The OPEN WATER study was a prospective, multicenter, all-comer study conducted in a commercial setting spanning patients with prostate sizes between 20 ml and 150 ml. Due to the size of this study, it was sufficiently powered to statistical conclusions with the data. There was no OPC established for this study. The results of the OPEN WATER study were first published in Journal of Clinical Medicine in 2020.
The following table highlights key findings from our three core studies.

Efficacy and Durability
The most common measure of efficacy in BPH clinical research is symptom relief measured by improvement in IPSS. IPSS is a validated, standardized questionnaire used to quantify a patient’s degree of LUTS. The questionnaire is comprised of seven questions that characterize urinary dysfunction. Scores range from 0 to 35, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms. A total score of 7 or less indicates mild symptoms, 8 to 19 indicates moderate symptoms and 20 to 30 indicates severe symptoms. The IPSS-Quality of Life, or IPSS-QoL, is a single question with a score of 0 to 6 that asks the patient how he would feel if he had to spend the rest of his life with his current urinary symptoms. A higher score indicates a higher level of dissatisfaction. Uroflowmetry tests, which measure the strength and amount of urine flow during urination, are also used to measure efficacy, with Qmax being the primary measurement. Qmax is a measure of the max urinary flow rate. A study of 348 18-year-old males showed the majority of men had a Qmax of 20 ml/s or higher.
Our core clinical studies have demonstrated the strong efficacy of Aquablation therapy across prostate sizes and shapes. The following figures highlight efficacy results for IPSS scores, IPSS-QoL scores and Qmax at various points in time across these studies. All changes for IPSS, IPPS-QoL, and Qmax had a statistically significant change from baseline (p <0.0001).
An important factor related to efficacy is durability, which is commonly measured by freedom from surgical retreatment due to recurrent LUTS associated with BPH. In addition, since one of the key goals of surgical intervention is to reduce or eliminate the need for drugs, the rate of patients back on drug therapy due to recurrent LUTS associated with BPH is also an important measure of durability. Lower rates of surgical retreatment and being back on drug therapy are more favorable. The table below highlights the strong durability observed across our core clinical studies.

 | OPEN WATER | | WATER II | | WATER(Aquablation arm) | WATER(TURP arm)
Longest Duration of Follow-up | 1 year | | 4 years | | 5 years | 
Surgical retreatment for BPH at longest FU | 0.0 | % | | 3.0 | % | 5.2 | % | 1.5 | %
Surgical retreatment annualized | 0.0 | % | | 0.8 | % | 1.0 | % | 0.3 | %
Back on BPH medication at longest FU | 3.4 | % | | 6.9 | % | 0.9 | % | 10.8 | %
Back on BPH medication annualized | 3.4 | % | | 1.7 | % | 0.2 | % | 2.2 | %

Safety 
A key measure of safety used in BPH clinical research is the rate of irreversible complications, which includes urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory dysfunction. Urinary incontinence refers to the loss of bladder control, resulting in the occasional leak of urine. Erectile dysfunction refers to the inability to get or maintain an erection firm enough for sexual intercourse. Ejaculatory dysfunction refers to the inability of a man to efficiently ejaculate semen from the penis at the moment of sexual climax.
Aquablation therapy has demonstrated low rates of irreversible complications across our core studies, with consistently low rates of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory dysfunction risk as low 10% in sexually active men. The table below highlights the strong safety profile observed across our core clinical studies.

 | OPEN WATER | | WATER II | | WATER(Aquablation arm) | WATER(TURP arm)
Incontinence | 0.0 | % | | 2.0 | % | 0.0 | % | 0.0 | %
Erectile dysfunction | 0.0 | % | | 0.0 | % | 0.0 | % | 0.0 | %
Ejaculatory dysfunction (% in sexually active) | 8.4% (11.9%) | | 14.9% (19.5%) | | 6.9% (10.3%) | 24.6% (35.6%) 

Surgical Standardization 
The efficacy, safety and durability of Aquablation therapy across prostate sizes and shapes has been evaluated across our three core studies. These studies have also demonstrated that outcomes are independent of surgeon experience. For example, in the WATER study, 14 of the 17 participating surgeons had no previous experience with Aquablation therapy and, in the WATER II study, participating surgeons had a median previous experience with Aquablation therapy of only 0.5 procedures. We believe the short learning curve associated with Aquablation therapy is in large part due to pre-operative planning capabilities and automated robotic execution.
Another key outcome observed across our core studies was consistency of operative and resection times. Regardless of prostate size or shape, the procedure setup and planning processes are the same. Once the surgeon has established the treatment area, the tissue resection is robotically executed, resulting in efficient resection times that are consistent across prostate sizes. The chart below demonstrates consistent resection times observed across our WATER and WATER II studies in prostate sizes between 30 ml and 150 ml. These resection times are in contrast to the highly variable data observed in the TURP arm of the WATER study, which is a key reason why TURP is generally limited to prostate sizes below 80 ml.
WATER 
The WATER study was a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled study of Aquablation therapy against TURP for the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH in men with prostate sizes between 30 ml and 80 ml. One hundred eighty-one patients were enrolled and treated in the study, with 116 undergoing Aquablation therapy and 65 undergoing TURP, across 17 investigational sites. The study commenced in October 2015, and the results were first published in May 2018 in the Journal of Urology.
At baseline for patients undergoing Aquablation therapy, the mean age was 66.0 years, the mean prostate size was 54.1 ml, with 54.1% of patients presenting with an obstructive median lobe, the mean IPSS score was 22.9, the mean IPSS-QoL score was 4.8 and the mean Qmax was 9.4 ml/s. At baseline for patients undergoing TURP, the mean age was 65.8 years, the mean prostate size was 51.8 ml, with 52.0% of patients presenting with an obstructive median lobe, the mean IPSS score was 22.2, the mean IPSS-QoL score was 4.8 and the mean Qmax was 9.1 ml/s.
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in IPSS at six months compared to baseline for the Aquablation therapy treatment arm randomized against the TURP arm. The primary safety endpoint was the occurrence of Clavien-Dindo persistent grade 1 or grade 2 or higher perioperative complications at three months. The study is planned to follow patients for five years, with three-year data currently published.
Mean total operative time was similar for the Aquablation therapy and TURP treatment arms (33 vs 36 minutes, p = 0.2752), but resection time was lower for Aquablation therapy (4 vs 27 minutes, p <0.0001). Fourteen of the 17 participating surgeons had no previous experience with Aquablation therapy.
Efficacy and Durability Results
The study successfully achieved its primary efficacy endpoint, with Aquablation therapy showing non-inferior symptom relief compared to TURP. Analysis of a patient subgroup with prostates above 50 ml demonstrated that Aquablation therapy was superior to TURP in symptom reduction.
At six months, mean IPSS scores decreased from 22.9 at baseline to 5.9 in the Aquablation therapy treatment arm and from 22.2 at baseline to 6.8 in the TURP group. The IPSS change score at month six was 1.8 points larger for the Aquablation therapy treatment arm (95% CI -0.4 to 4.0). The lower confidence limit of the difference was above the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 4.7, substantiating statistical and clinical non-inferiority of efficacy results. 
The baseline IPSS average for the study was 22.6 and did not differ between treatment groups. Mean (SD) IPSS reduction at five years was 15.1 (6.6) in the Aquablation therapy group and 13.2 (8.2) in the TURP group (p=.2764 for difference). At five years, the median IPSS score was 5.5 for Aquablation therapy and 6 for TURP. For men with larger prostates (≥50 ml), IPSS reduction was 3.5 points greater in the Aquablation therapy group compared to the TURP group (p=.0123, repeated measures analysis of variance). There was no difference in IPSS changes when analyzing the other pre-specified subgroups of age (<65 vs. ≥65) and LUTS severity as measured by IPSS (<20 vs. ≥20). The IPSS quality of life score can range from 0 to 6. The baseline IPSS quality of life average for the study was 4.8 and did not differ between treatment groups. At five years, the IPSS QoL score was 1.6 for both arms and showed no statistical difference in change scores, p=.8009.
In both groups, five-year peak urinary flow rates (Qmax) increased markedly within one month after surgery and were maintained at five years. Mean five-year improvements in Qmax were 8.7 (9.1) ml/sec, or 125% improvement, for the Aquablation therapy group versus 6.3 (7.5) ml/sec, or 89% improvement, for TURP. The mean five-year reduction in post-void residual was 62 (86) and 82 (94) ml (p=.3960). 
At five-year follow-up for Aquablation therapy, 6.0% of patients needed an additional BPH therapy (started BPH medication anew and continued to study exit or intervention) due to recurrent LUTS, which was 51% less than the TURP arm. In the TURP arm, 12.3% of patients needed additional BPH therapy. The average IPSS score before the additional BPH therapy was similar in both arms, 14 for Aquablation therapy and 15 for TURP, and did not differ whether the patient chose to undergo another intervention or start medication. 
Safety
The primary safety endpoint was successfully achieved at three months where the Aquablation therapy group had a lower event rate compared to TURP (26% vs. 42%, p=.0149 for superiority). Urinary complications from three to five years did not differ between groups. The tabular details of these events were previously published. The rate of persistent grade 1 events at month three was lower (7% vs. 25%, p=.0004) after Aquablation, and the rate of grade 2 and above events was similar across groups (20% for Aquablation vs. 23% for TURP, p=.3038). There were zero de novo erectile dysfunction events or incontinence events requiring a pad in either arm. However, procedure-related anejaculation was less common after Aquablation, 7%, versus TURP, 25%, p=.0004. The transfusion rates in the Aquablation therapy and TURP treatment arms were 0.9% and 0.0%, respectively, and not statistically different. Published transfusion rates of TURP, typically performed in prostates sizes of less than 80 ml, are in the range of 1.8% - 2.8%.
WATER II
The WATER II study was a prospective, multicenter single-arm study for the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH in men with prostate sizes between 80 ml and 150 ml. One hundred and one patients were enrolled and treated in the study across 16 investigational sites. The study commenced in 2017, and the results were first published BJU International in March 2019.
At baseline for patients in the study, the mean age was 67.5 years, the mean prostate size was 107.4 ml, with 83.2% of patients presenting with an obstructive median lobe, the mean IPSS score was 23.2, the mean IPSS-QoL score was 4.6 and the mean Qmax was 8.7 ml/s. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was IPSS reduction. Secondary efficacy endpoints include IPSS-QoL score, maximum urinary flow rate, post-void residual urine volume and prostate-specific antigen concentration. The primary safety endpoint was the percentage of Clavien–Dindo grade 2 or higher or any grade 1 event resulting in persistent disability. The study is planned to follow patients for five years, with three-year data having already been collected and analyzed.
Mean total operative and resection time was 55 minutes and eight minutes, respectively. Participating surgeons had a median previous experience with Aquablation therapy of only 0.5 procedures.
Efficacy and Durability
The study met its primary and secondary efficacy endpoints showing the Aquablation procedure’s ability to provide significant symptom relief in large prostates and is a size independent procedure. The mean IPSS improved from 23.2 at baseline to 6.7 at three months (p <0.001), which is a 17.4-point improvement and meeting the study’s primary efficacy endpoint goal. At four years, mean IPSS decreased from 23.2 at baseline to 5.5, mean IPSS-QoL decreased from 4.6 to 1.2 and mean Qmax increased from 8.7 ml/s to 17.1 ml/s.
Four-year surgical retreatment rate was 3.0%. There were no surgical retreatments for BPH beyond 36 months. At four years, the rate of patients that were back on drug therapy was 6.9%.
Safety
The study met its primary safety endpoint of Clavien–Dindo grade 2 or higher or any grade 1 event resulting in persistent disability. At three months, this occurred in 45.5% of men, which met the study design goal of less than 65%. Consistent with the results of the WATER study, WATER II observed low rates of irreversible complications: 2% new onset urinary incontinence and, among sexually active men, 0% erectile dysfunction and 19% ejaculatory dysfunction.
While the primary safety endpoint was achieved, the procedure was done without any cauterization to achieve hemostasis, or a state where the bleeding has stopped. As a result, we experienced peri-operative transfusions, or transfusions that occur prior to a patient being discharged from the hospital, at a rate of 5.9%. We worked with numerous surgeons to identify the optimal hemostasis method that would work across all prostate sizes. That method, focal bladder neck cautery, was formally included as part of the Aquablation therapy training program beginning in January 2020. Since then, a number of publications have reported on transfusion rates. A key study published in April 2021 of 2,089 men undergoing Aquablation therapy with prostates ranging in size from 20 ml to 363 ml observed a transfusion rate of only 0.8%. Published transfusion rates of enucleation and simple prostatectomy, typically performed in prostates with sizes of greater than 80 ml, are in the range of 0.8% to 3.4% and 16% to 25%, respectively. TURP transfusion rates are not provided for comparison because TURP is routinely done in prostates less than 80ml.
OPEN WATER
The OPEN WATER study was a prospective, multicenter, all-comer study conducted in a commercial setting spanning patients with prostate sizes between 20 ml and 150 ml. One hundred and seventy-eight patients were enrolled and treated in the study across five investigational sites. The study commenced in September 2017, and the results were first published in Journal of Clinical Medicine in February 2020.
At baseline for patients in the study, the mean age was 66.0 years, the mean prostate size was 59.3 ml, with 59.6% of patients presenting with an obstructive median lobe, the mean IPSS score was 21.6, the mean IPSS-QoL score was 4.6 and the mean Qmax was 9.9 ml/s.
The study’s primary endpoint was the change in total IPSS score from baseline to three months.
Efficacy and Durability
The primary efficacy endpoint of IPSS reduction was met with mean IPSS scores decreasing from 21.6 at baseline to 7.1 and 6.4 at the three- and 12-month follow-up, respectively. 
The secondary endpoint of IPSS-QoL reduction was also met with mean IPSS-QoL scores decreasing from 4.6 at baseline to 1.5 and 1.4 at 3- and 12-month follow-up, respectively. The maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) increased from 9.9 to 20.3 and 20.8 cc/sec at 3- and 12-month follow-up, respectively and post-void residual urinary volume decreased from 108cc at baseline to 47cc and 61cc at 3- and 12-month follow-up, respectively. All changes for IPSS, IPPS-QoL, and Qmax had a statistically significant change from baseline (p <0.0001). We do not have any plans for additional follow-up with patients in the OPEN WATER study.
There were no cases of surgical retreatment because of recurrent LUTS due to BPH at 12-months, with 3.4% back on drug therapy.
Safety
In terms of safety, irreversible complications were similar to WATER and WATER II; 0% incontinence and among sexually active men 0% erectile dysfunction and 12% ejaculatory dysfunction. 
Following Aquablation therapy, 2.7% of patients underwent a transfusion and 7.9% of patients were taken back to the OR for postoperative hemostasis management. The prostate volumes included in the study spanned both WATER and WATER II, which were a broader range than routinely treated by TURP. The OPEN WATER trial demonstrated a similar transfusion rate of published TURP results (1.8% - 2.8%) where typically used in smaller prostates less than 80 ml. 
Sales and Marketing
Commercial Activities in the United States
We designed our commercial strategy and built our direct sales team to target primarily urologists across the United States, who we believe represent the primary physician specialty managing the care of patients with BPH. We estimate that there are approximately 12,000 urologists who manage approximately 4.3 million BPH patients, comprised of 400,000 undergoing BPH surgery annually, 3.3 million who are on drug therapy and 600,000 who have tried but failed drug therapy. We are first focused on driving adoption of Aquablation therapy among urologists who perform hospital-based BPH resective surgery. We estimate that approximately 290,000 of the 400,000 annual BPH surgeries are resective procedures performed across approximately 2,700 hospitals. We are initially targeting 860 high-volume hospitals that perform, on average, more than 200 resective procedures annually and account for approximately 70% of all hospital-based resective procedures. Within each high-volume hospital, we are focused on targeting urologists who perform medium-to-high volumes of resective procedures and converting their resective cases to Aquablation therapy. As urologists gain experience with Aquablation therapy, we will leverage their experiences to capture more surgical volumes and establish Aquablation therapy as the surgical standard of care. We also intend to leverage our relationships with urologists to drive utilization of Aquablation therapy beyond the current surgical market. Over time, we will gradually expand our focus to also include mid- and low-volume hospitals.
We primarily sell our products through our direct sales organization in the United States. This team actively engages with providers to drive awareness, adoption and utilization of our Aquablation therapy. Our direct sales organization is supported by clinical specialists and professional education employees, who are responsible for training and supporting surgeons, reimbursement specialists, who are responsible for customer and physician education on coding, coverage and payment, and field service employees, who provide preventative maintenance and support for our customers. We intend to expand the size of our direct sales organization to support our efforts for adoption and utilization of Aquablation therapy.
In addition to our direct sales efforts, we support our sales organization with marketing and market development initiatives. We plan to continue to expand and enhance our marketing capabilities to support our growing commercial organization and customer base. Our near-term marketing efforts center principally on increasing awareness and driving adoption of Aquablation therapy among urologists by continuing to publish clinical data in various industry and scientific journals, present our clinical data at various industry conferences, expand our network of KOLs and sponsor peer-to-peer education programs and proctorships. We believe these initiatives will further deepen our relationships with urologists and key medical societies, contributing to our goal of Aquablation therapy becoming the surgical standard of care for BPH surgery. Longer-term, as we expand our network of urologists and grow our installed base, we intend to increase awareness and brand recognition of Aquablation therapy beyond urologists, primarily among primary care physicians who manage BPH patients. To achieve this objective, we will invest in marketing initiatives directed at primary care physicians in order 
to expand networks for BPH patients to visit a urologist. Once we have established a broader installed base of systems, we may seek to further increase patient awareness through various direct-to-patient marketing initiatives.
Commercial Activities Outside of the United States
Our commercialization strategy outside the United States is focused on large addressable markets through a broad range of market development activities, including increasing awareness, obtaining regulatory approvals and establishing reimbursement. We sell our products using both our direct sales organization and, in certain regions, our network of distribution partners. 
In EMEA, our direct sales organization is currently primarily focused on Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Austria. In other countries, such as Italy and Spain, we engage distribution partners to assist us with market development and sales activities. As of December 31, 2021, we employed 13 personnel to support sales and marketing activities in EMEA. We will opportunistically choose distribution partners with clinical and marketing expertise to enter new markets. We are focused on distribution partners that have the capability to assist with surgeon training and, when required, obtaining regulatory approvals. In the Asia-Pacific region, we are focused on obtaining local regulatory clearances with the assistance of our distribution partners in this region. We have regulatory approval in Hong Kong, where we are engaged with a distribution partner for market development activities.
Third-Party Reimbursement
In the United States, we sell our products to hospitals. These customers in turn bill various third-party payors, such as commercial payors and government agencies, for reimbursement for the procedures using our products. Our market access team includes four professionals who are focused on all key aspects of reimbursement, which include securing appropriate coding, payment and coverage policies for our products and procedures using our products. This team focuses both on payer engagement as well as providing support to the providers.
Coverage and reimbursement by governmental and third-party payors may depend upon a number of factors, including the determination that the product or service and its use or administration for a particular patient is:
•a covered benefit;
•safe, effective and medically necessary;
•appropriate for the specific patient;
•supported by guidelines established by the relevant professional societies;
•cost-effective; and
•neither experimental nor investigational.
Third-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular products. In addition, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for procedures exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for procedures can differ significantly from payor to payor. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement can be a time-consuming process that could require supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data.
Payors continually review new and existing technologies for possible coverage and can, without notice, deny or reverse coverage for new or existing products and procedures. Further, future coverage and reimbursement may be subject to increased restrictions, such as additional prior authorization requirements, both in the United States and in international markets. In addition, Medicare Administrative Contractors could issue a local coverage determination decision that could restrict the patients eligible for a treatment with our products. Third-party coverage and reimbursement may not be available or adequate in either the United States or international markets. Further, other BPH treatments may be more widely covered or subject to different co-pay policies and requirements, which could impact demand for our products.
Coding and Payment
Third-party payors require physicians and hospitals to identify the service for which they are seeking reimbursement by using Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes, which are created and maintained by the American Medical Association, or AMA. The surgical treatment of BPH using Aquablation therapy is described by CPT code 0421T, which is 
the code describing transurethral waterjet ablation of the prostate, a Category III code published by the AMA in January 2017. In February 2021, the AMA approved an extension for CPT code 0421T through December 31, 2026.  
Physician reimbursement under Medicare generally is based on a defined fee schedule, the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, through which payment amounts are determined by the relative values of the professional service rendered. Physician payment rates for Category III codes are determined by the MACs and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The payment to the surgeon using CPT code 0421T is currently similar to that for a TURP procedure.
In addition to payment to the surgeon for professional services, Medicare provides reimbursement to our hospital customers for procedures under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system, or HOPPS, and inpatient prospective payment system, or IPPS. The HOPPS and IPPS provide bundled amounts generally intended to reimburse the hospital for all facility costs related to procedures performed in the hospital outpatient setting and inpatient setting, respectively. Medicare also provides reimbursement for procedures performed in ASCs. Reimbursement rates from commercial payors vary depending on the commercial payor, contract terms, and other factors.
As part of the 2020 Outpatient Prospective Payment System ruling, the CMS granted approval for a transitional pass-through, or TPT, payment for Aquablation therapy. TPT status is intended to encourage the use of newly FDA-approved medical devices, drugs, and biologics across all fields of medicine and to boost Medicare patients’ access to these innovative therapies by temporarily paying more than established facility fees. The TPT payment for Aquablation therapy is effective through December 31, 2022.
Commercial Payor and Government Program Coverage
A core pillar of our reimbursement strategy involves broadening our third-party payor coverage. We continue to have active discussions with commercial payors to establish positive national coverage policies by highlighting our compelling and robust clinical data, increased patient demand and support from leading medical societies and key opinion leaders.  
As of December 27, 2020, all MACs cover procedures involving Aquablation therapy are covered for Medicare patients. We believe Medicare accounts for approximately 50% of all hospital-based resective BPH procedures performed in the United States.  
Prior Authorization Approval Process
Our reimbursement strategy includes leveraging our market access team as advisors when needed to support in obtaining appropriate prior authorization approvals in advance of treatment. We believe we are highly effective in providing guidance to obtain prior authorizations when needed.
Reimbursement Outside of the United States
Outside of the United States, reimbursement levels vary significantly by country, and within some countries by region, as well as by payor type. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government sponsors, hospital budgets or private health insurance plans, or combinations thereof. Obtaining reimbursement is a key part of our market development strategy outside of the United States. We currently have established reimbursement in Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy are continuing to establish new, as well as more favorable, reimbursement. 
Research and Development
We have established a dedicated research and development team with strong capabilities in surgical robotics and imaging-enabled surgery as well as integrating hardware and software to create an exceptional user and patient experience. We believe our focus on this experience will allow us to continue to bring new upgrades, capabilities and products to market, allowing us to innovate and maintain our competitive positioning. 
To improve customer experience, we are continually innovating our technologies to support and improve Aquablation therapy to further satisfy the evolving needs of surgeons and their patients as well as to further enhance the usability and scalability of the AquaBeam Robotic System. We also plan to leverage our treatment data and software development capabilities to enable artificial intelligence assisted anatomy recognition and improved treatment planning and personalization. In the future, we may evaluate the application of the AquaBeam Robotic System in new urologic conditions beyond BPH.
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our research, development and clinical expenses were $19.0 million and $16.3 million, respectively.
Manufacturing and Supply
We directly manufacture the AquaBeam Robotic System, the handpiece and other accessories at our facility in Redwood City, California. This includes supporting the supply chain distribution and logistics of the various components. Components, sub-assemblies and services required to manufacture our products are purchased from numerous global suppliers. Each AquaBeam Robotic System is shipped to our customers with a third-party manufactured ultrasound system and probes. We utilize a well-known third-party logistics provider located in United States and the Netherlands to ship our products to our customers globally. While we do not believe we are substantially dependent on any suppliers, currently our principal suppliers include Shantou Institute of Ultrasonic Instruments Co. Ltd. (which manufactures our transrectal ultrasound set), Myriad Fiber Imaging Tech., Inc. (which manufactures our integrated scope), HydroCision, Inc. (which manufactures our pump cartridge contract), and Medical Targeting Technologies GmbH (which manufactures our articulating arms). Our suppliers manufacture the components they produce for us and test our components and devices to our specifications. We have entered into manufacturing and supply agreements with several of our single-source suppliers pursuant to which they supply the components we need. In addition, we intend to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to enable us to continue our operations while we obtain another supplier in the event that one or more of our single-source suppliers were to encounter a delay in supply or end supply. 
Competition
The industry in which we operate is subject to rapid change from the introduction of new products and technologies and other activities of industry participants. While we believe Aquablation therapy and the AquaBeam Robotic System provide us with a competitive advantage against other competing BPH treatment modalities, our currently marketed products are, and any future products we commercialize will be, subject to intense competition.
Certain of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, regulatory approval, promotion, sale and support of their products. Our competitors may also have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we do, including relationships with our potential customers. In addition, many of these companies have longer operating histories and greater brand recognition than we do. Additionally, many of these companies have overcome reimbursement barriers and their procedures are covered by nearly all major insurance carriers. Because of the size of the BPH market, we anticipate that companies will dedicate significant resources to developing competing products.
We consider our primary competition to be resective surgical treatments. These include among others, those manufacturers producing devices for the TURP procedure and laser-based therapies marketed by Boston Scientific Corporation. We also believe we will eventually compete with non-resective and non-surgical treatments. The non-resective treatments include, among others, UroLift marketed by Teleflex Incorporated and Rezum marketed by Boston Scientific Corporation. Non-surgical treatments for BPH are primarily pharmaceuticals. The primary pharmaceutical products marketed to treat BPH include Flomax marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim, Rapaflow marketed by Allergan plc, Avodart marketed by GlaxoSmithKline plc, and Proscar marketed by Merck & Co., Inc. 
We believe that the primary basis on which we compete include:
•improved outcomes for patients;
•product safety, efficacy, reliability and durability;
•quality and volume of clinical data;
•effective marketing to and education of patients, physicians and hospitals;
•company, product and brand recognition;
•sales force experience and access;
•product support and service;
•technological innovation, product enhancements and speed of innovation;
•pricing and revenue strategies;
•effectiveness of reimbursement teams and strategies
•regulatory status and speed to market; and
•dedicated clinical representatives.
We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors in regard to any one or all of these factors.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. 
As of December 31, 2021, we had rights to 32 issued U.S. patents, expiring between 2028 and 2040, 80 issued foreign patents, expiring between 2028 and 2037, 35 pending U.S. patent applications, four pending PCT applications, and 52 foreign patent applications. 
As of December 31, 2021, our rights to foreign issued patents include 12 granted Chinese patents, 19 granted Japanese patents and nine granted European patents, of which nine have been validated in Germany, eight in Spain, nine in France, nine in the United Kingdom, five in Ireland, and eight in Italy. As of December 31, 2021, our rights to foreign patent applications include 15 pending European applications, 11 pending Chinese applications, 11 pending Japanese applications, eight pending Brazilian applications, and seven pending Indian applications.
As of December 31, 2021, we have the rights to issued patents and pending patent applications directed to our current AquaBeam Robotic System, including 13 issued U.S. patents and 33 foreign issued or granted patents. The 13 issued U.S. patents, expiring between 2028 and 2038, include machine and process claims, with nine issued patents directed to the handpiece and four issued patents directed to the system. The 33 foreign issued patents, expiring between 2028 and 2035, include machine claims, with 22 issued patents directed to the handpiece and 11 issued patents directed to the system. The 33 foreign issued patents include one Brazilian patent, four Chinese patents, seven Japanese patents, four German patents, three Spanish patents, four French patents, four United Kingdom patents, three Irish patents and three Italian patents. The remaining 19 of the 32 issued U.S. patents and the remaining 47 of the 80 foreign issued patents have machine and process claims directed to prostate treatments with laser energy, enucleation of the prostate, radiation therapy, cell sampling and hemostasis.
There is no active patent litigation involving any of our patents and we have not received any notices of patent infringement
As of December 31, 2021, we had 36 pending and registered trademark filings worldwide, some of which may provide trademark protection in multiple countries.
We also rely, in part, upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation, and may in the future rely upon licensing opportunities, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality and assignment agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to our proprietary information.
Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and we cannot assure you that any current or subsequently issued patents will protect our intellectual property rights or provide us with any competitive advantage. While there is no active litigation involving any of our patents or other intellectual property rights and we have not received any notices of patent infringement, we may be required to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights against third parties in the future. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property Matters” for additional information regarding these and other risks related to our intellectual property portfolio and their potential effect on us.
License Agreement with AquaBeam
In 2008, we assigned to AquaBeam LLC, or AquaBeam, certain provisional patent applications, or AquaBeam Patent Applications, which have since issued as patents, and any future patent applications that claim priority to the AquaBeam Patent Applications, or AquaBeam Patents. 
In September 2019, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement, or the AquaBeam License Agreement, with AquaBeam. Pursuant to the AquaBeam License Agreement, AquaBeam granted us a worldwide, exclusive (even as to AquaBeam), sublicensable, royalty-free license under the AquaBeam Patents and to all other patent rights owned by AquaBeam, that claim certain technology related to delivering energy to tissues by directing a liquid fluid stream, or together with AquaBeam Patents, Licensed Patents, in the field of urology, or Field. Pursuant to the AquaBeam License 
Agreement, and subject to the terms therein, we granted AquaBeam a worldwide, exclusive (even as to us), sublicensable, royalty-free license under certain of our patents rights, that claim certain technology related to delivering energy to tissues by directing a liquid fluid stream, or PROCEPT Patents, outside the Field. No payments (except for patent prosecution and maintenance costs) have been made or are otherwise required under the AquaBeam License Agreement.
The AquaBeam License Agreement will remain in full force and effect on a country-by-country basis until the last to expire of the Licensed Patents and the PROCEPT Patents in such country. The expiration date of the last-to-expire of the Licensed Patents and PROCEPT Patents will not be earlier than 2037. The AquaBeam License Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of uncured material breach by the other party that remains uncured for 90 days (or 30 days for payment related breaches), or bankruptcy of the other party.
Government Regulation
Our products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities in the EEA. Our products are subject to regulation as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
In addition to U.S. regulations, we are subject to a variety of regulations in the EEA governing clinical trials and the commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we have or are required to obtain FDA clearance or approval for a product, we will be required to obtain authorization before commencing clinical trials and to obtain marketing authorization or approval of our products under the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States before we can commence clinical trials or commercialize our products in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or PMA approval. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to either a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or another commercially available device that was cleared to through the 510(k) process.
Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed.
De Novo Classification
Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the 
absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure.
This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) pre-market notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) pre-market notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo request. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the de novo request if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
Our currently marketed AquaBeam Robotic System is a Class II device, which was initially granted marketing authorization pursuant to a de novo classification. We have subsequently received FDA clearance of a 510(k) pre-market notification for modifications to the AquaBeam Robotic System where we used the initially authorized device as the predicate device for our more recent 510(k) clearance.
PMA Approval Pathway
Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a preapproval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR.
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA or de novo request and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
Regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device, clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may impose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
Post-Market Regulation
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; 
•QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information; 
•clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of a supplement for certain modifications to PMA devices; 
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; 
•correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; 
•complying with the new federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers, or UDI, on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database; 
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and 
•post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
Manufacturing processes for medical devices are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR or other applicable regulatory requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
•recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products; 
•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
•refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products; 
•withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; 
•refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or 
•criminal prosecution.
Regulation of Medical Devices in the EEA
There is currently no premarket government of medical devices in the EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland). However, all medical devices placed on the market in the EEA must meet the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I of Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices, or the Medical Devices Directive, and the regulations laid down in the 2017/745, or the Medical Device Regulations. There is also a directive specifically addressing Active Implantable Medical Devices (Directive 90/385/EEC). The most fundamental essential requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment, and product 
standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter. Compliance with a standard developed to implement an essential requirement also creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement.
To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body. Notified bodies are often separate entities and are authorized or licensed to perform such assessments by government authorities. The notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE Mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EEA. Once the product has been placed on the market in the EEA, the manufacturer must comply with requirements for reporting incidents and field safety corrective actions associated with the medical device.
In order to demonstrate safety and efficacy for their medical devices, manufacturers must conduct clinical investigations in accordance with the requirements of Annex X to the Medical Devices Directive, Annex 7 of the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive, and applicable European and International Organization for Standardization standards, as implemented or adopted in the EEA member states. Clinical trials for medical devices usually require the approval of an ethics review board and approval by or notification to the national regulatory authorities. Both regulators and ethics committees also require the submission of serious adverse event reports during a study and may request a copy of the final study report.
On May 25, 2017 the new Medical Devices Regulation, or 2017/745 or MDR, was adopted by the European Parliament, which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Following its entry into application on May 26, 2021, the MDR will introduce substantial changes to the obligations with which medical device manufacturers must comply in the EU. High risk medical devices will be subject to additional scrutiny during the conformity assessment procedure. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member states, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member state laws implementing them, in all EEA member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation.
On the effective date, May 26, 2021, the new regulations will among other things:
•strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available; 
•establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market; 
•improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; 
•set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; 
•strengthened rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
We are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may sell our products, including in the areas of:
•design, development, manufacturing and testing; 
•product standards; 
•product safety; 
•product safety reporting; 
•marketing, sales and distribution;
•packaging and storage requirements; 
•labeling requirements; 
•content and language of instructions for use; 
•clinical trials; 
•record keeping procedures; 
•advertising and promotion; 
•recalls and field corrective actions; 
•post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury; 
•import and export restrictions; 
•tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements; 
•registration for reimbursement; and 
•necessity of testing performed in country by distributors for licensees.
The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
We expect this revised regulation to include further controls and requirements on the following activities:
•high level of request for premarket clinical evidence for high risk devices; 
•increased scrutiny of technical files for implantable devices; 
•monitoring of notified bodies, by independent auditors; 
•increased requirements regarding vigilance and product traceability (specifically related to labeling requirements); and 
•increased regulation for non-traditional roles such as importer and distributor.
Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse and Physician Payment Transparency Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, foreign, federal, and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including stock, stock options, and the compensation derived through ownership interests.
Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Our arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other persons or entities who are in a position to refer may not fully meet the stringent criteria specified in the various safe 
harbors. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in significant civil monetary penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including significant criminal fines and imprisonment, as well as exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Liability under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may also arise because of the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business. Conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy one of these safe harbor provisions may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply more broadly to items or services covered by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers and self-pay patients.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. In addition, private parties may initiate “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the federal civil False Claims Act in the name of the government and share in the proceeds of any monetary recovery. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Penalties for federal civil False Claim Act violations include penalties for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and, most critically, may provide the basis for exclusion from the federally funded healthcare program. There are also criminal penalties for making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious or fraudulent.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Many foreign countries have similar laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. Foreign laws and regulations may vary greatly from country to country. For example, the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to EU Directives concerning misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased foreign, federal, and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the CMS, information related to payments or and other “transfers of value” made to physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse-midwives) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and payments or other “transfers of value” to such physician owners. Certain foreign countries and U.S. states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities.
Healthcare Reform Measures
In the United States, there have been, and may continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that would result in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services.
By way of example, in the United States, the ACA was enacted in March 2010 and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts our industry. The ACA contained a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures, all of which have impacted existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that states and individuals lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA’s individual mandate, post-repeal of its associated tax penalty. Additionally, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, and in connection with subsequent legislation, reduced Medicare payments to providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 and a 1% reduction from April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover Medicare overpayments to providers from three to five years. The current presidential administration and Congress may continue to pursue significant changes to the current healthcare laws.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. For example, HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses and their respective business associates and covered subcontractors that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. 
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Laws
Our U.S. operations are subject to the FCPA. We are required to comply with the FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their employees, agents and intermediaries from engaging in bribery or authorizing, promising, providing, or offering, directly or indirectly, anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which requires such companies to maintain complete and accurate books and records and maintain a system of internal accounting controls. We also are subject to similar anticorruption laws and 
regulations implementing the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.
Facilities
Our principal office is located at 900 Island Drive, Redwood City, California, where we lease approximately 43,485 square feet of office space. We lease this space under a lease that terminates on October 29, 2023. On December 31, 2021, we entered into a lease agreement for two existing buildings, comprising approximately 158,221 square feet of space, in San Jose, California. The term of the lease is anticipated to commence no later than December 31, 2022, and continue for 122 months following the lease commencement, with two five year options to extend the term of the lease. This facility is expected to support our expected growth in headcount and production volume.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
We employ a growing and skilled employee base across all functions focused on attaining our vision of becoming the treatment of choice in all prostates and united by our shared values. As of December 31, 2021, we had 234 employees.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, engaging, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. Our recruiting practices and decisions on whom to hire are among our most important activities and we strive to recruit a diverse team of people who align with our values. Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with PROCEPT BioRobotics’ performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. Our team strives to develop and implement compensation and benefits policies and programs that are grounded in the competitive market, support our business objectives and pay for performance, whilst managing for fiscal responsibility. We provide our employees with competitive fixed and variable pay, company equity programs, access to health and life insurance benefits, disability coverage, 401(k) program, employee stock purchase plan, paid time off and numerous well-being benefits. Our equity incentive plans are designed to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based awards which create ownership and participation in our value creation. In order to assess and improve employee retention and engagement, we survey employees frequently with the assistance of third-party consultants and take actions to address areas of employee concern.
Due to the essential nature of our business, we have continued operating during the COVID-19 pandemic and health and safety of our employees is a key focus. In response to the pandemic, we have established safety protocols and work from home flexibility where possible to protect our employees. Employees that work on site are required to adhere to protocols following guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control or mandated by local regulations. We regularly communicate regarding safety protocols, potential exposures and changes that are made based on the COVID-19 transmission rate.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of management, would have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity and reputation harm, and other factors.
