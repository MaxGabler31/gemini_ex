Item 1. Business.

As used in this report, the terms “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to Century Casinos, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole, unless the context otherwise requires.

This report includes amounts translated into US dollars from certain foreign currencies. For a description of the currency conversion methodology and exchange rates used for certain transactions, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.

Overview
Century Casinos, Inc., a Delaware corporation founded in 1992, is a casino entertainment company that develops and operates gaming establishments as well as related lodging, restaurant, horse racing (including off-track betting) and entertainment facilities primarily in North America. Our main goal is to grow our business by actively pursuing the development or acquisition of new gaming opportunities and growing and reinvesting in our existing operations.

We began operating land-based casinos in 1996 with the acquisition of our casino in Cripple Creek, Colorado. In 2006, we opened casinos in Central City, Colorado and Alberta, Canada. Between 2015 and 2019, we acquired an additional casino and developed two Racing and Entertainment Centers (“RECs”) in Alberta, Canada. In 2013, we increased our ownership in Casinos Poland, Ltd., the owner and operator of eight casinos throughout Poland, to a majority 66.6% ownership interest. In December 2019, we completed our largest acquisition to date, adding three properties to our United States (“US”) portfolio, two in Missouri and one in West Virginia (the “2019 Acquisition”).

2021 Business Developments
In December 2020, we temporarily closed our Canadian casinos and RECs and our Poland casinos to comply with quarantines issued by the Alberta and Polish governments to contain the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus (“COVID-19”). Our Poland casinos reopened February 12, 2021 but closed again on March 20, 2021. Our Poland casinos reopened on May 28, 2021 and our Canadian casinos reopened on June 10, 2021. Our casinos in the United States reopened in June 2020 and remained open throughout 2021.

As discussed further in this report, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our results of operations during 2021, but to a lesser extent than in 2020 because our United States properties were open and operating throughout 2021. The duration and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to remain uncertain.

In April 2021, our casino in West Virginia together with a gaming partner launched an internet and mobile interactive gaming app. The agreement provides for a share of net gaming revenue. 

‎


In November 2020, Colorado voters passed a constitutional amendment to allow voters in Cripple Creek, Black Hawk and Central City to increase or remove betting limits and approve new casino games. Elected officials in all three cities approved no limits on single bets at the casinos, and unlimited betting and new games began in May 2021. 

We have partnered with sports betting operators that will conduct sports wagering under each of the three Colorado master licenses for sports wagering held by our Colorado subsidiaries. Sports wagering in Colorado became legal on May 1, 2020. One of these mobile sports betting apps launched in July 2020 and a second launched in August 2021. The third sports betting app is expected to launch in mid-2022. Each agreement with the sports betting operators provides for a share of net gaming revenue and a minimum revenue guarantee each year.

In July 2021, we announced that we had purchased land and a small two-story hotel near our Century Casino Caruthersville property with plans to refurbish the existing hotel’s 36 rooms by mid-2022. 

In July 2021, the Missouri law requiring each casino to be a floating facility was amended to allow casino facilities to be built as a standard building with a container with at least 2,000 gallons of water beneath the facility. In July 2021, we announced that we were working to develop a new casino and hotel facility in Caruthersville that would include moving our riverboat casino to a non-floating facility. In December 2021, a lawsuit was filed by the City of St. Louis to block implementation of the omnibus bill that included the amendment to the definition of a floating facility. As a result, our Caruthersville project is delayed pending a resolution of the lawsuit or passage of a stand-alone bill amending the definition of a floating facility.

Operations
We view each jurisdiction in which our casinos are located as separate operating segments and each casino within those jurisdictions as reportable units. Except as described below, we aggregate our operating segments into three reportable segments based on the geographical locations in which our casinos operate. We have additional business activities, including our concession agreements and certain other corporate and management operations, that we report as Corporate and Other. The following are our reportable segments:
United States
Canada

Corporate and Other
Cruise Ships. We have a concession agreement with TUI Cruises to operate two ship-based casinos. From March 2020 to June 2021, neither casino operated due to COVID-19. Only one ship-based casino is currently operating. Our agreement to operate that ship-based casino ends in the second quarter of 2022, and our agreement to operate the other ship-based casino ends in the second quarter of 2023. In May 2021, a concession agreement with TUI Cruises for two other ship-based casinos ended. 
Additional Projects and Other Developments
Nugget Casino Resort in Sparks, Nevada
On February 22, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement with Marnell Gaming, LLC (“Marnell”), pursuant to which a newly formed subsidiary of the Company will purchase from Marnell (i) 50% of the membership interests in Smooth Bourbon, LLC (“PropCo”), and (ii) 100% of the membership interests in Nugget Sparks, LLC (“OpCo”). OpCo owns and operates the Nugget Casino Resort in Sparks, Nevada, and PropCo owns the real property on which the casino is located. At the First Closing (as defined below), PropCo will enter into a lease with OpCo for an annual rent of $15.0 million.

We will purchase 50% of the membership interests in PropCo for approximately $95.0 million (subject to certain adjustments) at the first closing, which is expected to occur early in the second quarter of 2022 (the “First Closing”). Subject to approval from the Nevada Gaming Commission, our purchase of 100% of the membership interests in OpCo for approximately $100.0 million (subject to certain adjustments) is expected to close within one year after the First Closing (the “Second Closing”). Following the Second Closing, we will own the operating assets of Nugget Casino Resort and 50% of the membership interests in PropCo (the “Nugget Acquisition”). We also will have a five-year option to acquire the remaining 50% of the membership interests in PropCo for $105 million plus 2% per annum.

Caruthersville Hotel
On July 16, 2021, we announced that we had purchased land and a small two-story hotel near Century Casino Caruthersville with plans to refurbish the existing hotel’s 36 rooms by mid-2022. We estimate the cost of the remodel to be $3.6 million. As of December 31, 2021, we have spent $0.6 million on this project.
Missouri
We plan to build hotels at our Cape Girardeau and Caruthersville locations. The hotel at Cape Girardeau is planned as a seven-story building with 76,000 square feet. The hotel will have scenic views of Cape Girardeau and the Mississippi River including the iconic Bill Emerson Memorial bridge. The hotel lobby will be directly connected to the casino entrance as well as the property’s entertainment center and will also provide direct access to Beacon 53, the newly renovated premier lounge and bar, which is one of very few venues in the region with Mississippi River views. With the hotel development, CCG will transform to a full resort destination providing ample reasons for individual and group multi-day visits for many different purposes such as gaming, dining, conferences, concerts, events and more. The City of Cape Girardeau approved the plan in February 2022. Additional state and local approvals from other agencies will also be required. Construction is expected to start in the summer of 2022 with completion expected in late 2023.

In addition, we plan to move our Century Casino Caruthersville casino from the riverboat to a new land-based casino. In July 2021, the Missouri law requiring each casino to be a floating facility was amended to allow casino facilities to be built as a standard building with a container with at least 2,000 gallons of water beneath the facility. The City of St. Louis has filed a lawsuit to block the implementation of the omnibus bill that included the amendment to the definition of a floating facility. As a result, the portion of the project in Caruthersville is delayed pending a resolution of the lawsuit, passage of a stand-alone bill amending the definition of a floating facility or adjustments to our current plans.

The new land-based casino at Century Casino Caruthersville will be located on the protected side of the Caruthersville floodwall. It is adjacent to the property’s existing Pavilion building, which will feature the hotel lobby, a restaurant, a bar, a lounge, multi-purpose meeting rooms and offices. The gaming spaces will initially offer 650 slot machines, table games, a restaurant and a bar. In addition, the new casino will also have the possibility of an expansion for up to an additional 140 slot machines. The 38-room hotel, which will be located between the Pavilion and the new casino, will provide scenic views of the Mississippi River and Caruthersville. Construction will not impact parking or access to the riverboat casino, as the development will take place on the opposite side of the floodwall. The new casino and hotel will transform CCV to an attractive, conveniently accessible and smartly sized entertainment destination, which we believe comports with the vision and development plans of the City of Caruthersville. The Missouri Gaming Commission gave preliminary approval for the casino project on December 1, 2021. Additional state and local approvals will be required, including the final regulatory approval from the Missouri Gaming Commission once the new casino construction project is completed. Pending resolution of the City of St. Louis lawsuit, construction is expected to start in the summer of 2022 with completion expected in mid-2024. 

We estimate the cost of the projects to be $73.0 million. As of December 31, 2021, we have spent $1.0 million on these projects. We plan to finance the cost of the projects with cash on hand, financing or a combination of the two.

 


Additional Projects
We currently are exploring additional potential gaming projects and acquisition opportunities. Along with the capital needs of potential projects or acquisitions, there are various other risks which, if they materialize, could affect our ability to complete a proposed project or acquisition or could eliminate its feasibility altogether. For more information on these and other risks related to our business, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” below. 
Terminated Projects
Mendoza Central Entretenimientos S.A. (“MCE”). In November 2021, our subsidiary CRM sold its ownership of 7.5% of MCE for nominal consideration. In addition, the consulting services agreement between CRM and MCE, under which CRM provided advice on casino matters and received a service fee from MCE, has been terminated. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report for additional information about MCE.
Capital Needs, Uses and Cash Flow
As a gaming company, our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our casinos and customer spending. Most of our revenue is essentially cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. Our industry is capital intensive, and we rely heavily on the ability of our casinos to generate operating cash flow to maintain operations, fund reinvestment in existing properties for both refurbishment and expansion projects, repay third party debt, and pursue additional growth via new development and acquisition opportunities. When necessary and available, we supplement the cash flows generated by our operations with either cash on hand or funds provided by bank borrowings or other debt or equity financing.
Marketing and Competition
We face intense competition from other casinos within the jurisdictions in which we operate. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater name recognition and financial and marketing resources than we do. We seek to compete through promotion of our players’ clubs, enhancement of social networking initiatives and other marketing efforts. In addition to our players’ clubs, we also have various cash and prize promotions and market our casinos through a variety of media outlets including internet, television, radio, print and billboard advertising. Our marketing focuses on competition and other facts and circumstances of each market area in which we operate. Our primary marketing strategy centers on attracting new customers and rewarding repeat customers through our players’ club programs. All visitors to our properties are offered the opportunity to join our players’ club. We maintain a proprietary database that consists primarily of slot machine customers that allows us to create effective targeted marketing and promotional programs, cash and merchandise giveaways, coupons, downloadable promotional credits, preferred parking, food, lodging, game tournaments and other special events. In the United States, our players’ club cards allow us to update our database and track member gaming preferences, including, but not limited to, maximum, minimum, and total amounts wagered and frequency of visits. We have designed reward programs based on total amount wagered and frequency of visits to reward customer loyalty and attract new customers to our properties. Those who qualify for VIP status receive additional benefits compared to regular club membership, such as invitations to exclusive VIP events. 
United States
Colorado – Cripple Creek, Central City and Black Hawk are the only three cities in Colorado that allow gaming, exclusive of two Native American gaming operations in southwestern Colorado, and are located in historic mining towns dating back to the late 1800’s that have developed into tourist attractions. The casino operations in Black Hawk constitute a significant portion of the overall casino gaming market in Colorado (exclusive of the Native American gaming operations), with 59% of the total gaming devices in Colorado and approximately 76% of total gaming revenue in Colorado in 2021. Central City and Black Hawk are located approximately one mile apart and compete with one another for market share. As a result, we view the two cities as one combined market servicing the Denver area. Black Hawk, which we believe does not maintain the same rigorous historical preservation standards as Central City, has been able to successfully attract major casino industry leaders with the ability to offer larger hotels, upscale dining facilities, performance centers and spa facilities. No limit single bets at casinos and new casino games were approved and began on May 1, 2021. Some of our competitors may offer larger betting limits or certain games not offered by us, which could attract customers to those competitors. Sports wagering in Colorado became legal in May 2020. We have partnered with sports betting operators that are conducting or will conduct sports wagering under each of the three Colorado master licenses for sports wagering held by our Colorado subsidiaries. 

Our marketing objective for the casinos in Colorado is to create public awareness by positioning our casinos as the premier provider of personal service, convenient parking, the latest gaming products and superior food. In addition to our players’ clubs, we also have various cash and prize promotions and market our casinos through a variety of channels including radio, billboard, print and social media. Cripple Creek currently has 12 casinos operating, and there are currently six and 15 casinos operating in Central City and Black Hawk, respectively. There are competitors in each city that offer covered parking and more hotel rooms, which may negatively impact our Colorado casinos, particularly during inclement weather and the peak tourist season. In Cripple Creek, a casino across the street from ours is undergoing an expansion, which could have a negative effect on CRC.

 


West Virginia – Mountaineer is located on the Ohio River bank at the northern tip of West Virginia’s northwestern panhandle approximately 30 miles from the Pittsburgh International Airport and a one hour drive from downtown Pittsburgh. Mountaineer has four competitors within 50 miles; two in Pennsylvania, one in West Virginia and one in Ohio. Mountaineer primarily attracts customers from neighboring Ohio and from the greater Pittsburgh area. We market this casino as a destination for year-round entertainment. Mountaineer also hosts the annual West Virginia Derby horse racing event.

Missouri – Cape Girardeau and Caruthersville have competitors in Missouri, Arkansas and Illinois. The distance between our Cape Girardeau and Caruthersville properties is 85 miles. While our two properties share a small portion of our customer database, we do not believe that our properties compete against one another for customers. We market our casinos as the premier providers of personal service. In addition to our players’ clubs, our casinos motivate customers by offering various cash and prize promotions, point incentives, and tournaments in addition to other incentives. Our casinos are marketed through a variety of channels including but not limited to radio, billboard, print and social media. Cape Girardeau includes an event center and draws customers mostly from within a 50-mile radius from the property. The closest competitor to Cape Girardeau is located 60 miles away in Illinois. A potential casino in southern Illinois approximately 56 miles from Cape Girardeau, which we expect to open in 2023, could increase competition at our Cape Girardeau casino. Caruthersville includes a 40,000 square foot pavilion and a 27-space RV park. The majority of Caruthersville’s customers reside in Tennessee. The closest competitor to Caruthersville, with the exception of our Cape Girardeau casino, is located in Arkansas and is 90 miles away. A casino expansion at that location in Arkansas, which we expect to be completed in mid-2022, could increase competition with our Caruthersville casino. In addition, there is a proposal to build a casino near Lake Ozark, which requires approval by the US Department of the Interior; however, that project is not expected to directly compete with our casinos as it is over 200 miles from our properties. We believe that our expansion projects at both Missouri locations will allow us to compete for individuals or groups that desire a multi-day visit to Cape Girardeau or Caruthersville. 

Canada
Edmonton – CRA, St. Albert and Century Mile have five competitors, all casinos, in the Edmonton market. The distance between CRA and CSA is approximately 13 miles, and CMR is approximately 30 miles from each of CRA and CSA. We do not believe that our properties compete against one another for customers. Our main marketing activities for these properties focus on casino branding, promoting the racetrack, the player’s club program and promotions made through various marketing channels such as print, television, billboard, mail and social media. CRA is one of two casinos in the city of Edmonton that have both a hotel and showrooms. The property’s showrooms allow us to attract customers to the casino through live music concerts, private concerts, comedic performances, catering and banquet events. In addition, the property is the only casino in the Edmonton market to offer a heated and complimentary parking garage. CRA’s closest competitor is located approximately five miles away. St. Albert includes a small concert and event venue. St. Albert’s closest competitor is located approximately five miles away. Century Mile is the only REC in the Edmonton area. Unique to this property is an 8.0 furlong (1.0 mile) horse racetrack. Century Mile’s closest competitor is located approximately 17 miles away. In January 2022, the Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis Commission (“AGLC”) removed its moratorium on approving additional gaming facilities. Additional gaming facilities under consideration will be subject to market analysis done by the AGLC and, if approved by the AGLC, could increase competition with our properties.

Calgary - Century Downs has seven competitors (two of which have a combination of hotel and casino) in the Calgary market. Unique to this property is a 5.5 furlong (0.7 mile) horse racetrack. Our casino is one of two casinos in the market with an off-track betting parlor. Using numerous forms of media, such as radio, television and billboards, we concentrate our marketing on the casino floor, the players’ club and racetrack. This property is located one mile north of the city limits of Calgary, one mile from the CrossIron Mills Mall and 4.5 miles from the Calgary International Airport with the closest competition located approximately 13 miles away. The AGLC has approved the relocation of one of our competitors to be approximately 8 miles from Century Downs, which we expect to occur in late 2022 and could increase competition at Century Downs. In addition, due to the AGLC’s recent removal of its moratorium on approving additional gaming facilities, new gaming facilities may be approved by the AGLC, which could increase competition with our properties.

Pari-mutuel networks – Century Mile is the exclusive operator of the Alberta pari-mutuel network. In addition to permitting customers to place wagers at off-track betting locations, the network offers advance deposit wagering for online wagering. 

Loyalty program – Our casinos in Alberta participate in the Winner’s Edge, an Alberta-wide casino loyalty program implemented by the AGLC. Players who sign up for the program can earn points that can be redeemed for free play, take part in monthly contests and receive discounts on food in casino restaurants. Our casinos offer Winner’s Edge in addition to our own loyalty program. 

Online gaming – The AGLC launched an online gaming website, “Play Alberta”, in October 2020. The website competes primarily with unregulated online gaming websites that are currently available to Alberta residents. We have not experienced a negative impact to our results of operations in Canada from online gaming; however, increased competition from online gaming could occur and adversely affect our results of operations in Alberta in the future. 



Poland
There are 52 casino licenses available throughout Poland. The Polish government generally forbids the marketing of gaming activities outside of a casino, but the marketing of entertainment is permissible. CPL relies on the locations of its casinos, which are primarily in hotels in major cities throughout Poland, to attract customers. The Polish government issues casino licenses in Poland by district, and there are additional casinos in each district in which CPL operates. For example, five other casinos in the Warsaw district compete with our three casinos operating in Warsaw. The Polish Minister of Finance does not disclose individual casino data. Poland also has slot arcades and online gaming that operate through a state-run company. We have not experienced a negative impact to our results of operations in Poland from slot arcades or online gaming; however, increased competition from slot arcades that are located in the cities in which our casinos are located as well as online gaming could occur and adversely affect our results of operations in the future. 
Seasonality 
United States – Our casinos in Colorado attract more customers during the warmer months from May through September. We expect to attract fewer customers from October through April because weather conditions during this period are variable and can have a significant impact on daily business levels. In West Virginia, we attract more customers from March to August during the racing season. Our casinos in Missouri attract customers throughout the year with the highest business volumes in February and March. 

Canada – Our Edmonton and Calgary casinos in Alberta, Canada attract more customers from September through April. During the remainder of the year, the casinos attract fewer customers because we compete with outdoor activities. Century Downs and Century Mile also attract additional customers during the racing season from March through November. Our off-track betting parlors attract more customers during the peak racing season from May through August.

Poland – CPL generally attracts more customers from October through March because domestic customers generally vacation during the summer months. 

Governmental Regulation and Licensing
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state, local, foreign, provincial or federal regulations. We are required to obtain and maintain gaming licenses in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct gaming operations. The limitation, conditioning, suspension, revocation or non-renewal of gaming licenses, or the failure to reauthorize gaming in certain jurisdictions, would materially adversely affect our gaming operations in that jurisdiction. In addition, changes in laws that restrict, prohibit or permit gaming operations in any jurisdiction, including the recent removal of the AGLC’s moratorium on approving additional gaming facilities, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Statutes and regulations can require us to meet various standards relating to, among other matters, business licenses, registration of employees, floor plans, background investigations of licensees and employees, historic preservation, building, fire and accessibility requirements, payment of gaming taxes, and regulations concerning equipment, machines, chips, gaming participants, and ownership interests. Civil and criminal penalties, including shutdowns or the loss of our ability to operate gaming facilities in a particular jurisdiction, can be assessed against us and/or our officers to the extent of their individual participation in, or association with, a violation of any of the state or local gaming statutes or regulations. Such laws and regulations apply in all jurisdictions in which we may do business. Management believes that we are in compliance with all applicable gaming and non-gaming regulations. A detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Other Regulations
We are subject to certain foreign, federal, state, provincial and local safety and health, employment and environmental laws, regulations and ordinances that apply to our non-gaming operations. We have not made, and do not anticipate making, material expenditures with respect to these laws, regulations and ordinances. However, the coverage of, and attendant compliance costs associated with, such laws, regulations and ordinances may result in future additional costs to our operations.

Rules and regulations regarding the service of alcoholic beverages are strict. The loss or suspension of a liquor license could significantly impair our operations. Local building, parking and fire codes and similar regulations also could impact our operations and any proposed development of our properties.

We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Any violations of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our business.

‎


Employees and Human Capital
Employees – As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2,287 full-time employees and 439 part-time employees. During busier months, a casino may supplement its permanent staff with seasonal employees. We reduced our staffing during 2020 and 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic closures and related issues, and our staffing levels in the United States and Canada are approximately 83% of pre-COVID-19 levels. Although we have open positions throughout North America and have experienced staffing shortages at our West Virginia property, we do not anticipate returning to a pre-COVID workforce level due to a combination of increased efficiencies and permanent changes, such as closing poker rooms. Approximately 226 employees at our CPL casinos in Poland and 47 employees at Mountaineer belong to trade unions. The trade unions in Poland do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with CPL, but changes in pay of union employees at CPL require approval of the unions. The trade unions at Mountaineer have collective bargaining agreements with Mountaineer.

Human Capital – Our company is led by two gaming industry professionals with a combined industry experience of more than 75 years. Due to extensive industry experience, the team’s diversity of experience gives us the ability to tailor our gaming-based entertainment developments and operations to the unique needs and circumstances of each specific location. We are aware that much of our success is based on our employees’ combined talents, skills and ideas. As an international casino entertainment company, we cater to very different markets with different customer expectations. In order to meet these expectations, we strive to build a workforce that is as diversified as our customers. As of December 31, 2021, 50% of our workforce and 39% of our leadership roles were held by women. 


Focusing on employee development and creating a positive work environment is one of our main priorities. We have training and development programs to provide our employees with the opportunity to succeed and thrive at our company. We seek to provide upward and lateral movement to employees at all locations. In Missouri, for example, we have an Upward Mobility Program to provide front-line employees with information on how they can develop their leadership skills and be prepared to step into a leadership role. This program makes training and educational opportunities available to enhance qualification and permit progress into other career fields through mentorships. 

As a company, we strive to be community leaders and to add value through our products, services, social responsibility and sharing of our financial and human resources to achieve a positive impact on our employees, their families and our fellow citizens. We have committed to supporting the local communities with their requests and needs in an effort to improve the lives of people in these communities. We seek to disburse contributions fairly among several charitable and non-profit organizations. Our management is confident that through working with charitable and non-profit organizations we are able to make a positive difference to the lives of people living in the communities in which we have operations. Our initiatives include donation boxes on the casino floors, volunteer events, fundraising drives, event sponsorships and charity events. Unique to Alberta, Canada is the charitable gaming model in which charitable organizations are licensed to conduct and manage casino events at our casinos.
