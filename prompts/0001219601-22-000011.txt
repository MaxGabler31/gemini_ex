ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Crown Holdings, Inc. (the "Company" or the "Registrant") (where the context requires, the "Company" shall include reference to the Company and its consolidated subsidiary companies) is a Pennsylvania corporation.
The Company is a worldwide leader in the design, manufacture and sale of packaging products for consumer goods and industrial products. The Company's consumer packaging solutions primarily support the beverage and food industries through the sale of aluminum and steel cans. The Company's packaging for industrial products includes steel and plastic consumables and equipment, paper-based protective packaging, and plastic film consumables and equipment, which are sold into the metals, food and beverage, construction, agricultural, corrugated and general industries.
At December 31, 2021, the Company operated 200 plants along with sales and service facilities throughout 40 countries and had approximately 26,000 employees. In 2021, consolidated net sales for the Company were $11.4 billion with 63% derived from operations outside the United States ("U.S.") 
The Company's strategy is to deploy capital into its global beverage can operations to expand production capacity to support growing customer demand in alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink categories. Beverage cans are the world’s most sustainable and recycled beverage packaging and continue to gain market share in new beverage product launches. The Company continues to drive brand differentiation by increasing its ability to offer multiple specialty can sizes. Size variations include slim and sleek cans, as well as larger sizes to help customers differentiate their products. 
Approximately 64% of the Company's consolidated net sales were derived from the Company's global beverage can operations. The Company’s beverage can business is built around local, regional and global markets, which has served to develop the Company’s understanding of global customer and consumer expectations. The Company expects to continue to responsibly add beverage can capacity in many of its growing markets around the world.

Additional financial information concerning the Company’s reportable segments is set forth within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report and under Note Y to the consolidated financial statements.
SALES AND DISTRIBUTION
Global marketers qualify suppliers on the basis of their ability to provide global service, innovative designs and technologies in a cost-effective manner.
With its global reach, the Company primarily markets and sells products to customers through its own sales and marketing staff. In some instances, contracts with customers are centrally negotiated, but products are ordered through and distributed directly by the Company’s local facilities. The Company’s facilities are generally located in proximity to their respective major customers. The Company works closely with customers in order to develop new business and to extend the duration of existing contracts.
Many customers provide the Company with quarterly or annual estimates of product requirements along with related quantities pursuant to which periodic commitments are given. Such estimates assist the Company in managing production and controlling use of working capital. The Company schedules its production to meet customer requirements. Because the production time for the Company’s products is short, any backlog of customer orders in relation to overall sales is not significant.
COMPETITION
Most of the Company’s packaging products for consumer goods are sold in highly competitive markets, primarily based on price, quality, service and performance. The Company competes with other packaging manufacturers as well as with fillers, food processors and packers, some of whom manufacture containers for their own use and for sale to others. The Company’s competitors include, but are not limited to, Ardagh Metal Packaging, Ball Corporation, Ball Metalpack, Mauser Packaging Solutions, Can-Pack S.A., Metal Container Corporation, Silgan Holdings Inc., and Trivium Packaging.
Transit Packaging also faces substantial competition from many regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of its products. Transit Packaging differentiates itself from the competition by leveraging its global scale, broad product portfolio and established brand reputation. Transit Packaging products compete, to some extent, with various other packaging materials, including other products made of paper, plastics, wood and various types of metal.
CUSTOMERS
The Company’s largest beverage can customers consist of many of the leading manufacturers and marketers of packaged consumer products in the world, including Anheuser-Busch InBev, Coca-Cola, Heineken, Keurig Dr Pepper, Molson Coors, Pepsi-Cola and Refresco, among others. Consolidation trends among beverage marketers have led to a concentrated customer base. The Company’s top ten global customers represented in the aggregate approximately 47% of its 2021 consolidated net sales. 
For the year ended December 31, 2021, two customers each accounted for 11% of the Company's consolidated net sales. These customers are global beverage companies served by the Company's beverage operations in the Americas, Europe and Asia. These same two customers accounted for 11% and 10%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, one of these customers accounted for 12% of the Company's consolidated net sales.
Crown Holdings, Inc.

Each reportable segment, with the exception of Transit Packaging, has major customers and the loss of one or more of these major customers could have a material adverse effect on an individual segment or the Company as a whole. In addition to sales to Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, the Company also supplies independent licensees of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Company's global Research, Development & Engineering ("RD&E") Center for packaging products for consumer goods is located in Wantage, U.K. The Company utilizes its centralized corporate RD&E capabilities to advance and deliver technologies for the Company's worldwide packaging activities that (1) promote development of value-added metal packaging systems for its customers, (2) design cost-efficient manufacturing processes, systems and materials and material-efficient container designs that further the sustainability of metal packaging, (3) provide continuous quality and/or production efficiency improvements in its manufacturing facilities, (4) advance customer and supplier relationships, and (5) provide value-added engineering services and technical support. These capabilities facilitate (1) the identification of new and/or expanded market opportunities by working directly with customers to develop new packaging products or enhance existing packaging products through the application of new technologies that better differentiate customers' products in the retail environment (for example, the creation of new packaging shapes, novel decoration methods, or the addition of digital content through unique codes) and/or the incorporation of consumer-valued features (for example, improved openability and/or ease of use) and (2) the reduction of manufacturing costs by reducing the material content of the Company's products (while retaining necessary performance characteristics), reducing spoilage, and increasing operating efficiencies in manufacturing facilities. The corporate RD&E Center is also applying technical expertise to advance product design and manufacturing capabilities for the Company's Transit Packaging segment, supplementing their existing product developments.
The Company maintains a substantial portfolio of patents and other intellectual property ("IP") in the field of metal packaging systems and seeks strategic partnerships to extend its IP in existing and emerging markets. As a result, the Company has licensed IP in geographic regions where the Company has a limited market presence today. Existing technologies such as SuperEnd® beverage ends, 360 End™ beverage ends, Easy-Flow™ beverage ends, Eole™ easy-open food ends, OrbitTM easy-open metal vacuum closures, EcoPeelTM peelable food ends, PeelFitTM peelable food ends and can shaping have been licensed in Europe, Australia, Japan, and Africa to provide customers with global access to Crown's brand building innovations.
Transit Packaging is well known throughout its markets for its ability to drive product innovation and leadership in new technologies. Transit Packaging focuses on market driven innovation and has a long history of creating product and service solutions that solve problems and create value for its customers. Transit Packaging platforms are primarily responsible for designing and executing their own research and development projects and the development process is comprised of a customer-oriented, "outside-in" approach. They work with customers to determine their most pressing industrial packaging challenges, utilizing a rigorous multi-step product development process to ensure that they shape the ultimate product for both the customer and the broader market. Transit Packaging's track record of new product innovation is largely due to the success of this model.
Transit Packaging has been an industry leader in industrial packaging innovation over the last 100 years as evidenced by their introduction of the first strap packaging product (1913), the first fully-automatic strapping machine (1946), the industry's first battery operated plastic strap hand tools (1995), and most recently the industry's first battery-operated steel strap hand tools (2013). At the core of its intellectual property strategy is a focus on obtaining quality patents that cover key products and technologies, in alignment with its business objectives. Transit Packaging has grown its global patent portfolio to over 320 U.S. issued patents or pending patent applications and over 1,130 foreign issued patents or pending patent applications. The portfolio broadly covers about 320 customized technologies and spans diverse business platforms, as well as the different countries in which it operates. 
The Company spent $47 million in 2021, $48 million in 2020, and $50 million in 2019 in its RD&E activities. Certain of these activities are expected to improve and expand the Company's product lines in the future. These expenditures include projects to improve manufacturing efficiencies, reduce unit costs, and develop new and improved value-added packaging systems. 
MATERIALS AND SUPPLIERS
The Company uses various raw materials, primarily aluminum and steel, in its manufacturing operations. Transit Packaging also uses materials derived from crude oil and natural gas, such as polyethylene and polypropylene. In general, these raw materials are purchased in highly competitive, price-sensitive markets, which have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. These and other materials used in the manufacturing process have historically been available in adequate supply from multiple sources.
Crown Holdings, Inc.

The Company has agreements for what it considers adequate supplies of raw materials. However, sufficient quantities may not be available in the future due to, among other things, shortages due to excessive demand, weather or other factors, including disruptions in supply caused by raw material transportation or production delays. From time to time, some of the raw materials have been in short supply but, to date, these shortages have not had a significant impact on the Company’s operations.
In 2021, consumption of aluminum and steel represented 43% and 8%, respectively, of consolidated cost of products sold, excluding depreciation and amortization. Due to the significance of these raw materials to the overall cost of products sold, raw material efficiency is a critical cost component of the products manufactured. Supplier consolidations, changes in ownership, government regulations, political unrest and increased demand for raw materials in the packaging and other industries, among other risk factors, could cause uncertainty as to the availability of and the level of prices at which the Company might be able to source such raw materials in the future. Moreover, the prices of aluminum and steel can be subject to significant volatility. The Company’s raw material supply contracts vary as to terms and duration, with aluminum contracts typically multi-year in duration with fluctuating prices based on aluminum ingot costs and steel contracts typically one year in duration with fixed prices or set repricing dates. The Company generally attempts to mitigate its aluminum and steel price risk by matching its purchase obligations with its sales agreements; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to fully mitigate that risk.
The Company also uses commodity and foreign currency forwards in an attempt to manage its exposure to aluminum price volatility.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to fully recover from its customers the impact of aluminum and steel price increases or that the use of derivative instruments will effectively manage the Company’s exposure to price volatility. In addition, if the Company were unable to purchase aluminum and steel for a significant period of time, its operations would be disrupted, and if the Company were unable to fully recover the higher cost of aluminum and steel, its financial results may be adversely affected. As a result of continuing global supply and demand pressures, other commodity-related costs affecting the Company’s business may increase as well, including utility and freight-related costs. The Company will attempt to increase prices on its products accordingly in order to recover these costs. Certain of the Company's sales contracts contain non-metal pass-through provisions that include annual selling price adjustments based on a producer price index. In certain years the referenced index may be negative, requiring the Company to reduce its selling price while its actual costs may have increased.
In response to the volatility of raw material prices, ongoing productivity and cost reduction efforts in recent years have focused on improving raw material cost management. The Company’s manufacturing facilities are dependent, in varying degrees, upon the availability of water and processed energy, such as natural gas and electricity. Certain of these may become difficult or impossible to obtain on acceptable terms due to external factors, which could increase the Company’s costs or interrupt its business.
SUSTAINABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company has a Corporate Environmental Sustainability Policy, a Human Rights Policy, a Responsible and Ethical Sourcing Policy, a Conflict Minerals Policy, and an Environmental, Health and Safety Policy. In addition, in 2020, the Company debuted its Twentyby30 Sustainability program, which creates an opportunity for the Company to move beyond the challenges of addressing regulatory and supply chain disruption risks caused by environmental, social and governance ("ESG") concerns. The program identifies five distinct pillars of action - Climate Action, Resource Efficiency, Optimum Circularity, Working Together and Never Compromise - that represent topics of urgent global concern and areas of the business in which the Company can create notable impact and twenty measurable ESG goals to be completed by 2030 or sooner. The Company has committed to reporting on each aspect of the Twentyby30 program annually. 
The Company is committed to continuous improvement in product design and manufacturing practices to provide the best outcome for the environment, both now and in the future. The Company's Climate Action strategy focuses on production efficiency, product and process innovation, strategic material procurement and utilization of renewable electricity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Aluminum and steel, by their very nature, can be recycled at high effectiveness and can be repeatedly reused to form new consumer packaging with no degradation in performance, quality or safety. By recycling these metals, large amounts of energy and water can be saved and significant carbon dioxide emissions avoided. In addition to the original goals included in the Twentyby30 program the Company has recently announced its further commitment to work with industry partners to achieve new global recycling rate goals for aluminum beverage cans as part of the Company's Optimum Circularity pillar. The targets are connected to the regions where the Company maintains operations. 
Crown Holdings, Inc.

The Company’s operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, disposal of waste, discharges into water, emissions into the atmosphere and the protection of employee health and safety. Future regulations may impose stricter environmental requirements on the packaging industry and may require additional capital investment. Anticipated future restrictions in some jurisdictions on the use of certain coatings may require the Company to employ additional control equipment or process modifications. 
There can be no assurance that current or future environmental laws or liabilities will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Discussion of the Company’s environmental matters is contained within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report under the caption “Environmental Matters,” and under Note P to the consolidated financial statements.
HUMAN CAPITAL
At December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 26,000 employees worldwide, with approximately 6,000 employed by the Americas Beverage segment, 3,500 employed by the European Beverage segment, 4,500 employed by the Asia Pacific segment, 8,500 employed by the Transit Packaging segment and 3,500 employed by Other. 
A significant portion of the Company’s workforce is unionized. Collective bargaining agreements with varying terms and expiration dates cover approximately 12,000 employees. The Company did not experience any union-initiated work stoppages during the 2021 fiscal year and believes that its employee relations remain good. The Company does not expect that renegotiation of any collective bargaining agreements expiring in 2022 will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flow. 
The Company believes that its employees are key to achieving the Company’s business goals and growth strategy. Attracting, developing and retaining the best people globally is crucial to all aspects of the Company’s activities. Towards this end, the Company has cultivated a senior management team with extensive industry experience and highly specialized skills and has consistently re‑invested in necessary resources to effectively staff and efficiently support its businesses. The Company aspires to offer market rate competitive salaries for the regions in which it operates, and to engage employees with rewarding opportunities that both contribute to the Company’s success and maximize their personal potential.
The Company is committed to the health and safety of its employees and their families. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 ("COVID-19") pandemic, the Company has taken specific actions to ensure the safety of its employees. The Company’s COVID-19 Task Teams have been actively monitoring scientific developments and government actions related to the virus; instituting policies and procedures to minimize risk for the Company’s global team members and facilities and to enable the Company to continue serving its customers in a safe and timely manner; sharing information with the workforce about the virus and actions to prevent its spread; and assisting personnel in their efforts to get vaccinated. The Company has updated many of its policies to adapt to the pandemic environment and has instituted increased safety measures in its manufacturing facilities to ensure the safety of employees and the products they produce. The Company's policies are informed by the latest updates from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization and are compliant with the directives of local governmental authorities. The Company has implemented a variety of other precautionary measures, including sanitizing efforts, modifications of workspaces, distribution of personal protective equipment in its manufacturing facilities and offices, and expansion of remote working opportunities.
In addition to the Company’s COVID-19 related efforts, the Company supports the well-being of its employees and their families with a variety of physical, mental and social wellness programs. These programs differ by region, but include Company-sponsored or subsidized medical insurance over and above government provisions, annual medical, cancer and audiometry screenings, voluntary health fairs and employee mental health assistance programs to improve health and wellness. The Company has built a Total Safety Culture that provides the framework for all health and safety initiatives across the Company and empowers employees to take a proactive role in their safety and that of their fellow employees. The Company’s focus is on behaviors and attitudes and achieving success in incident, injury and near-miss reductions. 
The Company recognizes that a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to its future business success. It has therefore integrated Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) as a dimension of its Twentyby30 sustainability program aiming first to embed D&I awareness in its organizational culture. The Company believes different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives generate powerful new ideas and foster good and sustainable decision making. The Company’s approach includes deployment of D&I training initiatives, such as psychological safety and unconscious bias trainings, and improvement of its recruitment and onboarding processes. Recruitment programs to attract diverse talent into the organization include a new three-year program, first focused on engineering skills, which includes assignments in various businesses and countries to encourage broader thinking and a flexible mindset. This program provides an opportunity for diversity candidates to progress more quickly to 
Crown Holdings, Inc.

higher functions within the organization. Finally, the Company continues to focus on developing and empowering women and share progress and achievements on internal and external social media.
The Company places a high value on skills management and lifelong learning opportunities that benefit both the individual employee and the whole Company. The Company provides a variety of educational opportunities, including a mix of mandatory and voluntary training programs that occur in classrooms, online or on the job. The Company also recognizes the importance of multifunctional teams and as such, management training includes international exposure and cross divisional activity to develop common approaches and values. Talent development programs vary by region, but include leadership programs designed to support operations leadership, lean manufacturing operations and employee performance management. 
The Company maintains a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which describes its policies with respect to, among other things, anti-corruption, protection of confidential information, and environmental, health and safety matters, as well as the Company’s commitment to ensuring that all of its employees are treated with respect and dignity and are able to work in an environment free from all forms of unlawful employment discrimination. The Company’s Compliance Teams are responsible for implementing these policies. The Company's compliance program includes a mechanism for employees to report suspected violations of Company policies on a confidential basis, including anonymous reporting where permitted by local law.
WORKING CAPITAL
The Company generally uses cash during the first nine months of the year to finance seasonal working capital needs. The Company’s working capital requirements are funded by cash flows from operations, revolving credit facilities and receivables securitization and factoring programs.
