ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Basic Business
 STRATTEC SECURITY CORPORATION designs, develops, manufactures and markets automotive access control products including mechanical locks and keys, electronically enhanced locks and keys, passive entry passive start systems (PEPS), steering column and instrument panel ignition lock housings, latches, power sliding side door systems, power tailgate systems, power lift gate systems, power deck lid systems, door handles and related products for primarily North American automotive customers. We also supply global automotive manufacturers through a unique strategic relationship with WITTE Automotive (“WITTE”) of Velbert, Germany and ADAC Plastics Inc., doing business as ADAC Automotive (“ADAC”), of Grand Rapids, Michigan called VAST Automotive Group (“VAST”). Under this unique strategic relationship STRATTEC, WITTE and ADAC market the products of each company to global customers under the “VAST Automotive Group” brand name (as more fully described under Vehicle Access Systems Technology LLC herein). STRATTEC products are shipped to customer locations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, South America, Korea, China and India, and we, along with our VAST LLC partners, provide full service and aftermarket support for each VAST Automotive Group partners’ products. 
History
 The product line that became STRATTEC was part of Briggs & Stratton Corporation’s founding business in 1908. In 1995, STRATTEC was spun off from Briggs & Stratton through a tax-free distribution to the then-existing Briggs & Stratton shareholders and has been an independent public company for over twenty-seven years.
 Our history in the automotive security business spans over 110 years. STRATTEC has been the world’s largest producer of automotive locks and keys since the late 1920s, and we currently maintain a significant share of the North American markets for these products.
 Products
 Our traditional products are lock sets (locks and keys) for cars and light trucks. Typically, two keys are provided with each vehicle lockset.  Most of the vehicles we currently supply are using keys with sophisticated radio frequency identification technology for additional theft prevention. Keys with remote entry devices integrated into a single unit and bladeless electronic keys as well as turn-key passive entry passive start systems (PEPS) have been added to our product line and are gaining in popularity.
 Ignition lock housings represent another access control product for us. These housings are the mating part for our ignition locks and typically are part of the steering column structure, although there are instrument panel-mounted versions for certain vehicle applications. These housings are either die cast from zinc or injection molded plastic and may include electronic components for theft deterrent systems.  
 We have developed and are continuing to develop access control products, including trunk latches, lift gate latches, tailgate latches, hood latches, side door latches and related hardware. With our acquisition of Delphi Corporation’s Power Products Group in fiscal 2009, we have been supplying and continue to supply various power access devices for sliding side doors, tailgates, lift gates and trunk lids to our automotive industry customers. Through a joint venture formed with ADAC Automotive during fiscal 2007, we also supply painted and non-painted door handles and components and related vehicle access hardware.
 In recent years, more and more vehicle access systems have moved from purely mechanical components to integrated electro-mechanical systems. STRATTEC has been at the forefront of this new technology, working with Original Equipment Manufacturers’ (OEMs) product development and purchasing groups to provide cost-effective, innovative solutions to the challenges facing our customers. 
 STRATTEC’s customer-focused structure and formalized product development process helps us identify and meet customer needs in the shortest time possible. From concept and design, through implementation and into the aftermarket, STRATTEC delivers products that provide the optimum value solution to security and access control requirements. We have a comprehensive Products & Solutions portfolio that can be viewed on our website at www.strattec.com (see “Available Information” below for additional information).
 To maintain a strong focus on each of these access control products, we have Product Business Managers who oversee the product’s entire life cycle, including product concept, application, manufacturing, warranty analysis, service/aftermarket, and financial/commercial issues. The Product Business Managers work closely with our sales organization, our engineering group, and our manufacturing operations to ensure their products are receiving the right amount of quality attention so that their value to STRATTEC and the market place is enhanced.

Markets
 We are a direct supplier to OEM automotive and light truck manufacturers as well as other transportation-related manufacturers. Our largest customers are Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler Automobiles), General Motors Company and Ford Motor Company. Our access control product mix varies by customer, but generally our overall sales tend to be highest in door handles and trim components produced by ADAC-STRATTEC de Mexico, followed by lock and key, including aftermarket produced by STRATTEC de Mexico, power access products produced by STRATTEC Power Access de Mexico, and latch mechanisms and ignition lock housing components produced by STRATTEC de Mexico. See Operations discussion included herein for further description.
 Direct sales to various OEMs represented approximately 79% of our total sales for both fiscal 2022 and 2021.  The remainder of our revenue is received primarily through sales to the OEM service channels, the aftermarket and Tier 1 automotive supplier customers, and sales of certain products to non-automotive commercial customers.
 Sales to our major automotive customers, both OEM and Tier 1, are coordinated through direct sales personnel located in our Detroit-area office. Sales are also facilitated through daily interaction between our Program Managers, Application Engineers and other product engineering personnel. Sales to other OEM customers are accomplished through a combination of our sales personnel located in Detroit and personnel in our Milwaukee headquarters office.
 The majority of our OEM products are sold in North America. While some exporting is done to Tier 1 and automotive assembly plants in Europe, Asia and South America, we are in the process of expanding our presence in these markets and elsewhere through the Vehicle Access Systems Technology LLC (VAST LLC) joint venture we jointly own with WITTE Automotive and ADAC Automotive.  VAST is described in more detail on pages 4, 5, 43, 44 and 45 in this Form 10-K.
 OEM service and replacement parts are sold to the OEM’s own service operations. In addition, we distribute our components and security products to the automotive aftermarket through approximately 50 authorized wholesale distributors, as well as other marketers and users of component parts, including export customers. Increasingly, our products find their way into the retail channel, specifically the hardware store channel. Our ability to provide a full line of keys to that channel has been accomplished through the introduction of the STRATTEC “XL” key line. This extension to our product line includes keys that we currently do not supply on an OEM basis, including keys for Toyota, Honda and other popular domestic and import vehicles. This extended line of keys enables automotive repair specialists to satisfy consumer needs for repair or replacement parts. Our aftermarket activities are serviced through a warehousing operation in El Paso, Texas.
 Customer Sales Focus
 To bring the proper focus to the relationships with our major customers, we have six customer-focused teams, each with a Director of Sales, one or two Engineering Program Managers and various Customer Application Engineers. In addition to customer teams for General Motors, Ford and Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler), we currently have teams for New Domestic Vehicle Manufacturers (primarily the Japanese and Korean automotive manufactures), User Interface Controls (formerly Driver Control/Ignition Lock Housing) customers, Tier 1 customers, and Service and Aftermarket customers. Sales and engineering for ADAC-STRATTEC LLC (described in greater detail below) are supported by our partner in this joint venture, ADAC Automotive.  
 Each Sales Director is responsible for the overall relationship between STRATTEC and a specific customer group.  Program Managers are responsible for coordinating cross functional activities while managing new product programs for their customers. 
 Product Engineering Focus
 To best serve our customers’ product needs, STRATTEC’s engineering resources are organized into groups which focus on specific access control applications. We currently have six engineering groups:  Locks and Keys, Aftermarket, Latches, Power Access Devices, User Interface Controls (formerly Driver Control/Ignition Lock Housings) and Wireless Systems (formerly Electrical). Each group has a Product Business Manager, an Engineering Manager and a complement of skilled engineers who design and develop products for specific applications. In doing this, each engineering group works closely with both the customer and product teams, Engineering Program Managers, and Application Engineers.
 Underlying this organization is a formalized product development process to identify and meet customer needs in the shortest possible time. By following this streamlined development system, we shorten product lead times, tighten our response to market changes and provide our customers with the optimum value solution to their security/access control requirements. STRATTEC is also IATF 16949:2016 and ISO 14001 certified. This means we embrace the philosophy that quality should exist not only in the finished product, but in every step of our processes as well.

Operations
 A significant number of the components that go into our products are manufactured at our headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This facility produces zinc die cast components, stampings and milled key blades. We have three owned production facilities currently in operation in Juarez, Mexico operating as STRATTEC de Mexico. Plant No. 1 houses key finishing and assembly operations for locksets and ignition lock housings. Plant No. 2 houses our key molding and plastic injection molding operations for door handles and components, as well as containing dedicated space for the assembly operations of ADAC-STRATTEC de Mexico. Plant No. 3 houses both latch and power access assembly operations for STRATTEC Power Access de Mexico. Plant No. 4 is in Leon, Mexico and houses our custom paint system for door handles and assembly for ADAC-STRATTEC de Mexico and is owned by the ADAC-STRATTEC de Mexico joint venture.
Vehicle Access Systems Technology LLC
 In fiscal 2001, we entered into a formal alliance with WITTE-Velbert GmbH, an automotive supplier based in Germany which designs, develops, manufactures and markets automotive access control products for European-based customers. This alliance consisted of two initiatives. The first was a set of legal agreements which allowed STRATTEC to manufacture and market WITTE’s core products in North America, and WITTE to manufacture and market STRATTEC’s core products in Europe. The second initiative was a 50:50 joint venture, WITTE-STRATTEC LLC, to invest in operations with local partners in strategic markets outside of Europe and North America.
 In February of 2006, we announced the expansion of this alliance and related joint venture with the addition of a third partner, ADAC Plastics, Inc.  ADAC, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, adds North American expertise in door handles, a part of WITTE’s core product line that STRATTEC did not support, and an expertise in color-matched painting of these components.
 With the expansion of the alliance, we can offer a full range of access control related products available on a global basis to support customer programs. To identify this powerful combination of independent companies focused on working together, we renamed the joint venture Vehicle Access Systems Technology LLC (VAST LLC). We now refer to the combination of the alliance structure and joint venture as “VAST Automotive Group” (VAST). WITTE is now called WITTE Automotive, and ADAC is now doing business as ADAC Automotive. We have adopted a common graphic image in which we share a logo mark and colors, and a specific VAST logo used on the partners’ printed and electronic presentation materials. What is now VAST made investments with a local partner in Brazil in September, 2001, and local partners in China in March, 2002. However, during fiscal 2010, VAST LLC purchased the remaining 40 percent interest of its local partners in the China venture. VAST China is now wholly owned by VAST LLC and had annual net sales of approximately $190.4 million and $209.0 million during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. This gave STRATTEC a one-third interest in VAST China’s activities in the Chinese/Asian market for manufacturing and assembly of painted door handles, locksets and latch products. VAST China currently operates out of two manufacturing facilities in Taicang and Jingzhou, China. The Fuzhou, China facility closed during our fiscal 2021, and the land and building are currently for sale. In March, 2014, VAST LLC purchased the remaining 49 percent interest of its local partner in Brazil, which had annual net sales of approximately $1.3 million and $1.5 million during fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 On April 30, 2015 VAST LLC executed a purchase agreement to become a 50:50 Joint Venture partner with Minda Management Services Limited, an affiliate of both Minda Corporation Limited and Spark Minda, Ashok Minda Group of New Delhi, India (collectively, “Minda”). As part of this transaction, VAST acquired a fifty percent equity interest in the former Minda-Valeo Security Systems joint venture entity, based in Pune, India. This joint venture entity was renamed Minda-VAST Access Systems (“Minda-VAST”). Minda-VAST has operations in Pune and Delhi and had annual sales of approximately $29.4 million and $23.8 million during fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. Minda is a leading manufacturer of security & access products and handles, for both OEMs and the aftermarket in India. Minda-VAST financial results are accounted for on the equity method of accounting by VAST LLC.
 For further VAST LLC financial information, see “Equity Earnings of Joint Ventures” included in Notes to Financial Statements under Item 8 in this Form 10-K.
 VAST is the embodiment of STRATTEC’s, WITTE’s and ADAC’s globalization strategy. Collectively as a group, we are developing VAST as a global brand with which we are jointly pursuing business with identified global customers. Those identified customers are General Motors, Ford, Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler), Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler, Honda, Volvo, Renault/Nissan and Hyundai/Kia.
 To manage our customer relationships and coordinate global ventures and activities, we have established a VAST Management Group led by a President. The Management Group includes three Vice Presidents, one each from WITTE, STRATTEC and ADAC. With the focus provided by this Management Group, VAST is able to manage global programs, in accordance with STRATTEC and our partners’ globalization strategy, with a single point of contact for customers, with the added advantage of providing regional support from the partners’ operating entities. Combined with VAST LLC’s ventures in China and Brazil, and sales/engineering offices in Japan and Korea, this structure establishes our global footprint.

STRATTEC de MEXICO
 We have formed STRATTEC de Mexico as a wholly owned subsidiary of STRATTEC to own and operate three production facilities in Juarez, Mexico. At these three facilities we house our assembly operations for locksets and ignition lock housings, our key finishing and plastic injection molding operations, our assembly operations for ADAC-STRATTEC de Mexico noted below and our latch and power access assembly operations for STRATTEC POWER ACCESS de Mexico noted below.
ADAC-STRATTEC LLC and ADAC-STRATTEC de MEXICO
 During fiscal 2007, we formed a new entity with ADAC Automotive called ADAC-STRATTEC LLC including a wholly owned Mexican subsidiary ADAC-STRATTEC de Mexico (collectively, ASdM). The purpose of this joint venture is to produce certain ADAC and STRATTEC products utilizing ADAC’s plastic molding injection expertise and STRATTEC’s assembly capability. ASdM currently operates out of defined space in STRATTEC de Mexico Plant No. 2 located in Juarez, Mexico. Products from this joint venture include non-painted door handle components and exterior trim components for OEM customers producing in North America. STRATTEC owns 51% of this joint venture and its financial results are consolidated into STRATTEC’s financial statements. In our fiscal year ending 2022, ASdM was near break-even due to rising material costs that could not be passed on to customers through higher customer purchase prices. In our fiscal 2021, ASdM was profitable. ASdM represented $111.8 million and $126.2 million of our consolidated net sales in our fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. STRATTEC de Mexico Plant No. 4 is in Leon, Mexico and houses our custom paint system for door handles and assembly for ADAC-STRATTEC de Mexico.
STRATTEC POWER ACCESS LLC and STRATTEC POWER ACCESS de MEXICO
 During fiscal year 2009, we formed a new subsidiary with WITTE Automotive called STRATTEC POWER ACCESS LLC (SPA) to acquire the North American business of the Delphi Power Products Group.  WITTE is a 20 percent minority owner. SPA in turn owns 100 percent of a Mexican subsidiary, STRATTEC POWER ACCESS de Mexico. The purpose of this subsidiary is to produce power access devices for sliding side doors, tailgates, lift gates, trunk lids and other related products. STRATTEC POWER ACCESS de Mexico currently operates out of defined space in STRATTEC de Mexico Plant No. 3 located in Juarez, Mexico. Financial results for SPA are consolidated in STRATTEC’s financial statements. In our fiscal years ending 2022 and 2021, SPA was profitable and represented $95.7 million and $95.2 million, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.
 Seasonal Nature of the Business
 The manufacturing of components used in automobiles is driven by the normal peaks and valleys associated with the automotive industry. Typically, the months of July and August are relatively slow as summer vacation shutdowns and model year changeovers occur at the automotive assembly plants. September volumes increase rapidly as each new model year begins. This volume strength continues through October and into early November. As the holiday and winter seasons approach, the demand for automobiles slows, as does production.  March usually brings a major sales and production increase, which then continues through most of June. This results in our first fiscal quarter sales and operating results typically being our weakest, with the remaining quarters being more consistent. As described elsewhere herein under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Executive Overview, adverse business and operational issues resulting from the semiconductor chip supply shortages, the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the conflict in the Ukraine have adversely impacted the timing, availability and cost of certain material component parts and raw materials for the production of our products and the products of our customers. These events have temporarily disrupted our normal seasonal sales patterns during fiscal 2022 and 2021.

Emerging Technologies 
Automotive vehicle access systems, which are both theft deterrent and consumer friendly, are trending toward electro-mechanical and connected devices.  Electronic companies are developing user identification systems such as bio-systems, card holder (transmitter) systems, etc., while mechanical locks, keys, housings, and latches are evolving to accommodate electronics. We believe we are positioning ourselves as a vehicle access control supplier by building our product, engineering and manufacturing expertise in the required electro-mechanical products, which include vehicle access latches, keys with remote entry electronic systems, ignition interface systems with passive start and Phone as a Key (PaaK) capabilities. In both 2018 and 2019, we were awarded the Automotive News Pace Award for Excellence and Innovation for our Invis-A-RiseTM Power Liftgate and Invis-A-RiseTM Power Tailgate products. As the automotive industry continues developing various levels of autonomous vehicles, we believe that we are well positioned to continue the development and incorporation of power sliding doors, power tailgates and other consumer convenience features into these types of vehicles.
 These technologies benefit us by increasing our potential customer base as a Tier 2 supplier while maintaining our Tier 1 status on some product lines and by adding additional product line availability.
 Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Our primary raw materials are high-grade zinc, brass, nickel silver, steel, aluminum, plastic resins and semiconductor chips and other electronics. These materials are generally available from a number of suppliers, but we have chosen to concentrate our sourcing with one primary vendor for each commodity. We believe our sources for raw materials are very reliable and adequate for our needs. We have not experienced any significant long term supply problems in our operations. However, the impacts of the Coronavirus and geopolitical instability have adversely impacted the supply of certain semiconductor chips and related electronics components which has adversely impacted our, and our customers’, ability to build product and fulfill orders. See further discussion under “Risk Related to Coronavirus and Other Health Epidemics,” “Risk Related to Geopolitical Instability,” and “Risk Factors-Sources of and Fluctuations in Market Prices of Raw Materials” included under Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
 Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We believe that the success of our business will not only result from the technical competence, creativity and marketing abilities of our employees but also from the protection of our intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights. As part of our ongoing research, development and manufacturing activities, we have a policy of seeking patents on new products, processes and improvements when appropriate. 
 Although, in the aggregate, the intellectual property discussed herein are of considerable importance to the manufacturing and marketing of many of our access control products, we do not consider any single patent or trademark or group of related patents or trademarks to be material to our business as a whole, except for the STRATTEC and STRATTEC with logo trademarks. 
 We also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. We maintain confidentiality agreements with our key executives. In addition, we enter into confidentiality agreements with selected suppliers, consultants and employees as appropriate to evaluate new products or business relationships pertinent to our success. However, there can be no assurance that others will not independently obtain similar information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or that we can effectively protect our trade secrets. 
 Dependence Upon Significant Customers
A very significant portion of our annual sales are to General Motors Company, Ford Motor Company, and Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler Automobiles).  These three customers accounted for approximately 65 percent and 62 percent of our net sales in 2022 and in 2021, respectively.  Further information regarding sales to our largest customers is set forth under the caption “Risk Factors - Loss of Significant Customers, Vehicle Content, Vehicle Models and Market Share” and “Risk Factors – Production Slowdowns by Customers” included under Item 1A of this Form 10-K and “Notes to Financial Statements-Sales and Receivable Concentration” included in Notes to Financial Statements under Item 8 in this Form 10-K.  
 The products sold to these customers are model specific, fitting only certain defined applications. Consequently, we are highly dependent on our major customers for their business, and on these customers' ability to produce and sell vehicles which utilize our products. We have enjoyed good relationships with General Motors Company, Stellantis, Ford Motor Company and other customers in the past, and expect to continue to do so in the future. However, a significant change in the purchasing practices of, or a significant loss of volume from, one or more of these customers could have a detrimental effect on our financial performance. We cannot provide any assurance that any lost sales volume could be replaced despite our historical relationships with our customers.

Sales and Marketing; Backlog
 We provide our customers with engineered access control products including locksets, fobs, push button passive entry passive start ignition systems, steering column lock housings, electromechanical latches, power sliding door systems, power tailgate systems, power liftgate systems, power decklids, painted and non-painted door handles, door handle components and trim and other access products which are unique to specific vehicles. Any given vehicle will typically take 1 to 3 years of development and engineering design time prior to being offered to the public. The access control products are designed concurrently with the vehicle. Therefore, commitment to STRATTEC as the production source for such products and components occurs 1 to 3 years prior to the start of production for such components. We employ an engineering staff that assists in providing design and technical solutions to our customers. We believe that our engineering expertise is a competitive advantage and contributes toward our strong market position in our industry. For example, we regularly provide innovative design proposals for our product offerings to our customers that we believe will improve customer access, vehicle security system quality, theft deterrence and system cost. 
 The typical process used by automotive manufacturers in selecting a supplier for access control products is to offer the business opportunity to us and several of our competitors. Each competitor will pursue the opportunity, doing its best to provide the customer with the most attractive proposal. Price pressure is strong during this process but once an agreement is reached, a commitment is made for each year of the product program. Typically, price reductions resulting from productivity improvement by STRATTEC over the life of the product program are included in the contract and are estimated in evaluating each of these opportunities. A blanket purchase order, a contract indicating a specified part will be supplied at a specified price during a defined time period, is issued by customers for each model year. Production quantity releases or quantity commitments are made to that purchase order for weekly deliveries to the customer. As a consequence and because we are a "Just-in-Time" supplier to the automotive industry, we do not maintain a backlog of orders in the classic sense for future production and shipment and, accordingly, we are unable to provide a meaningful backlog comparison from year to year. 
 Competition 
We compete with domestic and foreign-based competitors on the basis of custom product design, engineering support, quality, delivery and price. While the number of direct competitors in our product markets is currently relatively small, the automotive manufacturers actively encourage competition between potential suppliers. We have a large share of the North American market for our access control products because of our ability to provide optimal value, which is a beneficial combination of price, quality, technical support, program management, innovation and aftermarket support. In order to reduce access control product production costs while still offering a wide range of technical support, we utilize assembly operations and certain light manufacturing operations in Mexico, which results in lower labor costs as compared to the United States. 
 As locks and keys become more sophisticated and involve additional electronics, competitors with specific electronic expertise may emerge to challenge us. To address this, we have in recent years strengthened our electrical engineering knowledge and service. We are also working with several electronics suppliers to jointly develop and supply these advanced products.
 Our lockset, steering column lock housing, latches and power access competitors include Huf North America, Ushin, Valeo, Tokai-Rika, Alpha-Tech, Honda Lock, Shin Chang, Magna, Edscha, Stabilus, Aisin, Brose, Mitsuba, Ohi, Kiekert, Inteva, Novares and Gecom. For additional information related to competition, see the information set forth under “Risk Factors-Highly Competitive Automotive Supply Industry” included under Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
 Research and Development
 We engage in research and development activities pertinent to automotive access control. A major area of focus for research is the expanding role of vehicle access via electronic interlocks and modes of communicating authorization data between consumers and vehicles. Development activities include new products, applications and product performance improvements. In addition, specialized data collection equipment is developed to facilitate increased product development efficiency and continuous quality improvements. For fiscal years 2022 and 2021, we incurred approximately $12.2 million and $10.8 million, respectively, on research and development. We believe that, historically, we have committed sufficient resources to research and development and we intend to continue to invest in the future as required to support additional product programs associated with both existing and new customers. Patents are pursued and will continue to be pursued as appropriate to protect our interests resulting from these activities.
Customer Tooling
 We incur costs related to tooling used in component production and assembly.  Some of these costs are reimbursed by customers who then own the tools involved.  See the information set forth under “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Customer Tooling in Progress” included in Notes to Financial Statements under Item 8 in this Form 10-K.

Environmental Compliance
As is the case with other manufacturers, we are subject to Federal, state, local and foreign laws and other legal requirements relating to the generation, storage, transport, treatment and disposal of materials as a result of our manufacturing and assembly operations. These laws include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (as amended), the Clean Air Act (as amended), the Clean Water Act of 1990 (as amended) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (as amended). We have an environmental management system that is ISO-14001 certified.  We believe that our existing environmental management system is adequate and we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures in the environmental area.     
 As discussed in “Commitments and Contingencies” under Notes to Financial Statement under Item 8 in this Form 10-K, a site at our Milwaukee facility is contaminated by a solvent spill from a former above-ground solvent storage tank located on the east side of the facility, which spill occurred in 1985. We continue to monitor this situation. 
 We do not currently anticipate any materially adverse impact on our financial statements or competitive position as a result of compliance with Federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws or other legal requirements. However, risk of environmental liability and charges associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of our business and there is no assurance that material liabilities or charges could not arise.  
 Human Capital
At July 3, 2022, we had approximately 3,373 associates worldwide, of which approximately 488 were employed in the United States and approximately 2,885 were employed outside of the United States. Approximately 180 or 5.3 percent were represented by a collective bargaining agreement at our Milwaukee, Wisconsin facility, all of whom are our production associates. Approximately 104 or 3.1 percent were represented by a collective bargaining agreement at our Leon, Mexico facility. In recent years, we have not experienced any significant work slowdowns, stoppages or other labor disruptions. The current contract with our Milwaukee unionized associates is effective through November 1, 2025. The current contract with our Leon unionized associates is effective through April 12, 2023.  
 We are guided by our “Values and Beliefs” mission statement that focuses on Empowerment, Communication, Citizenship, Enterprise, Change and Consensus. We remain committed to areas of work place safety, product quality and customer satisfaction. Successful execution of our mission is dependent on attracting, developing and retaining key associates and members of our management team, as well as providing competitive pay and benefits.
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, STRATTEC has generally maintained its headcount as we accommodated our operations to the virus environment. We have taken what we believe to be appropriate measures to ensure the health and safety of our associates and permitted remote working.
 Social Responsibility
 We are committed to conducting business and making decisions honestly, fairly and within the law, and are guided by our “Values and Beliefs” mission statement. We are dedicated to earning and keeping the trust and confidence of our shareholders, customers and associates as well as the communities where we do business. 
 Our “Code of Business Ethics” provides guidelines and a framework for conducting business in an ethical manner. These beliefs go beyond STRATTEC and are expected of our suppliers as detailed in our “Supplier Code of Conduct.” We have adopted policies that seek to eliminate human trafficking, slavery, child labor etc. from our global supply chain. In addition, we annually comply and file a Form SD with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding “Conflict Minerals Disclosure and Report” as directed by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The purpose of this report is to help prevent products used to finance or benefit armed groups in the covered countries of this filing. 
 Our commitment to our environment is documented in our “Environmental Management System,” which provides for continuous improvement of our efforts toward preventing pollution, complying with relevant environmental legislation and regulations and complying with customer-based environmental regulations. In addition, we maintain our own IATF 16949:2016 and ISO 14001 annual certifications, which are globally recognized quality standards for the automotive industry.
