ITEM 1. BUSINESSS
Overview

Reliant Bancorp, Inc. (f/k/a Commerce Union Bancshares, Inc.) (the “Company” or “Reliant Bancorp”), a Tennessee corporation, was incorporated on March 4, 2011, to serve as a holding company for and the sole shareholder of Reliant Bank (f/k/a Commerce Union Bank). It became the holding company of Reliant Bank upon completion of Reliant Bank’s reorganization into a holding company structure on June 6, 2012.

Reliant Bancorp is a registered financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and under the bank holding company laws of the State of Tennessee. Reliant Bank was organized in April 17, 2006, as a state chartered bank under the laws of the State of Tennessee. Reliant Bank opened for business on August 14, 2006.

Acquisitions

Commerce Union/Legacy Reliant Bank Merger

On April 1, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of legacy Reliant Bank, a Tennessee banking corporation (“Legacy Reliant Bank”). The Legacy Reliant Bank merger was accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting, in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 805-10 Business Combinations. As such, for accounting purposes, Legacy Reliant Bank was considered to be acquiring Reliant Bancorp in this transaction. As a result, the financial statements of the Company prior to the Legacy Reliant Bank merger are the historical financial statements of Legacy Reliant Bank. In periods following the Legacy Reliant Bank merger, the comparative historical financial statements of the Company are those of Legacy

Reliant Bank prior to the merger. These consolidated financial statements include the results attributable to the operations of the Company beginning on April 1, 2015.

Community First, Inc. Merger

On August 22, 2017, Reliant Bancorp entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Community First, Inc. (“Community First”), Pioneer Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliant Bancorp, Reliant Bank, and Community First Bank & Trust, a Tennessee-chartered commercial bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Community First (“Community First Bank”). On January 1, 2018, Reliant Bancorp completed the acquisition of Community First and Community First Bank and issued approximately 2,416,444 shares of Reliant Bancorp common stock valued at approximately $62.0 million to shareholders of Community First. All of Community First’s outstanding restricted share awards became fully vested and were cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the merger consideration.
Target Markets

Reliant Bancorp, through its subsidiary Reliant Bank, provides a full range of traditional banking products and services throughout the Middle Tennessee Region and the Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro-Franklin, TN Metropolitan Statistical Area (the “Nashville MSA”). In October 2018, Reliant Bank opened a full service branch office in Chattanooga, Tennessee. At the same time, Reliant Bank closed its Chattanooga commercial loan and deposit production office and consolidated the operations of this commercial loan and deposit production office into the new full service Chattanooga branch. Based on the deposit market share data published by the FDIC as of June 30, 2018, the latest available date, Reliant Bank is ranked the 11th largest bank in the Nashville MSA. Reliant Bank primarily markets its services to small businesses and residents within its markets. Reliant Bank operates its main office and sixteen branches in Davidson, Hickman, Hamilton, Maury, Robertson, Rutherford, Sumner, and Williamson counties in Tennessee. Additionally, Reliant Bank operates mortgage production offices in Brentwood and Hendersonville, Tennessee.
Employees

As of December 31, 2018, Reliant Bancorp and Reliant Bank had 263 employees on a full-time or part-time basis. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. Reliant Bancorp believes that its relationship with its employees is good. Reliant Bank employs seasoned banking professionals with experience in its market areas and who are active in their communities.
Products and Services Overview

Reliant Bank is a full-service community bank. Its principal business is banking, consisting of lending and deposit gathering from (as well as other banking-related products and services) businesses and individuals within the communities it serves, and the operational support to deliver, fund and manage such banking services. Reliant Bank provides a wide range of commercial banking services for businesses and individuals, including checking, savings, and money market deposit accounts, certificates of deposit and consumer, commercial and real estate loans. Reliant Bank’s profitability is dependent on responsible lending with strong focus on lending standards to help ensure long-term growth in assets, loans, deposits and net income in a manner consistent with safe, sound and prudent banking practices. To achieve this goal, Reliant Bank’s strategy is to: (1) expand loans and deposits through organic market share growth and strategic acquisitions; (2) provide customers with a breadth of products and financial services; (3) employ, empower and motivate management to provide personalized customer service, consistent with the best traditions of community banking, while maximizing profits; and (4) maintain asset quality and control overhead expense.

Reliant Bank provides a variety of loans, deposits and related services to its business customers. Such services include but are not limited to business checking, deposit products and services, business loans, and lines of credit. Reliant Bank offers similar services to its consumer customers, including but not limited to personal loans, checking accounts, residential mortgage loans and mortgage refinancing, safe deposit boxes, debit cards, direct deposit, and official bank checks.

Competition

Reliant Bank has substantial competition in attracting and retaining deposits and making loans to its customers in all of its principal markets. We face competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and have more financial resources than we do. Such competitors primarily include national, regional, and internet banks, in addition to other community banks that seek to offer service levels similar to ours. We also face competition from many others types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans associations, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other financial intermediaries.

The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms, and insurance companies can operate as affiliates under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting), and merchant banking services. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our non-bank competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can. Finally, as a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in late 2017, our competitors may choose to offer lower interest rates and pay higher deposit rates than we do.

We believe that we successfully compete with larger banks and other community banks in our target markets by focusing on personal service and financial products to meets the needs of the businesses and consumers in those markets.

Supervision and Regulation

Reliant Bancorp, Inc.

Reliant Bancorp owns 100% of the stock of Reliant Bank, and, therefore, we are considered a bank holding company as that term is defined under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “Bank Holding Company Act”). Additionally, we have elected under the Bank Holding Company Act to be treated as a financial holding company. As a financial holding company, we are primarily subject to supervision and examination by and the reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve, under the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Moreover, as the holding company for a bank chartered in Tennessee, we also are subject to the Tennessee Banking Act.
Subject to certain exceptions, the Bank Holding Company Act generally prohibits a bank holding company from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting stock of any company engaged in non-banking activities. An exception to this prohibition is for activities expressly found by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Financial holding companies, however, are allowed to engage without prior Federal Reserve approval in a broader range of banking and non-banking activities that are deemed to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. These “financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; organizing, sponsoring and managing mutual funds; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking. In order for a bank holding company to make a declaration to be considered a financial holding company, the bank holding company and its subsidiary depository institutions must be “well capitalized” and “well managed.” 
As a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company, Reliant Bancorp is required to file semi-annual reports with the Federal Reserve together with any additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve may, and does, also examine Reliant Bancorp.
6

Bank and financial holding companies are required to act as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support each such subsidiary. This support may be required at times when a holding company may not be able to provide such support. In the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC-as a result of default of a banking subsidiary of Reliant Bancorp or related to FDIC assistance provided to a banking subsidiary in danger of default-the other banking subsidiaries of Reliant Bancorp, if any, may be assessed for the FDIC’s loss, subject to certain exceptions.
Regulation Y of the Rules and Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors requires persons acting directly or indirectly or in concert with one or more other persons to give the Federal Reserve 60 days’ prior written notice before acquiring control of a bank or financial holding company. Under the regulation, control is defined as the ownership of or control with the power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank or financial holding company. The regulation also provides for a presumption of control if a person owns, controls, or holds with the power to vote 10% or more (but less than 25%) of any class of voting securities of a bank or financial holding company and either the company has securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act or no other person owns a greater percentage of that class of voting securities.

Payment of Dividends

Reliant Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from Reliant Bank. Because Reliant Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from Reliant Bank and does not conduct stand-alone operations, our ability to pay dividends depends on the ability of Reliant Bank to pay dividends to us, which is subject to regulatory restrictions. The principal source of Reliant Bancorp’s cash flow, including cash flow to pay interest to the holders of its trust preferred securities and dividends to holders of its common stock, is dividends that Reliant Bank pays to Reliant Bancorp as its sole shareholder. Under Tennessee law, Reliant Bancorp is not permitted to pay dividends if, after giving effect to the payment of the dividends, it would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if it were dissolving. In addition, in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size, Reliant Bancorp’s board of directors must consider its and Reliant Bank’s current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs.
Additionally, various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval. The payment of dividends by any bank also may be affected by numerous other factors, such as the maintenance of adequate capital for the bank. In addition to the foregoing restrictions, the Federal Reserve has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve’s view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or that could only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company’s financial health, such as by borrowing. Furthermore, the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (the “TDFI”) also has authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by a Tennessee chartered bank when it determines such payment of dividends to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. In the event an insured Federal Reserve-member bank controlled by a bank or financial holding company is “significantly undercapitalized” under the applicable federal bank capital ratios, or if the bank subsidiary is “undercapitalized” and has failed to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or has materially failed to implement such a plan, the Federal Reserve may require prior approval for any capital distribution by the bank or financial holding company. 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, Reliant Bancorp declared dividends totaling $0.33 per share on outstanding shares of its common stock for a total of $3,945 in aggregate dividend declarations for year. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, is subject to our board’s discretion and our compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory guidance, and will depend on our earnings, capital position, financial condition and other factors, including new regulatory capital requirements, as they become known to us.
Other Restrictions

A bank or financial holding company and its subsidiaries are also prohibited from acquiring any voting shares of, or interest in, any banks located outside of the state in which the operations of the bank holding company’s subsidiaries are located, unless the bank holding company and its subsidiaries are well-capitalized and well-managed. Further, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with the extension of credit or provision of any property or service. An affiliate of a bank holding company may not extend credit, lease, sell property, or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these items on the condition that (i) the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit, property or services from or to its bank holding company or subsidiaries thereof or (ii) the customer may not obtain some other credit, lease, property, or services from a competitor, except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended.

In approving acquisitions by bank or financial holding companies of banks and certain other non-bank companies, the Federal Reserve considers a number of factors, including expected benefits to the public such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, as weighed against the risks of possible adverse effects such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve is also empowered to differentiate between new activities and activities commenced through the acquisition of a going concern.
The Attorney General of the United States may, within 30 days after approval by the Federal Reserve of an acquisition involving a bank or financial holding company, bring an action challenging such acquisition under the federal antitrust laws, in which case the effectiveness of such approval is stayed pending a final ruling by the courts. Failure of the Attorney General to challenge an acquisition does not, however, exempt the bank or financial holding company from complying with both state and federal antitrust laws after the acquisition is consummated or immunize the acquisition from future challenge under the anti-monopoly provisions of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

Capital Guidelines

Federal banking regulators have implemented risk-based capital guidelines for bank and financial holding companies and insured depository institutions. 
In July 2013, in response to the statutory requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), federal banking regulators adopted regulations implementing the Basel Capital Adequacy Accord (“Basel III”), which had been approved by the Basel member central bank governors in 2010 as an agreement among the countries’ central banks and bank regulators on the amount of capital banks must hold as a cushion against losses and insolvency. These regulations provide for the following minimum capital to risk-weighted assets requirements in order for an institution to be considered “adequately capitalized”: a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, and a total capital ratio of 8.0%. Additionally, to be considered “adequately capitalized,” an institution must have a leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) of at least 4.0%. In order to be considered “well capitalized,” an institution must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%, a total capital ratio of 10.0%, and a leverage ratio of 5.0%. The regulations also changed the definition of capital, mainly by adopting stricter eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, and new constraints on the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets (“MSAs”), deferred tax assets (“DTAs”), and certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. In addition, the regulations require that most regulatory capital deductions be made from common equity Tier 1 capital. 
Under Basel III, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer composed of common equity Tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer is measured relative to risk-weighted assets. The capital conservation buffer was phased in starting January 1, 2016, and it became fully phased in on January 1, 2019. A banking organization with a buffer greater than 2.5% is not subject to limits on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments. A banking organization with a buffer of less than 2.5% is subject to increasingly stringent limitations as the buffer approaches zero. The regulation also prohibits a banking organization from making distributions or discretionary bonus payments during any quarter if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5% at the beginning of the quarter. The eligible retained income of a banking organization is defined as its net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the organization’s quarterly regulatory reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income. The minimum capital requirements plus the capital conservation buffer exceed the current prompt corrective action (PCA) well-capitalized thresholds.
Under Basel III, certain DTAs arising from temporary differences, MSAs, and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock are each subject to an individual limit of 10% of common equity Tier 1 capital elements and are subject to an aggregate limit of 15% of common equity Tier 1 capital elements. The amount of these items in excess of the 10% and 15% thresholds are to be deducted from common equity Tier 1 capital. Amounts of MSAs, DTAs, and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions that are not deducted due to the aforementioned 10% and 15% thresholds must be assigned a 250% risk weight. Finally, the regulations increase the risk weights for past-due loans, certain commercial real estate loans, and some equity exposures, and make selected other changes in risk weights and credit conversion factors.
Basel III took effect on January 1, 2015, whereas the capital conservation buffer and the deductions from common equity Tier 1 capital were phased in over time. Similarly, non-qualifying capital instruments were phased out over time, except as described above. Most existing non-qualifying capital instruments issued by community banks before May 19, 2010, such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock, continue to count as regulatory capital.
8

The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”) enacted on May 24, 2018, requires federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for banks and holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion and an appropriate risk profile. The required regulations must specify a minimum community bank leverage ratio of not less than 8% and not more than 10%, as well as procedures for treatment of a qualifying community bank that has a community bank leverage ratio that falls below the required minimum. Qualifying banks that exceed the minimum community bank leverage ratio will be exempt from Basel III capital rules and deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements.
On November 21, 2018, pursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing a community bank leverage ratio of 9%. The comment period for the proposed rule has since closed and the regulation is not yet finalized. The final community bank ratio is not known at this time.
Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a financial institution could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to state and federal regulatory authorities, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits, and other restrictions on its business.
Tennessee Banking Act; Federal Deposit Insurance Act

Reliant Bank is incorporated under the laws of the State of Tennessee and is subject to the applicable provisions of the laws of the State of Tennessee, including state corporate and banking laws. Reliant Bank is subject to the supervision of and regular examination by the TDFI. Reliant Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve and, therefore, is subject to Federal Reserve regulations and policies and is subject to regular examination by the Federal Reserve. Reliant Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), and Reliant Bank is, therefore, subject to the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”).
The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system for insured depository institutions that takes into account the risks attributable to different categories and concentrations of assets and liabilities. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC was required to adopt regulations that would base deposit insurance assessments on total assets less capital rather than deposit liabilities and to include off-balance sheet liabilities of institutions and their affiliates in risk-based assessments. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (“EESA”) provided for a temporary increase in the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor. This increased level of basic deposit insurance was made permanent by the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, on October 14, 2008, the FDIC instituted temporary unlimited FDIC coverage of non-interest-bearing deposit transaction accounts, but this extra coverage expired December 31, 2012. The Dodd-Frank Act also repealed the prohibition on paying interest on demand transaction accounts, but did not extend unlimited insurance protection for these accounts.
The FDIC may terminate its insurance of deposits if it finds that a financial institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a federal bank regulatory agency.
Tennessee statutes and federal law regulate a variety of the banking activities of Reliant Bank, including required reserves, investments, loans, mergers and acquisitions, issuances of securities, payments of dividends, and the establishment of branches. There are certain limitations under federal and Tennessee law on the payment of dividends by banks or bank or financial holding companies. A state bank, with the approval of the TDFI, may transfer funds from its surplus account to the undivided profits (retained earnings) account or any part of its paid-in-capital account. The payment of dividends by any bank is dependent upon its earnings and financial condition and, in addition to the limitations referred to above, is subject to the statutory power of certain federal and state regulatory agencies to act to prevent what they deem unsafe or unsound banking practices. The payment of dividends by Reliant Bank could, depending upon the bank’s financial condition, be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice. Also, without regulatory approval, a dividend only can be paid in one year to the extent of the net income of the bank for that year plus the net income of the prior two years. The FDIA prohibits a state bank, the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC, from paying dividends if it is in default in the payment of any assessments due the FDIC.
State banks also are subject to regulation respecting the maintenance of certain minimum capital levels (described above), and Reliant Bank is required to provide certain periodic reports and such additional information as the Tennessee Banking Act and applicable federal laws, rules, and regulations require. Reliant Bank is also subject to certain restrictions on loan amounts, interest rates, “insider” loans to officers, directors and principal shareholders, tying arrangements, privacy, transactions with affiliates, and many other matters. Strict compliance at all times with state and federal banking laws is required.
Tennessee law contains limitations on the interest rates that may be charged by banks on various types of loans and restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be granted and on the types of investments that may be made by banks. The operations 
9

of banks are also affected by various consumer laws and regulations, including those relating to equal credit opportunity and regulation of consumer lending practices. All Tennessee banks must become and remain insured banks under the FDIA.
Under Tennessee law, a state bank is prohibited from lending to any one person, firm, or corporation amounts more than 15% of its equity capital accounts, except (i) in the case of certain loans secured by negotiable title documents covering readily marketable nonperishable staples or (ii) that the bank may make a loan to one person, firm or corporation in an amount up to 25% of its equity capital accounts with the prior written approval of the bank’s board of directors.
Community Reinvestment Act
The Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”), first enacted by Congress in 1977 and amended from time to time thereafter, requires that each depository institution’s record of helping meet the needs of its entire community be evaluated by the depository institution’s primary federal regulator. The CRA helps assure that banks and other financial institutions make credit available to low- and moderate-income borrowers, consistent with safe and sound operations. These regulations provide for a regular assessment of a bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of its service area. Federal banking agencies are required to make public a rating of a bank’s performance under the CRA. The federal banking agencies consider a bank’s CRA rating when a bank submits an application to establish banking centers, merge, or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank. In the case of an application by a bank or financial holding company for approval of a merger or acquisition, the CRA performance record of all banks involved in the merger or acquisition are reviewed in connection with the application filing. An unsatisfactory record of CRA performance can substantially delay, block or result in the imposition of conditions in connection with expansionary activities. Reliant Bank’s last CRA performance evaluation was in October 2016, and Reliant Bank was assigned a rating of “Satisfactory.”
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) substantially revised the depository institution regulatory and funding provisions of the FDIA, and revised several other federal banking statutes. Among other things, FDICIA requires the federal banking regulators to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA established five capital tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” Under currently applicable prompt corrective action regulations, an FDIC-insured depository institution is defined to be well capitalized if (i) it maintains a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and (ii) it is not subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. An FDIC-insured depository institution is defined to be adequately capitalized if it maintains a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%. An-FDIC insured depository institution is defined to be undercapitalized if it has a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of less than 4%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, or a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%. An-FDIC insured depository institution is defined to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of less than 3%, a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, or a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%. An institution is considered critically undercapitalized if fails to maintain tangible equity to total assets of greater than 2%. An insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating.
The capital-based prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA and their implementing regulations apply to FDIC-insured depository institutions and are not directly applicable to the holding companies that control those institutions. However, the Federal Reserve has indicated that, in regulating bank and financial holding companies, it will take appropriate action at the holding company level based on an assessment of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary depository institutions pursuant to these provisions and regulations.
FDICIA generally prohibits an FDIC-insured depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payments of dividends) or paying any management fee to its holding company (if any) if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. A depository institution’s holding company must guarantee the capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution’s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable capital plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized.
10

These levels will differ for community banks such as Reliant Bank who qualify for and elect to use the new community bank leverage ratio pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Relief Act. The Regulatory Relief Act requires federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for banks and holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion and an appropriate risk profile. The required regulations must specify a minimum community bank leverage ratio of not less than 8% and not more than 10%, as well as procedures for treatment of a qualifying community bank that has a community bank leverage ratio that falls below the required minimum. Qualifying banks that exceed the minimum community bank leverage ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements.
On November 21, 2018, pursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing a community bank leverage ratio of 9% and corresponding capital adequacy levels. As proposed, a community bank with a community bank leverage ratio of greater than 9% would be considered “well capitalized;” a community bank with a community bank leverage ratio of 7.5% or greater would be considered “adequately capitalized;” a community bank with a community bank leverage ratio of less than 7.5% would be considered “undercapitalized;” and a community bank with a community bank leverage ratio of less than 6% would be considered “significantly undercapitalized” and would be required to provide its primary regulator with additional information in order to determine whether such organization would be classified as “critically undercapitalized.” The comment period for the proposed rule has since closed, but the regulation is not yet finalized. 
Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator generally within 90 days of the date on which they became critically undercapitalized.
The FDIC has adopted regulations under FDICIA governing the receipt of brokered deposits and pass-through insurance. Under the regulations, a bank cannot accept, roll over or renew brokered deposits unless it is well-capitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that cannot receive brokered deposits also cannot offer “pass-through” insurance on certain employee benefit accounts. Whether or not it has obtained this waiver, an adequately capitalized bank may not pay an interest rate on any deposits in excess of 75 basis points over certain index prevailing market rates specified by regulation. There are no such restrictions on a bank that is well-capitalized.
FDICIA contains numerous other provisions, including accounting, audit and reporting requirements, termination of the “too big to fail” doctrine except in special cases, limitations on the FDIC’s payment of deposits at foreign branches, new regulatory standards in such areas as asset quality, earnings and compensation and revised regulatory standards for, among other things, powers of state banks, real estate lending and capital adequacy. FDICIA also requires that a depository institution provide 90 days prior notice of the closing of any branches.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act

In 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) expanded the universe of activities in which bank holding companies and affiliates of banks are permitted to engage, especially in the areas of securities and insurance. This law also includes requirements regarding the privacy and protection of non-public customer information held by financial institutions, as well as many other providers of financial services. There are provisions providing for functional regulation of the various services provided by institutions among different regulators. GLBA codified the “safeguards rule” which requires financial institutions to develop a written information security plan that describes how the company is prepared for and plans to continue to protect customers’ and consumers’ non-public personal information. GLBA did not remove the restrictions in the Bank Holding Company Act that prevent non-financial companies from entering retail and/or commercial banking. Finally, among many other sections of this law, there is some relief for small banks from the regulatory burden of the Community Reinvestment Act.

Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act

The Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, better known as the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), requires all United States financial institutions to assist United States government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering. Specifically, BSA requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments; file reports of cash transactions exceeding a daily aggregate amount of $10,000; to report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities; and to obtain and retain information regarding the identify and verification of the beneficial owners of business customers. 
The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA PATRIOT Act”) substantially broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction 
11

of the United States, imposed new compliance and due diligence obligations, defined new crimes and penalties, compelled the production of documents located both inside and outside the United States, including those of foreign institutions that have a correspondent relationship in the United States, and clarified the safe harbor from civil liability to customers. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions such as Reliant Bank. The regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. 
Under the USA PATRIOT Act, all “financial institutions” (as therein defined) must establish anti-money laundering compliance and due diligence programs. Such programs must include, among other things, adequate policies, the designation of a compliance officer, employee and director training programs, an independent audit function to review and test the program, and the ongoing due diligence and monitoring of customer relationships including the beneficial owners of business customers.
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 

In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, incorporating numerous financial institution regulatory reforms. Many of these reforms were implemented between 2011 and 2014 through regulations promulgated by banking and securities regulators. The following discussion describes certain material elements of the regulatory framework. Many of the Dodd-Frank Act provisions are stated to only apply to larger financial institutions and do not directly impact community-based institutions like Reliant Bank. For instance, provisions that regulate derivative transactions and limit derivatives trading activity of federally-insured institutions, enhance supervision of “systemically significant” institutions, impose new regulatory authority over hedge funds, limit proprietary trading by banks, and phase-out the eligibility of trust preferred securities for Tier 1 capital are among the provisions that do not directly impact Reliant Bank either because of exemptions for institutions below a certain asset size or because of the nature of our bank’s operations. Other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that impact Reliant Bank include provisions that:

• | Change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital, eliminate the ceiling and increase the size of the floor of the DIF, and offset the impact of the increase in the minimum floor on institutions with less than $10 billion in assets.


• | Make permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance.


• | Repeal the federal prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depositing institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.


• | Centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, also known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), responsible for implementing federal consumer protection laws, although banks below $10 billion in assets continue to be examined and supervised for compliance with these laws by their primary federal bank regulator.


• | Restrict the preemption of state law by federal law and disallow national bank subsidiaries from availing themselves of such preemption.


• | Impose new requirements for mortgage lending, including new minimum underwriting standards, prohibitions on certain yield-spread compensation to mortgage originators, special consumer protections for mortgage loans that do not meet certain provision qualifications, prohibitions and limitations on certain mortgage terms and various new mandated disclosures to mortgage borrowers.


• | Apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to bank and financial holding companies.


• | Permit national and state banks to establish de novo interstate branches at any location where a bank based in that state could establish a branch, and require that bank and financial holding companies and banks be well-capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state.


• | Impose new limits on affiliated transactions and cause derivative transactions to be subject to lending limits.


• | Implement corporate governance revisions, including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access to shareholders that apply to all public companies not just financial institutions.

The Dodd-Frank Act has increased regulatory burdens, compliance costs, and non-interest expense for community banks. Of particular concern to many community banks is the depth and breadth of the powers of the CFPB, which may have significant impacts on consumer compliance regulation and increased costs, particularly for smaller depository institutions.
Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act 
The Regulatory Relief Act was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While it maintains the majority of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Regulatory Relief Act amends certain aspects for small depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as Reliant Bank. Sections in the Regulatory Relief Act address access to mortgage credit; consumer access to credit; protections for veterans, consumers, and homeowners; rules for certain bank or financial holding companies; capital access; and protections for student borrowers. Reliant Bancorp and Reliant Bank will focus on the implementing rules and guidance for the various provisions in each section of the Regulatory Relief Act that impact their operations and activities.
Among other items, the Regulatory Relief Act simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. The Regulatory Relief Act requires federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for banks and holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion and an appropriate risk profile. The required regulations must specify a minimum community bank leverage ratio of not less than 8% and not more than 10%, as well as procedures for treatment of a qualifying community bank that has a community bank leverage ratio that falls below the required minimum. Qualifying banks that exceed the minimum community bank leverage ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements.
On November 21, 2018, pursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing a community bank leverage ratio of 9%. The comment period for the proposed rule has since closed, but the regulation is not yet finalized. The final community bank ratio is not known at this time. 
The Regulatory Relief Act also expands the universe of holding companies that are permitted to rely on the “Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement.” The asset size of a qualifying holding company was increased from $1 billion to $3 billion on August 30, 2018, thus excluding holding companies in this category from consolidated capital requirements. However, subsidiary depository institutions continue to be subject to minimum capital requirements. 
Further, the Regulatory Relief Act decreased the burden for community banks in regards to call reports, the Volcker Rule (which generally restricts banks from engaging in certain investment activities and limits involvement with hedge funds and private equity firms), mortgage disclosures, and risk weights for some high-risk commercial real estate loans. On December 28, 2018, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule increasing the asset threshold to qualify for an 18-month examination cycle from $1 billion to $3 billion for qualifying institutions that are well capitalized, well managed and meet certain other requirements. 
Any number of the provisions of the Regulatory Relief Act may have the effect of increasing our expenses, decreasing our revenues, or changing the activities in which we chooses to engage. The environment in which banking organizations operate, including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital, liquidity, supervision, permissible activities, corporate governance and compensation, changes in fiscal policy and steps to eliminate government support for banking organizations, may have long-term effects on the profitability of banking organizations that cannot now be foreseen. 
It is difficult at this time to determine the direct impact of the Regulatory Relief Act on Reliant Bancorp and Reliant Bank. Implementing rules and regulations are required and many have not yet been written or finalized.
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012
The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”) increased the threshold under which a bank or bank holding company may terminate registration of a security under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to 1,200 shareholders of record from 300. The JOBS Act also raised from 500 to 2,000 the number of “record” shareholders of a class of equity securities that triggers the requirements for an issuer to register that class of securities and become a public reporting company. Since the JOBS Act was signed, numerous banks and bank holding companies have filed to deregister their common stock.
Current Expected Credit Loss 
A new accounting standard changing the current method for providing allowances for loan and lease losses has been adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. This new standard is referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) and 
13

becomes effective for Reliant Bank in 2021. The use of this standard will increase the types of data required to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses. 
The use of this standard may potentially increase Reliant Bank’s allowance for loan and lease losses. Any increase in Reliant Bank’s allowance for loan and lease losses or expenses incurred in order to make the determination for such allowance could have a material adverse effect on Reliant Bank’s financial condition and results of operations. The direct effects on Reliant Bank are not yet known.
Other Regulations
Interest and other charges that Reliant Bank collects or contracts for are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Reliant Bank’s loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as:

• | The federal Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;


• | The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the communities it serves;


• | The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;


• | The Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;


• | The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing debt collection practices; and


• | The rules and regulations of the various governmental agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws.

In addition, Reliant Bank’s deposit operations are subject to the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve to implement that act, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services.

FDIC Insurance Premiums

Reliant Bank is required to pay quarterly FDIC deposit insurance assessments to the DIF. The FDIC merged the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund to form the DIF on March 31, 2006, in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The amount each institution is assessed is based on the institution’s average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period as well as the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund. The FDIC uses a risk-based premium system that assesses higher rates on those institutions that pose greater risks to the DIF.
The FDIC has a risk-based assessment system to adjust the risk-based calculation of an institution’s unsecured debt, secured liabilities and brokered deposits. On November 12, 2009, the FDIC announced a final rule to increase by 3 basis points the deposit assessment base rate, beginning January 1, 2011. Effective July 1, 2016, the initial base assessment rates for all insured institutions were reduced from 5 to 35 basis points to 3 to 30 basis points. Pursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, the FDIC Board of Directors authorized the publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to apply the community bank leverage ratio framework to the deposit insurance assessment system. While an assessment estimator is available for use in determining the impact of the proposal on Reliant Bank, the regulation is not yet finalized and changes could be made. 
Any future deposit insurance premium increases will adversely impact Reliant Bank’s earnings. Depending on any future losses that the FDIC insurance fund may suffer due to failed institutions, there can be no assurance that there will not be additional significant premium increases in order to replenish the fund.
Under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by a federal bank regulatory agency.
Effects of Governmental Policies
14


Reliant Bank’s earnings are affected by the difference between the interest earned by Reliant Bank on its loans and investments and the interest paid by Reliant Bank on its deposits or other borrowings. The yields on its assets and the rates paid on its liabilities are sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest. Thus, the earnings and growth of Reliant Bank are influenced by general economic conditions, fiscal policies of the federal government, and the policies of regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve, which establishes national monetary policy. The nature and impact of any future changes in fiscal or monetary policies cannot be predicted.
Commercial banks are affected by the credit policy of various regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in reserve requirements on bank deposits, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and limitations on interest rates that banks may pay on time and savings deposits. The Federal Reserve uses these means in varying combinations to influence overall growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also to affect interest rates charged on loans, received on investments or paid for deposits.
The monetary and fiscal policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve, also affect the banking industry. Through changes in the reserve requirements against bank deposits, open market operations in U.S. Government securities and changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings, the Federal Reserve influences the cost and availability of funds obtained for lending and investing. No prediction can be made with respect to possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels or loan demand or with respect to the impact of such changes on the business and earnings of Reliant Bank.
From time to time, legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities, or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. With the enactments of EESA, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, CECL and the significant number of regulations that have or will be promulgated under these and other laws affecting financial institutions, the nature and extent of the future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions, and the resulting impact on those institutions is and will be unpredictable. Bills are currently pending which may have the effect of changing the way Reliant Bancorp and/or Reliant Bank conducts its business.
