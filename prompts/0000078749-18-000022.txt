History and Significant Events
Organized in 1963 as Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., an Ohio corporation, we began operations as a distributor of electronic components and, later, enterprise computer solutions. Exiting the former in fiscal 2003 with the sale of our Industrial Electronic Division, we used the proceeds to reduce debt, fund growth of our enterprise solutions business. This included acquiring businesses focused on higher-margin and more specialized solutions for the hospitality and retail industries. At the same time, we changed our name to Agilysys, Inc.
In fiscal 2004, we acquired Inter-American Data, Inc., which allowed us to become the leading developer and provider of technology solutions for property and inventory management in the casino and resort industries.
In fiscal 2007, we exited the enterprise computer distribution business. We used the proceeds from that sale to return cash to shareholders and fund a number of acquisitions that broadened our solutions and capabilities portfolios. We acquired InfoGenesis, Inc., Visual One Systems Corp. and Eatec Corporation in fiscal 2008, significantly expanding our specialized offerings to the hospitality industry through enterprise-class POS, PMS and inventory and procurement software solutions tailored for a variety of applications in cruise, golf, spa, gaming, lodging, resort, and catering. These offerings feature highly intuitive, secure and robust solutions, easily scalable across multiple departments or property locations. 
In fiscal 2012, we sold our remaining enterprise computer solutions business and restructured our business model to focus on higher-margin, profitable growth opportunities in the hospitality and retail sectors. We also reduced our real-estate footprint and lowered overhead costs by relocating corporate services from Solon, Ohio to Alpharetta, Georgia, thus moving our senior management team closer to our operating units.

In fiscal 2014, we sold our retail solutions and services business to Kyrus Solutions, Inc. (Kyrus), an affiliate of Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. Following completion of the transaction, our business focused exclusively on hospitality solutions and the growth opportunities in the hospitality market.
In fiscal year 2018, we opened an India development center in Chennai, India, to supplement our product development efforts.
Today, we are focused on providing state-of-the-art, end-to-end solutions that enhance guest experiences and allow our customers to promote their respective brands. We help our customers win the guest recruitment battle and, in turn, grow revenue, reduce costs and increase efficiency. This is accomplished by developing and deploying innovative solutions that increase speed and accuracy, integrate with other enterprise systems and create a common infrastructure for managing guest data thereby enabling more effective management, intelligent upselling, reduced shrinkage, improved brand recognition and better control of the customer relationship. Our strategy is to increase the proportion of revenue we derive from ongoing support and maintenance agreements, software as a subscription service, cloud applications and professional services.

Products: 
The hospitality industry has long been focused on operating end-to-end businesses, but the technology vendors that service the industry have been focused on product-centric solutions that make use of a high number of software modules and operating silos. To resolve this disconnect and more effectively align with the business operations of our customers, we have evolved our approach to be focused on delivering integrated "platform-centric” solutions for Lodging, Food & Beverage and Payments applications through an investment in the development of a web services oriented architecture enterprise platform. Our rGuest™ platform is aimed at transitioning our product and services offerings to better address the needs of hospitality operators as they focus on building better connections with guests, pre-, during and post-visit. The rGuest platform facilitates an end-to-end solution that helps our customers improve the guest experience, increase top-line performance and reduce operating costs, which leads to opportunities for higher profitability. Our next-generation of products and services are aimed at helping hospitality operators recruit customers into their facilities, increase their wallet share from each customer and improve the overall guest experience from the initial customer touch point through post-visit interactions.

The rGuest hospitality platform underlies our industry leading solutions that are being introduced to operators of all sizes and with varying needs. The rGuest Software as a Service (“SaaS”)-based platform is designed to run on the public cloud, private cloud, on-premise, or in a hybrid configuration where the infrastructure may be above premise but the data can reside on premise. rGuest’s flexible architecture scales seamlessly to meet the needs of multi-property customers as well as for a single property.
The rGuest hospitality platform helps operators more efficiently manage their business and grow their sales by:

• | Identifying the most valuable data and determining how best to use it;


• | Empowering users to be capable of both working with new technologies and of interpreting the data to find meaningful business insights;

Industry and Markets
We offer innovative solutions and services for point-of-sale (POS), payment gateway, reservation and table management, property management (PMS), inventory and procurement, business analytics, document management, guest offers management, and mobile and wireless solutions exclusively to the hospitality industry. We serve four major market sectors: Gaming, both corporate and tribal; Hotels, Resorts and Cruise; Corporate Foodservice Management; and Restaurants, Universities, Stadia and Healthcare.
The hospitality industry encompasses a wide variety of market sectors and customers. We operate throughout North America, Europe and Asia, with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA. Sales to customers outside of the United States represent approximately 5% of total sales.
The hospitality industry is highly fragmented and composed of a number of defined markets including lodging, casinos, cruise ships, resorts and spas, franchise operators, restaurant chains, stadia, and arenas among others. For example, in the lodging segment, no single hotel brand accounts for more than 4% of all hotel rooms in the United States. According to STR Global, in 2017 the U.S. hotel industry set records for supply (roughly 1.87 billion room-nights available) and demand (roughly 1.23 billion room-nights sold). Based on percentage growth for the year, demand (+2.7%) significantly outpaced supply (+1.8%), even though the supply growth figure was the largest for the industry since 2009. STR further reported that compared with 2016, US hotel occupancy increased by +0.9% to 65.9%, average daily rate (ADR) increased by +2.1% to US$126.72, and revenue per available room (RevPAR)increased by +3.0% to US$83.57.
The hospitality business is sensitive to the strength of domestic and global economic and credit conditions. Business and destination resort travel are highly correlated with the economic conditions in their respective markets. Competition is intense for consumer spending, and hospitality industry participants are seeking ways to increase their visibility and appeal as well as enhance the experience of their guests. In its 2017 Travel and Hospitality Industry Outlook, Deloitte observed that travel companies should 
11

leverage an increased awareness of customer expectations, re-imagined technology strategy, and differentiated offerings to provide unmatched travel experiences. Our products and solutions are meant to leverage the opportunity these challenges create by providing our customers with a higher degree of guest connectivity and added engagement tools that will enable them to better capitalize on their brand equity, and more profitably manage their operations, and grow their business. In addition to product solutions that are designed and customized to meet unique facility or multi-facility needs, we also provide an array of support and subscription options geared towards maintaining systems and professional services for implementation and rollouts.
We have a significant customer base in the commercial casino and gaming sector. According to CPA firm Rubin Brown's Gaming Services Group, US Gaming industry annual revenues grew to nearly $76 billion in 2017, as compared to approximately $73 billion in 2016. Amenities in contemporary casinos extend well beyond gaming to include a variety of entertainment and leisure options as well as modern convention centers and meeting facilities to attract the corporate market. International gaming markets are growing rapidly both in size and new jurisdictions. Asian gaming markets continue to generate robust growth. Gross gaming revenue in Macau exceeds that of the Las Vegas Strip, with a number of the current and planned properties in the region operated by U.S.-based companies. As the market share leader in providing PMS systems to casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, we are well positioned to benefit from these strong and long-standing relationships as our customer base expands into international markets. Additionally, as gaming operators migrate toward cashless operations, optimization of non-gaming spend and digital track-and-log of unique guest behavior, we are able to provide the requisite technologies and expertise to satisfy their needs.
We also have expertise in serving the unique needs of Cruise ship operators. Guests and potential customers are expecting an experience that reflects their unique tastes, preferences and travel habits, and cruise operators have seen the need to adequately support the increasing level of personalization and detail required to capture the highest level of guest satisfaction. Our products and services are designed to best help them deliver on this critical part of their business. According to the Cruise Lines International Association and Cruise Market Watch 2018, cruise lines continued the growth trends of recent years in 2017. The worldwide cruise ship fleet currently stands at 365 ships and the current order book includes 106 new ships to be delivered by 2027. The industry carried an estimated 25.2 million passengers in 2017, up from nearly 24.2 million passengers in 2016.
Customers
Our customers include large, medium-sized and boutique companies, both owned and franchised, as well as divisions or departments of large corporations in the hospitality industry. We concentrate on serving the needs of customers in a range of customer-focused settings where brand differentiation is important, particularly in the lodging, casino, destination resort, cruise line, foodservice industries where competition for guest recruitment is intense. Our current customer base is highly fragmented, with the exception of one customer representing 10% of consolidated revenue for the year ended March 31, 2017.
Seasonality
We have traditionally experienced seasonal revenue weakness during our fiscal first quarter ending June 30. Additionally, the timing of large one-time orders, such as those associated with significant remarketed product sales around large customer refresh cycles or significant volume rollouts, occasionally creates volatility in our quarterly results.
Competition
Our solutions face a highly competitive market. Competition exists with respect to developing and maintaining relationships with customers, pricing for products and solutions, and customer support and service. 
We compete with other full-service providers that sell and service bundled POS and PMS solutions comprised of hardware, software, support and services. These companies, some of which are much larger than we are, include Oracle Corp., NCR, Constellation Software, Inc., Amadeus IT Group and Infor. We also compete with software companies like Vivonet, POSitouch, Northwind and Appetize Technologies. In addition, we compete with PMS systems that are designed and maintained in-house by large hotel chains.
Environmental Matters
We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws. Presently, we do not anticipate that such compliance will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations. 
Employees
12

As of May 21, 2018, we had 841 employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements, have had no strikes or work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
