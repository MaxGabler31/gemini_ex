Overview
 
Lindblad provides expedition cruising and land-based adventure travel experiences that foster a spirit of exploration and discovery using itineraries that feature up-close encounters with wildlife, nature, history and culture, and promote guest empowerment, human connections and interactivity. Our mission is offering life-changing adventures around the world and pioneering innovative ways to allow our guests to connect with exotic and remote places. Our brands include Lindblad Expeditions, Natural Habitat, Inc. (“Natural Habitat”), DuVine Cycling + Adventure Company (“DuVine”), Off the Beaten Path, LLC (“Off the Beaten Path”) and Classic Journeys, LLC (“Classic Journeys”).
Segments
 
Lindblad Segment
 
The Lindblad segment consists primarily of ship-based expeditions aboard customized, nimble and intimately-scaled vessels that are able to venture where larger cruise ships cannot, thereby allowing Lindblad to offer up-close experiences in the planet’s wild and remote places and capitals of culture. Many of these expeditions involve travel to remote places with limited infrastructure and ports, such as Antarctica and the Arctic, or places that are best accessed by a ship, such as the Galápagos Islands, Alaska and Baja California’s Sea of Cortez and foster active engagement by guests. Each expedition ship also is fully equipped with state-of-the-art tools for in-depth exploration.
 
We choose to visit geographic areas based upon many factors, including weather, marine conditions, migration patterns and various natural phenomena and are continually expanding our travel offerings. In the northern hemisphere summer months, we primarily visit the High Arctic regions of the world, Alaska, the Canadian Maritimes, Europe, as well as the South Pacific, and in the northern hemisphere winter months, we primarily travel to Antarctica, South America, Costa Rica, Baja California and the Caribbean. The Galápagos Islands are a year-round destination offering a diverse variety of marine, land and airborne wildlife.
 
Our offerings appeal to a wide range of travelers, both individuals and families, with affluent individuals in the U.S. aged 50 years or older representing our largest demographic category. The quality of our offerings has enabled us to achieve and maintain premium pricing in the market instead of pursuing the type of discounting in which most large cruise lines that are focused on the broader market engage. Our product offering, value proposition and differentiated pricing approach have enabled us to historically achieve high net yields and occupancy rates. 
 
We have a longstanding relationship with the National Geographic Society, which was founded on a shared interest in exploration, research, technology and conservation. This relationship includes co-selling, co-marketing and branding arrangements with National Geographic Partners, LLC (“National Geographic”) whereby our owned vessels carry the National Geographic name and National Geographic sells our expeditions through their internal travel divisions. We collaborate with National Geographic on expedition planning to enhance the guest experience by having National Geographic experts, including photographers, writers, marine biologists, naturalists, field researchers and film crews, join our expeditions. Guests have the ability to interface with these experts through lectures, excursions, dining and other experiences throughout their expedition.
 
Lindblad Expeditions Ships 
 
We operate a fleet of ten owned expedition vessels, along with five seasonal chartered ships, to provide our signature marine-based adventures to over 40 destinations on all seven continents, offering itineraries that last from four to 30 days. The small size of our vessels allows them to reach places inaccessible to larger ships. They are designed with a variety of public areas that offer views for passing landscape, observing wildlife and large dining rooms and lounges that form part of the social hubs of the ships, featuring presentation space for exploration recaps. The multiple public spaces on each vessel permits the ability to social distance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, several of our ships are outfitted with state of the art broadcast centers allowing us to capture and air live video and photo content from our ships with real-time distribution across digital channels. 
 
We have extensive experience operating in the Galápagos Islands, Alaska, Antarctica and the Arctic, with the Lindblad family having been among the first to bring non-scientist travelers to these regions. We currently operate two vessels providing itineraries in the Galápagos Islands throughout the year. We operate three polar vessels that serve primarily in Antarctica during the northern hemisphere winter, in the Arctic during the northern hemisphere summer and various destinations during the intermediate months. We operate four ships in Alaska during the summer months that then travel south along the North American Pacific coastline to Baja California's Sea of Cortez, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Panama for the winter. We also operate one ship with itineraries that sail primarily in the South Pacific and Asia.
 
    2 

  

In addition to our owned and operated ships, we deploy chartered vessels for various seasonal offerings and continually seek to optimize our charter fleet to balance our inventory with demand and maximize yields. We use our charter inventory as a mechanism to both increase travel options for our existing and prospective guests and also to test demand for certain areas and seasons to understand the potential for longer term deployments and additional vessel needs. We currently charter five vessels for seasonal itineraries in the Amazon, Scotland, the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, Cambodia and Vietnam, and Egypt.
 
The following table presents summary information concerning the ships we currently operate and their primary traditional geographic operations:

 * Chartered Vessel
 
During September 2021, we acquired the Crystal Esprit yacht and have subsequently rebranded it as the National Geographic Islander II. We are currently renovating the vessel including, among other changes, expanding the expedition capabilities and modifying the capacity to accommodate 48 guests. The renovated vessel will eventually replace the National Geographic Islander later in 2022 in the Galápagos Islands.

Return to Fleet Operations and COVID-19 Business Update
 
We resumed ship operations in June 2021 and, as of January 31, 2022, had nine of our ten available vessels providing expeditions to guests. Due to the spread of the COVID-19 virus and the effects of travel restrictions around the world, we had previously suspended or rescheduled the majority of our expeditions departing between March 16, 2020 through May 31, 2021. Expedition cruise operations restarted in June 2021, with three ships in Alaska and another in the Galápagos Islands, and subsequently, we resumed operations on the majority of our remaining vessels with additional ships operating in Alaska, the Galápagos Islands, Iceland, the Pacific Northwest, Baja California’s Sea of Cortez, Central America and Antarctica. We continue to work with local authorities on plans to operate itineraries in additional geographies during 2022. As the COVID-19 virus effects travel restrictions in various locations around the world, we also continue to work with our guests to reschedule travel plans and refund payments or issue future travel certificates, as applicable, for those expeditions and trips that we are not able to operate due to local restrictions.
 
Our internal COVID-19 policy team meets daily to assess the latest in testing, vaccination and global response to COVID-19. This team, in conjunction with numerous external experts, is continually evaluating and building upon our existing robust protocols to further enhance the safety of our operations. These protocols include thorough reviews of our heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, testing protocols for guests and crew, enhanced sanitation of all spaces and other changes necessary to continue operating during the COVID-19 pandemic environment. This group also meets regularly with local authorities and health experts.
 
We believe there are a variety of strategic advantages that enable us to deploy our ships safely and mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission. The most notable is the size of our owned and operated vessels which range from 48 to 148 passengers, allowing for a highly controlled environment that includes stringent cleaning protocols. All guests, crew and staff are required to be fully vaccinated and the relatively small size of our ships allows us to efficiently and effectively test our guests and crew prior to boarding. Additionally, the majority of expeditions take place in remote locations where human interactions with persons not on the expedition are limited, so there is less opportunity for external influence. We also have the ability to be flexible with regards to existing itineraries and are continually investigating additional itinerary opportunities both internationally and domestically.

Competitive Strengths
 
Our management team believes the following characteristics of our business model enables us to successfully execute our strategy:
 
Strong Track Record, Expertise and Name Recognition

Our leadership and expertise today are built on the Lindblad family’s decades of experience in expedition adventure travel. Sven-Olof Lindblad, our Co-Chairperson of the Board of Directors and former president and chief executive officer, comes from a rich expedition heritage. The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, which was established in 1991, believes that the concept of expedition cruising, coupled with education as a major theme, began when Lars-Eric Lindblad, Sven-Olof Lindblad’s father, led the first traveler’s expedition to Antarctica in 1966. The following year, he led the first traveler’s expedition to the Galápagos Islands. Lars-Eric Lindblad has also been recognized by The New York Times, Travel + Leisure Magazine and other publications for his vision and leadership in developing what is today known as expedition travel. Believing that educated people who saw things with their own eyes would be a potent force for the preservation of the places they visited, Lars-Eric Lindblad worked to promote conservation and restoration projects worldwide. Sven-Olof Lindblad founded Lindblad in 1979, expanding the legacy of his father by providing expanded marine experiences around the world and leading innovation in the expedition adventure travel industry.
 
We pioneered expeditions in the High Arctic, Antarctica, the Galápagos Islands and Baja California’s Sea of Cortez and created what we view as the most innovative and in-depth expedition program in Alaska. We initiated the use of kayaks for active exploration in the Polar Regions and in the Galápagos Islands, a feature which is now available on all of our owned vessels to enable personal, water-level encounters with nature. We were also one of the first to develop an undersea exploration program as part of a small ship expedition utilizing state-of-the-art equipment and technology.
 
With decades of experience in the expedition adventure travel sector, we have established deep expertise and knowledge of operating expedition cruises in extreme locations. We have earned awards and honors from various representatives of the travel industry, including recognition for the quality of our offerings and our support for conservation and sustainable tourism. Some of the awards we earned during 2021 and 2020 are as follows:

When customers select an expedition provider for the types of journeys that we offer, we believe that being known as a trusted brand with extensive operating history and knowledge in the market is a significant competitive strength.
 
Compelling Experiential Offerings
 
Lindblad is known for delivering voyages that offer in-depth exploration opportunities in locations around the world. Expeditions are operated on intimately-scaled ships with capacities ranging between 28 and 148 guests, fostering a friendly atmosphere on board and extensive interaction between guests, crew and the teams of world-class scientists, naturalists, researchers and photographers that participate in the expeditions. The vessels are nimble and can access locations that are unattainable for large cruise ships, allowing for in-depth exploration itineraries and viewpoints. The ships are customized to provide our signature adventure experiences and activities, such as kayaking among Antarctic icebergs to view penguins or traveling on a Zodiac for an up-close encounter with a whale. Based on our product offerings, we are able to support premium pricing with minimal discounting and benefit from low capital expenditure requirements, minimal working capital needs and favorable tax attributes. 
 
Natural Habitat offers over 100 different expedition itineraries of primarily land-based nature adventures in more than 45 countries spanning all seven continents. Natural Habitat expeditions focus on small groups led by award-winning naturalists to achieve close-up wildlife and nature experiences. Examples of expeditions offered by Natural Habitat include safaris in Botswana, grizzly bear adventures in Alaska and polar bear tours in Canada. Many of Natural Habitat’s expeditions feature access to private wildlife reserves, remote corners of national parks and distinctive lodges and camps for the best wildlife viewing. Their expeditions average nine guests with itineraries running from six to 17 days, with an average of nine days. 
 
DuVine offers luxury cycling and adventure tours in over 50 destinations across Europe, North America, Latin America, and Africa. DuVine’s itineraries cater to riders of all abilities with a focus on culinary experiences and boutique accommodations. Guests cultivate meaningful connections across cultures, such as hopping off the bike to taste sun-warmed grapes with a Bordeaux winemaker or hand-shape orecchiette pasta with a local friend in Puglia, Italy. Excursions average six days and every tour has an opportunity to discover the character of a region thanks to well-connected local guides, small groups of 14 or fewer guests, and top-quality bikes and support.
 
Off the Beaten Path offers active small-group and private custom journeys throughout North America, Europe, Africa, Australia, Central and South America and the South Pacific. Examples of expeditions include culture and history focused experiences in the Desert Southwest, exploring nearly all of the National Parks in the U.S. and Canada, hiking through the Dolomites, enjoying a family adventure in Patagonia’s Lake District and experiencing the culture, architecture and village life of Morocco. Off the Beaten Path's adventures focus on outdoor activity, including wildlife viewing, hiking, rafting, snorkeling, kayaking and snowshoeing, and comprehensive pre-trip materials paired with experienced, friendly guides. 
 
Classic Journeys delivers hand crafted walking tours with an average of ten guests per departure and featuring expert local guides who know the most cinematic footpaths in the region. Including the vast plains of Spain studded with gnarled olive trees, wandering the historic streets of Quebec, meeting the enormous residents of a Laotian elephant preserve or floating down a rural in China on a bamboo raft past dragon-teeth mountain peaks. Guests eat like locals from gourmet picnics to world class restaurants, enjoying native food traditions and enjoy top-rated and authentic accommodations.
 
We are continuously focused on maintaining and elevating the guest experience and identifying new opportunities to help people discover the wonders of the world. We believe that our track record of high-quality expedition offerings, along with our history of providing in-depth and highly innovative itineraries, represent significant competitive advantages.
 
Strategic Alliance with National Geographic
 
We benefit from a longstanding relationship with the National Geographic, one of the world’s leading proponents of eco-tourism and natural history. The strategic alliance, which began in 2004, is built on our shared interest in education, exploration, research, storytelling, technology and conservation. Founded in 1888, the National Geographic Society is one of the largest non-profit scientific and educational institutions in the world with interests ranging from geography, archaeology and natural science, to the promotion of environmental and historical conservation. Working to inspire, illuminate and teach, National Geographic reaches hundreds of millions of people around the world through a wide range of media, including print, TV, digital and social media platforms. The National Geographic name has significant value for use in connection with travel-related goods and services. The Lindblad/National Geographic alliance includes a co-selling and co-marketing arrangement through which National Geographic promotes our offerings in its marketing campaigns across web-based, email, print and other marketing platforms and sells our expeditions through its internal travel division. We believe that the alliance with National Geographic provides us with a substantial competitive advantage in the expedition market based on the brand enhancement, expanded marketing reach and the relationship with National Geographic’s experts, including photographers, writers, marine biologists, naturalists, field researchers and film crews, join our expeditions. Guests have the ability to interface with these experts through lectures, excursions, dining and other experiences throughout their expedition. 
 
    6 

  

Through this alliance, we collaborate with National Geographic on exploration, research, technology and conservation in order to provide travel experiences and disseminate geographic knowledge around the globe. The Lindblad/National Geographic alliance, which includes all of the Americas, is set forth in an Alliance and License Agreement and a Tour Operator Agreement with terms until December 31, 2025.
 
Sven-Olof Lindblad, our founder and current Co-Chairperson of our board of directors, currently serves on the board of the Lindblad Expeditions–National Geographic Joint Fund for Exploration and Conservation and previously served on the National Geographic Society’s International Council of Advisors, which was composed of individuals identified by the National Geographic Society as visionary leaders from a range of professions and industries across the globe that exemplify the intellectual curiosity and quest for adventure that has driven the National Geographic Society’s mission since 1888. Mr. John M. Fahey, Jr., one of our board of directors, previously served as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the National Geographic Society.
 
Partnership with World Wildlife Fund
 
Natural Habitat has partnered with the WWF, since 2003, to promote sustainable conservation travel that directly promotes and protects nature. WWF is one of the world’s leading conservation groups with over six million members globally. Natural Habitat’s exclusive license agreement with WWF allows Natural Habitat to use the WWF name, logo and select mailing list through 2023 in return for a royalty fee. 
Business and Growth Strategies

The following are the key components of our business strategy:
 
Deliver Exceptional Guest Experiences
 
Our chief guiding principle throughout the organization is to ensure that everything adds value to the guest experience. This applies to every step of the process from the first engagement with a potential guest, through the booking process and travel preparations, the actual expedition, trip or adventure, whether onboard a vessel or off on explorations and tours, and once back at home.
 
We believe that our guests do not want to be passive tourists, so our expeditions and travel experiences foster active engagement. Our ships are equipped with tools for exploration to get our guests out in the open for up-close forays, or to let guests see deeper into the marine or terrestrial environments surrounding them. It is our goal to provide guests with differentiated opportunities with an experienced expedition team that adds to the guests’ understanding and appreciation, through dedicated observation, insightful commentary and engaging presentations, weaving the expedition into a cohesive narrative. On our ships this could include an opportunity for the guest to watch a killer whale circling a seal on an ice floe, while standing next to a marine biologist and an experienced nature photographer from National Geographic. On our land experiences this could include an immersive viewing of polar bears preparing to hunt on the ice under the guide of an expert naturalist.
 
This intense focus on seeking to elevate the overall experience and engaging with guests has resulted in highly favorable customer feedback. We believe that by consistently delivering exceptional experiences to our guests, we have built a highly valuable and trusted brand in the expedition cruising and land-based expedition market, which attracts a growing number of discerning and affluent guests who are prepared to pay a premium for our offerings.
 
We place a strong focus on innovation, which we seek to achieve by introducing new expedition options and continuously making improvements to our fleet and voyage experiences as new technology or operating procedures are developed. We make deployment decisions with the goal of optimizing the overall profitability of our portfolio, with these decisions generally made 18 to 36 months in advance. Adding new capacity and geographies allows us to expand our inventory of existing itineraries, extend into new markets and explore new destinations. 
 
High Visibility and Differentiated Revenue Management Strategy
 
Our business model generally allows us to generate consistent free cash flow with high revenue visibility. Given the nature of our expeditions and the expectation that our guests will seek to plan such trips with substantial lead time, we generally begin to market our expeditions approximately 12 to 24 months in advance of the departure date. Guests book their trips, on average, nine months prior to travel date for our Lindblad expeditions and seven months prior to travel for our land experiences, paying a deposit at booking, providing us significant visibility into future revenue and a source of cash flow. Final payment is due 60 to 120 days prior to the date of travel, dependent upon the selected expedition.
 
Unlike the large cruise line operators that serve the broader market, our product offerings are inclusive of most costs and therefore the advance customer payments provide us strong visibility into future revenues and the associated cash flows. By having such visibility into future business, we can more effectively manage any additional sales and marketing efforts that may be required
 
    7 

  

to ensure that the programs reach their targeted occupancy levels. We do not believe in driving participation through discounting and do not generally pursue such strategies. Instead, we focus on enhancements that add significant value to the product without significant incremental cost, as well as targeted marketing efforts in order to strengthen occupancy rates, if required. Based on our offerings, the targeted audience and premium pricing, our guests are generally older, more affluent and do not travel with three or four individuals in one cabin. As it is cruise industry convention to base 100% occupancy on two persons per cabin, the Lindblad segment may report occupancy levels that are somewhat lower than the large cruise lines serving the broader market, where three or more occupants per cabin is not uncommon. However, we have historically achieved strong occupancy rates including operating at 81%, 89% and 91% occupancies for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The occupancy rates for 2021 and 2020 have been skewed by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Maximize and Grow Net Yields per Available Guest Night 
 
We have historically achieved high net yields per available guest night and continue to see opportunities for growth. In the cruise industry, net yield per available guest night is a frequently referenced metric and refers to tour revenues net of commissions and certain direct costs in a specific period divided by the number of available guest nights. Our net yield per available guest night is driven by our offerings, premium pricing and ancillary guest revenue, such as pre- or post-voyage trip extensions, add-on optional activities, trip insurance and onboard spend. At the Lindblad segment, net yield per available guest night was $879, $1,048 and $1,051 in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The net yield per available guest night for 2021 and 2020 have been skewed by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our net yield per available guest night is significantly higher than the large-scale cruise line operators and we expect to be able to continue our track record of maintaining strong pricing and growing ancillary guest revenues through increased sales focus and marketing efforts.
Elevate Brand Awareness and Loyalty
 
The Lindblad brand is recognizable by our guests primarily due to our heritage, decades of sales and marketing investment and longstanding strategic alliance with National Geographic. We believe we have fostered strong guest and brand loyalty, as is evidenced by our high levels of repeat guests. Historically, approximately 40% of Lindblad guests booked through our U.S. office have been past guests. We have closely aligned our Lindblad marketing efforts with National Geographic to maximize impact in the marketplace and have engaged in a co-branding strategy with respect to our owned vessels. In addition, we are recognized as a leader in promoting the issue of conservation of the planet and encourage our guests to become engaged through the LEX-NG Fund. In the past, we have organized high-level meetings in the Arctic, Antarctic, the Galápagos Islands and Baja California to put a spotlight on key environmental issues in conjunction with organizations such as the Aspen Institute, TED and the WWF. These efforts help to build our brand and network of relationships and enhance our thought leadership. We will continue to focus on ensuring that each of our guests associates our brand with high-quality marine based adventure vacation experiences.
 
We maintain an active presence on numerous social media platforms, focusing primarily on those with the greatest reach to our target demographic. Developing our brand and growing our digital audience has been a point of emphasis and we have dramatically increased social followers, as well as engagement and impressions. Our increased efforts around digital marketing and social media have also resulted in significant earned media from brands, influencers and industry partners.
 
Disciplined Expansion
 
We believe affluent travelers view their retirement as “a time to travel and explore new places,” favoring immersive and authentic experiences. This has led to strong growth in the specialty cruise and adventure travel segments and we believe these trends will continue following the COVID-19 pandemic. We are focused on growing our business in a prudent and disciplined manner. When evaluating various strategies for expansion of guest capacity and product offerings, we consider closely the expected return on invested capital and the range of possibilities, such as a newbuild program, adding selected charters and the acquisitions of existing ships or operators.
 
Given the demand for expedition cruising, we have strategically expanded our owned and operated fleet from six ships to ten ships through a new build program. This included the delivery of two polar ice-class vessels, the National Geographic Resolution during 2021 and the National Geographic Endurance in 2020, more than doubling the size of our existing polar capacity, and the delivery of two new coastal vessels, the National Geographic Venture in 2018 and the National Geographic Quest in 2017, nearly tripling the capacity of our US-flagged fleet.
 
During 2021 we further diversified our product portfolio, with the acquisition of Off the Beaten Path, a land-based travel operator specializing in authentic national park experiences, DuVine, an international luxury cycling and adventure company focused on exceptional food and wine experiences, and Classic Journeys, a leading luxury walking tour company that offers highly curated active small-group and private custom journeys. Similar to the Company’s acquisition of Natural Habitat in 2016, these businesses are strong compliments to our existing product offerings, and we will leverage our experience and resources to accelerate their growth and capitalize on the growing demand for authentic and immersive adventure travel.  
 
    8 

  

We believe that we have the financial flexibility to pursue additional growth opportunities subject to, among other factors, our ability to identify attractive business opportunities and to negotiate favorable terms for such opportunities. Additionally, we believe that our platform is well positioned to opportunistically seek accretive purchases of operators that lack scale and capital, further extending our growth prospects. 
 
Operations
 
Guest Activities and Services
 
We provide our guests the opportunity and the tools to be active and engaged explorers. Our vessels carry a variety of equipment for exploration which, depending on the ship and destination, may include Zodiacs for water-based activities and quick transfers to shore, kayaks and paddleboards for personal exploration, motorized skiffs, an underwater camera, a remotely operated vehicle, a video microscope to study some of the smallest organisms of the marine ecosystem, a crow’s nest camera atop a ship’s mast, hydrophones for listening to vocalizations of marine mammals, snorkeling gear, scuba gear and wetsuits. An experienced and knowledgeable expedition staff leads guests in exploration while Zodiac riding, hiking onshore, paddling on the water or observing wildlife from ashore or onboard the ship. All voyages feature a certified photo instructor onboard and many include photographers from National Geographic.
 
All of our land tour companies share a commitment to an exceptional guest experience – achieved in part through small groups, best-in-class interpretation and guiding, and local connections built over decades of operating in their destinations. Each company offers a variety of services, activities and equipment specific to their tour segment. We provide equipment for guests such as kayaks, snowshoes, parkas, and bicycles – from high-end road bikes to luxurious e-bikes. We transport guests in vehicles specific to the journey such as customized polar rovers for up-close viewing of polar bears on the Tundra, specialized 4x4 Land Rovers while on safari or dedicated support vehicles that follow the day’s bicycle route distributing refreshments and offering a lift to tired bikers. Experienced, local guides lead guests on journeys while viewing grizzly bears in Alaska, cycling through Tuscany, hiking in Zion, touring ancient ruins in the Amazon, rafting the Grand Canyon or taking in meals with locals in a Mediterranean village. 
 
Our ships and land tours allow us to offer guests authentic, up-close experiences in the planet's wild, remote places, but at the same time, enjoy a high level of comfort, convenience and safety. High-quality dining is an integral part of our expedition experiences with influences and flavors that reflect the regions being explored, along with traditional fare. Food is sourced locally whenever practicable from sustainable providers and seating is open with a relaxed atmosphere. Our ships offer a range of services and amenities which allow our guests to travel in comfort. Depending on the ship, these may include a fitness center, a spa offering a variety of treatments, a photo kiosk for photographers to edit and sort photos, 24-hour beverage service, internet connection, laundry facilities and a doctor on call.
 
We offer to handle virtually all travel aspects related to guest reservations and transportation, simplifying the planning and booking process for our guests. We also provide guests the opportunity to purchase pre- and post-expedition extensions or services that may include additional hotel nights, air travel, private transfers, excursions, land travel packages and travel protection insurance.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We place a strong emphasis on identifying the needs of our guests and creating expedition and travel opportunities that our guests value. We use communication strategies and marketing campaigns designed to strengthen brand awareness and to emphasize the distinctive qualities of each experience we offer. Marketing strategies include the use of direct marketing, mail and email; digital media, including search, social media and programmatic ad buying; traditional media; brand websites; and travel agencies and other strategic third-party distribution partners.
 
We source our business through a combination of direct selling, travel agency networks and, at the Lindblad segment, through our strategic alliance with National Geographic. We invest in maintaining strong relationships with our key travel agency network partners and seek to maintain commission rates and incentive structures that are competitive within the marketplace.
 
Historically, the majority of our guests have been from the United States. Expedition cruise guests sourced from the U.S. represented approximately 98% of our total global expedition cruise guests’ ticket revenue in 2021 and 91% in 2020 and 2019.
 
Our largest channel for expedition cruise guest bookings is direct contact, either by guests calling and speaking with our expedition specialists or requesting a reservation online at our website. The direct channel represented approximately 39% of expedition cruise guest ticket revenues for 2021 and 2020 and 40% for 2019. 
 
We also generate significant bookings from travel agents and wholesalers, representing approximately 26% of expedition cruise guest ticket revenue for the year ended 2021, 30% for the year ended 2020 and 29% for the year ended 2019. Agent outreach

efforts are focused primarily on consortiums, or travel agent networks, which target affluent travelers. The four consortiums with which we have preferred partner agreements are Virtuoso, Signature, American Express and Ensemble. Preferred status provides their agents with financial incentives to book their customers on our expeditions and provides us the opportunity for enhanced marketing to their agents and end-user customers. Our agent and affinity sales team meet with hundreds of highly-targeted agents annually, at consortium conferences and training seminars, and in-person at agency offices to provide hands-on training, support and product knowledge.
 
The National Geographic relationship also serves as a significant channel for bookings for our expedition cruise business. Our alliance with National Geographic includes a co-selling and co-marketing arrangement through which National Geographic promotes our expedition cruise offerings in its marketing campaigns across web-based, email, print and other marketing platforms and sells our expeditions through its internal travel division. The National Geographic channel represented approximately 28% of expedition cruise guest ticket revenues for 2021, and 24% for 2020 and 2019. As part of this relationship, our owned vessels carry the National Geographic name.
 
The remainder of our expedition cruise bookings, 7% of guest ticket revenues for 2021, 2020 and 2019, comes from affinity groups and charters. Affinity groups are predominantly college and university alumni associations, and other travel organizations targeting specific market niches.
 
We have a broad and diverse marketing mix across multiple media platforms and channels, allowing us to effectively communicate our product offerings to past guests and prospective guests. We continually optimize our media mix to reach our target demographic. The majority of our annual global marketing spend is focused on consumer-direct channels. Our detailed brochures and websites present our expedition and tour offerings comprehensively, providing guests with all the information needed to make an informed travel decision. We invest significantly in digital media as part of our guest acquisition efforts with particular focus in paid search, social media, content development and programmatic video and display advertising. We also execute direct mail campaigns with the primary purpose of generating qualified leads, upon which we will fulfill requests with the appropriate product brochure and/or digital media.
 
We operate several websites, www.expeditions.com for our Lindblad expedition cruise offerings, www.nathab.com for our Natural Habitat nature adventures, www.duvine.com for our DuVine cycling adventures, www.offthebeatenpath.com for our Off the Beaten Path guided travel adventures and www.classicjourneys.com for our handcrafted luxury walking tours. Each website is supported internally by a dynamic content management system, allowing frequent updates, a visually-impactful design, large photos and video display with simple, straightforward navigation. Consumers are directed to key areas on each website through weekly emails, direct mail, social media, PR, and advertising. We also routinely offer webinars to provide greater insights into our expeditions, hosted by members of our expedition teams with intimate knowledge of the geographies featured. In 2021, www.expeditions.com launched a fully redesigned website that fits any device or screen and features enriched design and content to better reflect the expedition experience. This new website will also provide a significant boost in discoverability, driving awareness and lead generation through improved organic search.
 
Our marketing team encompasses broad and diverse skill sets including product and channel marketing, digital marketing, database marketing, copywriting and creative, video production and research and analytics.
 
Trip Pricing
 
Our voyage prices typically include accommodations and all expedition activities and meals, other than items of a personal nature, such as airfare to and from an expedition, spa treatments and certain other specialized events or activities. Prices vary depending on many factors, including the vessel, the destinations on a particular voyage, number of guest berths available, expedition length, cabin category selected and time of year during which the expedition takes place. Payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation with the balance due prior to departure.
 
We focus on maintaining list pricing of our offerings and any discounting that we pursue is tactical, targeted and infrequent. In addition to our standard expedition packages, we may be able to offer a complete vessel for charter and may provide incentives for this type of arrangement. Group and multi-generational family travel may also be eligible for additional incentives based upon the voyage, duration and number of guests travelling. From time to time, we may incentivize guests to book with us with a variety of offers, including free or reduced-price air transportation, hotel nights or other value-added items. We offer rewards to our guests through our loyalty program, Friends for Life, to encourage repeat business.
 
Our land-based travel prices typically include accommodations, transportation while on tour, gear specific to the tour and most activities and meals, other than items of a personal nature, such as airfare to and from the tour and certain other specialized events or activities. Prices vary depending on many factors, including the destination, activities included, tour length and time of year during which the trip takes place. Payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation with the balance due prior to departure.

Seasonality
 
Lindblad tour revenues from the sale of guest tickets are mildly seasonal, historically larger in the first and third quarters. The seasonality of our operating results fluctuates due to our vessels being taken out of service for scheduled maintenance or drydocking, which is typically during nonpeak demand periods, in the second and fourth quarters. Our drydock schedules are subject to cost and timing differences from year to year due to the availability of shipyards for certain work, drydock locations based on ship itineraries, operating conditions experienced especially in the polar regions and the applicable regulations of vessel classification societies in the maritime industry, which require more extensive reviews periodically. Drydocking impacts operating results by reducing tour revenues and increasing cost of tours.
 
Natural Habitat, DuVine, Off the Beaten Path and Classic Journeys brands are seasonal businesses, with the majority of Natural Habitat’s tour revenue recorded in the third and fourth quarters from its summer season departures and polar bear tours, while the majority of Off the Beaten Path, DuVine and Classic Journeys’ revenues are recorded during the second and third quarters from their spring and summer departures.
 
Ship Repair and Maintenance
 
In addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements, each of our expedition ships is taken out of service for a scheduled deeper maintenance period to conduct repairs and improvements. We maintain our fleet in accordance with applicable regulations, international conventions and insurance requirements. This includes regularly scheduled maintenance, periodic inspections, drydocking, wetdocking and overhaul. In addition, renovations and replacements of various vessel elements are part of the ongoing process of maintaining the vessels to a high standard of reliability, safety and comfort.
 
For U.S. flagged ships, the statutory requirement is an annual docking and U.S. Coast Guard inspections, normally conducted in drydock. Internationally flagged ships have scheduled dockings approximately every 12 months, for a period of up to three to six weeks. Drydock interval and required inspections are statutory requirements controlled under chapters of the International Convention of the Safety of Life at Sea (“SOLAS”) and Classification Society rules. Under these requirements, passenger ships must be inspected in drydock twice in five years, with the maximum duration between each drydock inspection not to exceed three years, and an underwater hull inspection is required annually. To the extent practicable each ship’s crew and hotel staff remain with the ship during drydocking periods and assist in performing repair and maintenance work. Drydockings are typically planned during non-peak demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service.
 
Suppliers
 
Our largest capital expenditures are for ship acquisition and capital improvements. Our largest operating expenditures are for ship maintenance, payroll, fuel, food and beverage, travel agent services and advertising and marketing. Most of the supplies that we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices.
Insurance
 
We maintain comprehensive insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels to protect against most of the risk involved in the conduct of our business.
 
We maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of each of our ships that includes additional coverage for disbursements, earnings and increased value. We also maintain protection and indemnity insurance for each of our owned ships. In addition, we maintain war risk insurance on each ship, which covers damage due to acts of war, including invasion, insurrection, terrorism, rebellion, piracy and hijacking. This includes coverage for physical damage to the ship, which is not covered under the hull policies as a result of war exclusion clauses in such hull policies. Consistent with most marine war risk policies, under the terms of the war risk insurance coverage, underwriters can give notice that the policy will be canceled and reinstated at higher premium rates. We also maintain insurance coverage for shoreside property, shipboard inventory and marine and non-marine general liability risks, as well as business interruption insurance for our owned ships based on the evaluation of the financial exposure per vessel for profitability. In addition, we maintain workers’ compensation, directors’ and officers’ liability and other insurance coverage.
 
Industry and Market
 
We believe the specialty and small ship cruising segment of the cruise industry demonstrates the following positive fundamentals:
 
    11 

  

Strong Growth in Specialty and Small Ship Cruising Segment
 
The specialty and small ship cruising segment of the cruise industry is characterized by vessel size, unique itineraries, active adventures, gourmet culinary programs, highly personalized service and a more inclusive offering. These exclusive attributes, combined with a growing worldwide target population, provide specialty and small ship cruising operators with significant pricing leverage as compared to the other segments of the cruise industry.
 
Ship based travel was growing rapidly prior to the pandemic and is forecasted to recover strongly with an estimated 32 million annual passengers and $36 billion market revenues by 2026, per a 2021 Statista report. Despite this anticipated growth, we believe the specialty cruise industry still has low penetration levels compared to similar land-based vacations, which we believe highlights the continued growth potential for the specialty cruise market following the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, in the COVID-19 environment, smaller ships allows for a highly controlled environment that is beneficial to implementing stringent cleaning protocols, while also providing for the ability to more efficiently and effectively test our guests and crew prior to boarding. Additionally, expeditions take place in remote locations where human interactions with persons not on the expedition are limited, so there is less opportunity for external influence. Smaller ships also have the ability to be flexible with regards to existing itineraries and are continually investigating additional itinerary opportunities both internationally and domestically, providing a further competitive advantage during these times. 
 
Specialty Land-Based Activity Segment
 
Land-based adventure travel is characterized by an emphasis on experience and connection with the visiting surroundings, with typical itineraries containing a number of the following components: nature and the outdoors, physical activity, novel or unique experiences, culture, wellness, sustainability and low impact. Top activities include hiking; culinary, cultural and wellness focused activities; and e-bike cycling. According to the Adventure Travel Trade Association and Euromonitor, the global market for adventure tourism was $683 billion in 2019 and is projected to grow to $1.6 trillion by 2026. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for small-group, immersive travel was growing due to traveler preferences shifting towards authentic experiences.
 
Our land tour companies are led by leaders with 100 years of combined experience in adventure travel, cycling quests and walking tour journeys. Within the specialty of each land tour company, we have journeyed guests through expeditions from the tundra of Manitoba and remote camps in Greenland, to snorkeling, sailing or hiking in the Galápagos Islands, to cycling through the French Alps, to walking in the thyme-scented countryside of Provence.
 
As pioneers in the expedition adventure travel sector, we have established deep expertise and knowledge of operating expedition tours in remote, wild locations. We have earned awards and honors from various representatives of the travel industry, including recognition for the quality of our offerings and our support for conservation and sustainable tourism.
 
Attractive Target Market Demographics
 
Our offerings appeal to a wide range of travelers, both individuals and families, but affluent individuals in the U.S. aged 50 years or older represent our largest demographic category. We believe that our small ship expedition and small group land tour offerings, with itineraries that promote up-close encounters with wildlife, nature and culture, have significant appeal to this target market. These individuals are also generally near-retirement or retired and have the leisure time and disposable income available to pursue the type of activities that we provide. Based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2021 National Projections, the age group of 50 years and older numbered approximately 121 million individuals in 2021, or approximately 36% of the U.S. population, and is expected to grow 4% to 126 million by 2025.
High Barriers to Entry
 
The cruise industry in general, and the adventure travel and specialty cruise industries specifically, are characterized by high barriers to entry, which include the expertise and experience required to operate safely and effectively in remote locations, the existence of several well-established and recognizable brands and the time and personal relationships required to develop strong networks of experts, guides and vendors to lead and support experiential travel. Additionally, there are large investments required to build new, sophisticated ships, long lead times necessary to construct new ships and limited newbuild shipyard capacity. Operators must also develop strong travel agent network partnerships, as well as acquire local permits or licenses required to operate in a diverse range of geographies.
Competition

For our ship-based expeditions, we compete with a number of cruise lines with competition varying by destination. The market is currently fragmented and primarily comprised of private operators. The primary competitors that operate in the geographic regions we serve include Silversea Expeditions, Quark Expeditions, Compagnie du Ponant, Hurtigruten and UnCruise Adventures. We expect our competition in the specialty cruise business to continue to increase in future years as the expedition
 
    12 

  

cruising market continues to grow and large cruise operators seek access to the market through acquisitions or development of their own vessels and operations.
 
For our land-based expeditions, we compete with a variety of companies offering itineraries in the countries in which we operate. These range from small private operators to larger companies operating across multiple countries. Some of our larger competitors include Abercrombie & Kent, Overseas Adventure Travel, Mountain Travel Sobek, Butterfields & Robinson and Backroads.
 
We also compete with other vacation alternatives such as land-based resort hotels and sightseeing destinations for guests’ leisure time. 
 
Environmental and Social
 
We are driven by the goal of helping people see, feel, discover and appreciate the natural world, increasing awareness and appreciation for the environment and, in turn, care for sustainability. We have been a leader in sustainable, responsible travel for more than 50 years, through raising awareness, adopting green business practices, protecting nature, preserving culture, supporting local communities and artisans and practicing sustainability throughout every level of its operations, from ships to offices. In addition, we are committed to company-wide diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, including recruitment, hiring and mandatory training for all employees.
 
Lindblad and Natural Habitat are 100% carbon neutral, with Natural Habitat being the world’s first 100% carbon neutral travel company, and both are single-use plastic free. In 2008, the LEX-NG Fund was established to support ocean conservation, the restoration of marine and coastal habitats and environmental stewardship.
 
Environmental Stewardship
 
Our staff is involved in organizations such as the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators and the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators, which seek to lead the tourism industry with management best practices for visiting places such as Antarctica, the Arctic and the Galápagos Islands. We also work with the Charles Darwin Research Station and Charles Darwin Foundation on conservation initiatives geared toward preserving the Galápagos Islands.
 
In 2018, we eliminated guest-facing single-use plastics fleet-wide and we have been a carbon neutral company since 2019. To offset the carbon footprint of our business (including fleet operations; expedition operations; staff and crew travel; waste; and other small but measurable sources of emissions), we work with South Pole, Inc., the world's leading developer of international emission reduction projects. We fund projects to utilize technologies including solar, wind, geothermal and hydropower to mitigate, sequester or remove carbon from the atmosphere, which are certified under one of the industry-recognized standards; (i) Verified Carbon Standard, (ii) Gold Standard VER or (iii) Certified Emission Reduction. Our 2021 projects included a geothermal project in Indonesia, wind power projects New Caledonia and Columbia, a solar project in India, and a Hydropower project in Vietnam. All projects in our portfolio support the UN's established Sustainable Development Goals.
 
Our staff works with several organizations to promote sustainable seafood programs where possible, including (i) the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch program, whose scientific-based standards guide seafood producers, industry leaders, organizations, and governments around the globe to improve their fishing practices, (ii) a co-op in the Galápagos Islands committed to ocean conservation and sustainable, transparent practices minimizing negative impact on the ocean density, ocean floor and the by-catch of non-targeted species, and (iii) a company in Baja California, Mexico that works to foster a market for environmentally sustainable and socially responsible seafood by working with local fisher cooperatives, promoting good fishing management and sustainability of Mexico’s marine ecosystem.
 
At Natural Habitat, we have crafted our entire enterprise around the mission of conservation through exploration – protecting our planet by inspiring travelers, supporting local communities and bolding influencing the entire travel industry. Sustaining the world’s wild places and the people who live in and around them is integral to who we are.
 
Because of our commitment to environmentally friendly travel, we began a relationship with World Wildlife Fund in 2003 as their conservation travel provider. We have provided more than $4.5 million in support of WWF’s mission to conserve nature and reduce the most pressing threats to the diversity of life on Earth. And our travelers have donated an additional $13.5 million in support of WWF priorities in some of the most precious yet imperiled places on the planet. This innovative partnership benefits our travelers, our company, and the planet as we work together to change the way people think about travel.
 
Since 2007, Natural Habitat Adventures has been the world's first 100% carbon-neutral travel company. In 2019, we took our commitment to a whole new level: we also offset all our travelers' flights to and from our global adventure destinations, increasing the total amount of our carbon offsetting by 300-400%.
 
    13 

  

Natural Habitat has been actively working to mitigate the waste produced on our adventures. In 2011, we opted to get rid of single-use plastic water bottles on our trips, accomplishing that goal worldwide within two years. In 2018, we eliminated plastic straws. In 2019, Natural Habitat operated the World’s First Zero Waste Adventure in Yellowstone National Park, an ambitious quest to reduce waste so dramatically that everything we generated on a weeklong trip would fit into one quart-sized bottle.
 
Lindblad Expeditions–National Geographic Joint Fund for Exploration and Conservation (LEX-NG Fund)
 
One of Lindblad’s guiding principles is to positively impact the areas we explore and in which we work. To this end, we, along with the National Geographic Society, created the LEX-NG Fund to support projects at the global, regional and local level. The objective of the LEX-NG Fund is to support projects to understand and protect our world’s oceans, restore critical marine and coastal habitats, and foster environmental stewardship in the regions visited by our fleet, and beyond. Together with our guests, we have granted $16.3 million to a variety of projects supporting the regions we visit since the Fund was established in 2008. Since we and the National Geographic Society together cover the LEX-NG Fund’s operating costs, 100% of guest contributions go directly to on-the-ground projects. During 2021, the LEX-NG Fund issued 18 unique grants to early career conservationists, educators, researchers, and storytellers, plus six unique grants to regional partners in the Galápagos Islands. It also pledged support to The National Geographic Society’s Pristine Seas program, Grosvenor Teacher Fellowship, and three additional regional partners in Southeast Alaska, Baja California, the Galápagos Islands, and the Peruvian Amazon. These 2021 grants and pledges are supported by approximately $1.9 million in funding from the LEX-NG Fund. In 2020, the LEX-NG Fund issued eight unique grants to eight regional partners in five key regions, while also supporting three major National Geographic Society conservation, education and research initiatives: Pristine Seas, Grosvenor Teacher Fellowship and Early Career Grants. All funds being spent for these activities were donated by guests traveling aboard our fleet and proceeds from the common stock shares referenced above. The LEX-NG Fund is managed jointly by one of our staff members and one National Geographic Society staff member, and the Board is currently comprised of five members, including Sven-Olof Lindblad, our founder and board of directors Co-Chairperson; Ian Miller, Chief Science and Innovation Officer at the National Geographic Society; and Alex Moen, Chief Explorer Engagement Officer at the National Geographic Society.
Human Capital Resources and Management

At Lindblad Expeditions, we adhere to our guiding principles, one of which is treating everyone with dignity and respect, and we simply could not do our work without the diverse kaleidoscope of humanity that creates and delivers our remarkable offerings across the planet. As a Company that respects and celebrates the inherent diversity in the places we explore, we recognize the need to mirror that same diversity and all the interconnected perspectives within our organization. We are committed to building a community of different genders, races, ages, sexual orientations, chosen identities, and countries of origin where every person brings their whole self to work and whose skills, talents and abilities are valued. We believe we can explore farther and in a more meaningful way by actively creating a more diverse and inclusive organization where everyone feels that they belong.
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 720 employees, including approximately 390 shipboard employees, and approximately 310 full-time and 20 part-time employees in our shoreside operations. Some of our employees in Ecuador are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced us to suspend travel operations and furlough the majority of vessel crew as well as a portion of our shoreside and office personnel, during which time health and other benefits were provided. As travel operations resumed during 2021 all furloughed employees were reinstated.
 
The safety, health and wellness of our employees is a top priority. The Company promotes the health and wellness of its employees by strongly encouraging work-life balance and keeping the employee portion of health care premiums to a minimum. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a unique challenge with regard to maintaining employee safety while continuing successful operations. Through teamwork and the adaptability of our management and staff, our office employees have continued to primarily work remotely as we resume general business operations.
 
We encourage and support the growth and development of our employees and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the organization. We look for enthusiastic team members who are accomplished in their field, excellent communicators, good leaders, and have a passion for travel. One of our guiding principles is to ensure that everything adds value to the guest experience and our office personnel, expedition staff and marine teams work diligently to ensure that our guests receive exceptional experiences and service. It is our daily interactions with guests that help them appreciate the history and natural history of each location, find inspiration, adventure and have a once in a lifetime experience. This guiding principle also furthers employee retention by honoring the value of employee service and actively prioritizing concern for our employees’ well-being, supporting our employees’ career goals, offering competitive wages and providing valuable fringe benefits that aid in retention of our top-performing employees. We align base and variable pay with the external market, to ensure external competitiveness while maintaining internal value or equity within the organization. Our short-term and long-term incentive plans are designed to provide a variable pay opportunity to reward the attainment of key financial and operational goals and shareholder value creation. The mix among base compensation, short-term incentives and long-term incentives is designed to align with the competitive market. We provide a variety of benefits including but not limited to healthcare coverage, 401(k) retirement savings and travel opportunities on our expeditions for free or at reduced cost. 
 
    14 

  

Fluctuations may occur within our workforce due to seasonality, expedition itineraries and the number of vessels in operation. We try to manage our attrition, approving the replacement of key positions that we believe are critical to sustaining improved business performance and guest satisfaction. We also analyze departure data so we can continually improve upon the employee experience. Our talent management and succession plan process includes the identification of key positions based on current and future business strategies and the identification of potential successors.
 
Regulation
 
Our ships are regulated by various international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Our owned ships are registered in the U.S., the Bahamas or Ecuador, as applicable. These countries are signatories to the International Maritime Organization safety, security and environmental instruments and policy. Each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry, including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of the ships, guests and crew as well as environmental protection. Each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations. Ships operating out of U.S. ports are subject to inspection by the U.S. Coast Guard for compliance with international treaties and U.S. maritime regulations and by the United States Public Health Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for sanitary and health conditions. Ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries visited. Health, safety, security, environmental and financial responsibility issues are, and will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the U.S. and internationally.
 
From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes may be adopted that could impact operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future including potential new guidelines and requirements addressing COVID-19 precautions.
 
Safety and Security Regulations
 
Our ships are required to comply with international safety standards established by SOLAS, which, among other things, establishes requirements for ship design, structural features, materials, construction, life-saving equipment and safe management, and operation of ships to ensure guest and crew safety. The SOLAS standards are revised from time to time and our vessels are compliant with applicable SOLAS requirements. SOLAS incorporates the International Safety Management Code (“ISM Code”), which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention. The ISM Code is mandatory for all vessels, including passenger vessel operators. All of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities and maintain the required certificates of compliance with the ISM Code.
 
Our ships are also subject to various security requirements, including the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (“ISPS Code”), which is part of SOLAS, and the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”), which applies to ships that operate in U.S. ports. In order to satisfy these security requirements, we implement security measures, conduct vessel security assessments and develop security plans. The security plans for all of the ships have been submitted to, and approved by, the respective countries of registry for compliance with the ISPS Code and the MTSA.
 
Environmental Regulations
 
We are subject to various U.S. and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under such laws and regulations, we are prohibited from, among other things, discharging certain materials, such as petrochemicals and plastics, into the waterways. From time to time, environmental and other regulators may consider more stringent regulations, which may affect our operations and increase compliance costs.
 
The ships are subject to the International Maritime Organization’s regulations under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (the “MARPOL Regulations”), which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil, sewage, garbage and air emissions. We have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil, sewage and air pollution prevention for all of our ships.
 
The MARPOL Regulations impose global limitations on the sulfur content of fuel used by ships operating worldwide and also establish special Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”) with stringent limitations on sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions in these areas. As of February 2014, there were four established ECAs: the Baltic Sea, the North Sea/English Channel, certain of the waters surrounding the North American coast, and the waters surrounding Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Currently, ships operating in ECAs are required to operate on fuel with a sulfur content of not more than 0.1% m/m (mass by mass). Ships operating elsewhere were previously subject to a limit of 3.5%, which was reduced to not more than 0.5% m/m on and after January 1, 2020.
 
In July 2011, MARPOL Regulations introduced mandatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include the utilization of an energy efficiency design index (“EEDI”) for new ships as well as the establishment of an energy efficient
 
    15 

  

management plan for all ships. The EEDI is a performance-based mechanism that requires a certain minimum energy efficiency in new ships. These regulations apply to new vessels commissioned after January 1, 2013.
 
The Coastwise Laws

Our U.S. flag vessels, the National Geographic Sea Bird, the National Geographic Sea Lion, the National Geographic Quest and the National Geographic Venture, are subject to the U.S. laws relating to the transport of passengers between U.S. ports in the U.S. coastwise trade.
 
These laws relating to vessels are principally contained in 46 U.S.C. §55103 and the federal regulations promulgated thereunder and are commonly referred to collectively as the “Coastwise Laws.” Subject to limited exceptions, vessels transporting passengers between ports of places in the United States, whether directly or by the way of foreign port, must be “coastwise qualified”. To be qualified, a vessel must be owned and operated by “citizens of the United States” within the meaning of the governing laws and regulations. In the case of a corporation: (i) the corporation must be organized under the laws of the U.S. or of a state, territory or possession thereof; (ii) each of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board of directors of such corporation, and each person authorized to act in the absence or disability of such persons, must be a U.S. citizen; (iii) no more than a minority of the number of directors of such corporation necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business can be non-U.S. citizens; and (iv) at least 75% of each class or series of stock in such corporation must be beneficially owned by U.S. citizens.
Labor Regulations
 
The International Labour Organization, an agency of the United Nations that develops worldwide employment standards, adopted a Consolidated Maritime Labour Convention (the “Convention”) in 2006, which became effective in August 2013. The Convention reflects a broad range of standards and conditions governing all aspects of crew management for ships in international commerce, including additional requirements not previously in effect relating to the health, safety, repatriation, entitlements and status of crewmembers and crew recruitment practices. Each of our ships, except for our two ships operating in Ecuador (not a signatory to the Convention), has received its certification of compliance with the requirements of the Convention.
Consumer Financial Responsibility Regulations
 
U.S. law requires the operators of passenger vessels embarking passengers at U.S. ports to be certified by the United States Federal Maritime Commission as to their ability to satisfy obligations with respect to unearned passenger revenue in case of non-performance, and for liability in case of casualty or personal injury. We satisfy these requirements with respect to our U.S. embarking expeditions of the National Geographic Sea Bird, National Geographic Sea Lion, National Geographic Quest, National Geographic Venture, National Geographic Orion and the National Geographic Endurance through an escrow account for passenger deposits and through our liability insurers.
 
Regulations Regarding Protection of Disabled Persons
 
Our U.S. flag vessels, the National Geographic Sea Bird, National Geographic Sea Lion, National Geographic Quest and the National Geographic Venture are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which creates affirmative requirements intended to facilitate access by disabled persons. The ADA requires that our U.S. flagged vessels make “reasonable accommodation” in their policies, practices and procedures to facilitate the carriage of passengers with disabilities.
 
In June 2013, the U.S. Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board proposed guidelines for the construction and alteration of passenger vessels to ensure that the vessels are readily accessible to and usable by passengers with disabilities. If and when finalized, these guidelines will be used by the U.S. Department of Transportation and U.S. Department of Justice to implement mandatory and enforceable standards for passenger vessels covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act. We cannot, at this time, accurately predict whether we will be required to make material modifications or incur significant additional expenses given the status of the proposed guidelines.
 
Local Regulations
 
Our ability to follow our planned itinerary for any expedition cruise may be affected by a number of factors, including local government regulations and restrictions and other restrictions on access, including access to protected or preserved areas, including national parks. 
Corporate Information and History
 
We were originally incorporated in Delaware on August 9, 2010 with the name Capitol Acquisition Corp. II as a blank check company to acquire, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, plan of arrangement,
