Item 1.       Business
Overview
We are a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company specializing in the end-to-end development and commercialization of therapies that arm the immune system against a wide range of diseases including cancer and infectious disease. Our newly focused discovery efforts enhance our ability to support in-house development and nomination of biologics for our preclinical and clinical development efforts. Furthermore, our Scorpion Biological Services, Inc. (“Scorpion”) subsidiary enables us to enhance efficiency and decrease our dependence on third-party contract research and development biomanufacturing organizations (CDMO) as we advance into early and late-stage clinical trials and progress our research, development, and commercial pipeline. Finally, our anticipated acquisition of Elusys Therapeutics, Inc. supports our ability to develop critical therapeutic innovations such as RapidVax® for the biodefense sector. These efforts reinforce our goal of decreasing the time and increasing the efficiency of drug development to accelerate the delivery and commercialization of novel immune activating therapies. 
​
Our gp96 platform and RapidVax® platforms are designed to leverage the ability of gp96 to constitutively transport predefined antigens of interest to antigen presenting cells (APCs) that in turn stimulate an antigen-specific immune response that includes B cells, CD4+ T-cells, and cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells. HS-110 (viagenpumatucel-L), an allogeneic (“off-the-shelf”) therapy, is our lead gp96 asset having completed Phase 2 enrollment of a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) clinical trial. HS-130, another gp96 platform asset, is engineered to express the extracellular domain of OX40 ligand as a fusion protein (OX40L-Ig) to enhance T-cell expansion and memory cell formation. The safety of HS-130 is being evaluated in a Phase 1 solid tumor trial with findings to support the development of our RapidVax platform. 
​
RapidVax is designed as a programmable vaccine expressing gp96-Ig and OX40L-Ig that can be manufactured in bulk, stockpiled, and rapidly customized upon identification of a biological threat to enable an accelerated time to clinic and to harness shared development, clinical safety, and manufacturing synergies. We have also formed a Biothreat Advisory Board to aid in advancing these biodefense initiatives.
​
Our Death Receptor 3/TNF receptor superfamily member 25 (DR3/TNFRSF25) platform is focused on the development of agents targeting this cellular receptor. In the absence of a danger or activating signal, co-stimulation of DR3 on T-cells results in the selective expansion of immunosuppressive Tregs that can reduce inflammation. Conversely, co-stimulation of DR3 on T-cells in the presence of a danger or activating signal (arising from injury, infection, or cancer) promotes the expansion of inflammatory effector T-cells that play a critical role in mediating anti-tumor and anti-pathogen responses. We believe therapeutic targeting of this pathway has the potential to shift the balance between immunosuppression and

inflammation and therefore restore stability to the immune system. PTX-35, a monoclonal antibody, is under evaluation in an open-label, dose escalation, Phase 1 clinical trial assessing safety and tolerability in patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to, or otherwise ineligible for standard of care. 
​
Recent Developments
On December 20, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with our wholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), Elusys Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Elusys”) and Fortis Advisors LLC, pursuant to which, subject to certain conditions, we will acquire Elusys through the merger (the “Merger”) of Merger Sub with Elusys. Following the closing of the Merger, Elusys will become a wholly owned subsidiary. Elusys is a company focused on the commercialization of ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab), which is a monoclonal antibody antitoxin for the “Category A” biological warfare and bioterrorism threat anthrax designed to combat a potential anthrax attack. Elusys has key expertise in the development of biodefense agents having received over $250M of non-dilutive advanced- development contracts from National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Defense (DoD), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to support the development of Anthim. To prepare for the possibility of the use of Bacillus anthracis as a biological weapon, the U.S. government acquires and maintains equipment and medical countermeasures for anthrax treatment and prevention as part of CDC’s Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). The SNS is a national repository of large quantities of medicines, vaccines, and other medical supplies stored in strategic locations around the nation.  Anthim has also been delivered to the US Strategic National Stockpile (“SNS”) as the result of a successful, multi-year partnership with the U.S. government. Following clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in March 2016 and orphan drug exclusivity for the treatment of inhalational anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis inhalation in combination with antibiotics, and as a prophylaxis when alternative therapies are not available or are not appropriate. In July 2020, Health Canada approved ANTHIM’s New Drug Submission (NDS) for the treatment of inhalation anthrax. ANTHIM has also received marketing approval in the E.U. and the U.K., under the trade name of Obiltoxaximab SFL. The acquisition of Elusys has not been completed and is subject to several conditions. 
Anthrax is a disease caused by Bacillus anthracis. While it is primarily a disease of animals, cases of anthrax in humans occur through contact with infected animals or animal products or through intentional spread of Bacillus anthracis spores as a biowarfare or bioterrorism agent. Anthrax is regarded as a top (“Category A”) biological warfare and bioterrorism threat for as untreated inhalational anthrax has a high fatality rate, Bacillus anthracis is widely available and have been used in the past as a biological weapon, and multi-drug resistant (MDR) Bacillus anthracis is recognized by Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise as a high-priority threat. Anthim inhibits the binding of PA to its cellular receptors, preventing the intracellular entry of the anthrax lethal factor and edema factor, the enzymatic toxin components responsible for the pathogenic effects of anthrax toxin. 
Material Terms of the Merger
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as merger consideration (“Merger Consideration”) we (i) agreed to pay the current equity holders of Elusys (the “Sellers”) $3,000,000 at Closing; and (ii) agreed to pay the Sellers $2,000,000, subject to reduction based on the cash balance of Elusys at Closing and other purchase price reductions specified in the Merger Agreement, at the same time as the initial pass through revenue is distributed to the Sellers as described below and (iii) earn out payments for a period of 12 years from the date of Closing equal to 10% of the gross dollar amount of payments received during each one year period during such twelve year period with respect to any sale, license or commercialization anywhere in the world of Anthim that either: (a) occurs during the first nine years after the Closing Date in any respect; or (b) occurs thereafter pursuant to any contract, agreement, commitment or order that is placed, granted, awarded or entered into during the first nine years after the Closing Date.
In addition, Elusys is expected to receive additional revenue from the future fulfillment of an existing U.S. Government contract and we have agreed to fulfill the future obligations of Elusys under such contract and pass through and distribute to the Sellers the revenue that is received under such contract minus the costs associated with such fulfillment obligations, subject to certain adjustments to the Merger Consideration specified in the Merger Agreement, including income taxes payable with respect to such payments. The Merger Agreement further provides that eighty percent of any amounts paid 

4



to and received by Elusys after the Closing and prior to June 30, 2023 with respect to the sale of 1,500 pre-filled vials of Anthim shall be paid to the Sellers, subject to certain adjustments specified in the Merger Agreement.
At Closing, we also agreed to contribute to the payment of 50% of certain Elusys lease termination and employee severance payments. We also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, finance, operate and promote Anthim and maintain the existing government contract and to continue to operate the Elusys business so as to allow the Sellers to receive the Merger Consideration.
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of Heat, Elusys and the Merger Sub. The consummation of the Merger was subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including Elusys obtaining a requisite stockholder vote to approve the Merger, which approval was obtained. Subject to certain customary limitations, the Sellers have agreed to indemnify us and our officers and directors against certain losses related to, among other things, breaches of Elusys’ representations and warranties, certain specified liabilities and the failure to perform covenants or obligations under the Merger Agreement.
A special committee of Heat’s Board of Directors negotiated and approved the transaction and Cassel Salpeter & Co. provided a fairness opinion in connection with the transaction. Cassel Salpeter served as financial advisor to the special committee of Board of Directors.
Elusys was formed in 1998 by Jeff Wolf, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, who directly and through affiliated entities owns approximately 1.2% of the outstanding stock of Elusys, in the form of common stock, which is subordinate in terms of distributions to the Elusys preferred stock. Due to the potential conflict of interest, we formed a Special Committee of its Board of Directors to review and negotiate the Merger Agreement. However, pursuant to the terms governing the Elusys preferred stock, the preferred stockholders of Elusys will receive all of the initial $5 million of Merger Consideration and all of the net payments from the $31 million of revenues related to fulfillment of the existing SNS contract. While the amount of earn out payments, if any, to be made over the 12 year period following closing is very uncertain, it also presently seems likely that most if not all of such payments will also be paid to the preferred stockholders of Elusys under the terms of such preferred stock. 
The foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement that is filed herewith as Exhibit 2.1.

Technology Platforms
gp96 Platform 
Our proprietary gp96 platform leverages the adjuvant (immune stimulatory) properties of the heat shock protein gp96 to induce the immune system’s own response against cancer and infectious disease. gp96 naturally chaperones activation peptides (antigens) to antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, under stress conditions such as infection and cell death. Extracellular gp96 can stimulate innate immune toll-like receptors 2 and 4 on APCs to promote activation and subsequent processing and presentation of chaperoned antigens to T-cells. Our platform is designed to exploit the chaperoning activity of gp96 to constitutively transport predefined antigens of interest to APCs that in turn stimulate an antigen-specific immune response that includes B cells, CD4+ T-cells, and cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells.
​
In the context of cancer, this platform is designed to activate and expand tumor antigen specific “killer” T-cells to destroy a patient’s cancer. By turning immunologically “COLD tumors HOT,” we believe our platform can become an essential component of the immuno-oncology regimen to enhance the effectiveness and durability of checkpoint inhibitors and other cancer therapies, thereby improving outcomes for those patients less likely to benefit from checkpoint inhibitors alone. We believe this is a highly differentiated approach as our platform can deliver a broad range of tumor antigens that are previously unrecognized by the patient’s immune system and that have the potential to generate a multivalent response to address tumor heterogeneity. 
Our leading cancer vaccine therapeutics are replication incompetent, “off-the-shelf”, allogenic cell-based therapies that are locally delivered into the skin and can be administered with a variety of immuno-modulators to enhance a patient’s immune response. Unlike many other “patient specific” or autologous immunotherapy approaches, this fully allogeneic, “off-the-shelf” approach provides a means to quickly administer the biotherapeutic without the need to extract and expand blood or tumor tissue from individual patients or create individualized treatment based on the patient’s haplotype. Our gp96 product candidates are produced from allogeneic cell lines expressing a broad repertoire of established tumor-specific antigens. Because each patient receives the same treatment, we believe that our immunotherapy approach offers superior speed to initiation, logistics, manufacturing efficiencies, and importantly, cost benefits, compared to “personalized” precision medicine approaches.
Besides its utility in oncology, our gp96 platform has been shown to activate the human immune system to combat infectious diseases. Our collaborators have laid a solid foundation by engineering different pathogenic antigens into the platform. Previous preclinical studies using our gp96 platform includes SIV/HIV, Malaria, Zika and COVID-19.
About ComPACT®
ComPACT is designed to further enhance our gp96 platform by facilitating antigen-driven T-cell activation and specific co-stimulation in a single product. By delivering the gp96 heat shock protein and a T-cell co-stimulatory fusion protein (OX40L) as a single therapeutic, this approach has the potential to simplify combination immunotherapy development. This dual design has several potential advantages including: (a) enhanced activation of antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells; (b) boosting the number of antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells compared to OX40L alone; (c) stimulation of durable T-cell memory; (d) the differentiation of T follicular helper cells that facilitate antibody production by B cells; (e) demonstration of less toxicity, as the source of associated antigens and co-stimulator are supplied at the same time locally in the draining lymph nodes, which drives targeted, specific immunity rather than throughout the body; and (f) simplification of combination immunotherapy versus systemic co-stimulation with conventional monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).
​
RapidVax® Platform
Unveiled at the 2021 World Vaccine & Immunotherapy Antiviral Congress, RapidVax® is a flexible “plug-and-play” vaccine platform designed to enable an accelerated response to a wide variety of biological threats and is built on the foundation of our learnings from our various gp96 programs (noted above). RapidVax leverages our vast experience developing gp96-based vaccines and couples the immune-activating properties of heat shock protein gp96 and the T-cell co-stimulator OX40L with a flexible antigen expression system to promote antigen-specific T-cell activation, the 

6



generation of long-lasting memory cells, and neutralizing antibody production via the interaction of T follicular helper cells with B cells. 
​
RapidVax is designed to utilize a common unprogrammed vaccine base that can be manufactured in bulk, stockpiled, and rapidly customized upon identification of a biological threat to enable an accelerated time to clinic and to harness shared development, clinical safety, and manufacturing synergies. 
​
This platform has several potential advantages including but not limited to: (a) potential stockpiling capability designed to accelerate time to clinic by harnessing prior optimizations in development, safety, and manufacturing; (b) potential customization with multiple full length target antigens to increase potential protection against pathogen variants; (c) enhanced activation of antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells; (d) boosting the number of antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells compared to OX40L alone; (e) stimulation of durable T-cell memory; and (f) the differentiation of T follicular helper cells that facilitate antibody production by B cells.
​
DR3/TNFRSF25 Platform
Our Death Receptor 3/TNF receptor superfamily member 25 (DR3/TNFRSF25) platform is focused on the development of agents targeting this cellular receptor. DR3 recognizes the cytokine TNF-like ligand 1A (TL1A) secreted by several immune cell types including dendritic cells, monocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells. In the absence of a danger or activating signal, co-stimulation of DR3 on T-cells results in the selective expansion of immunosuppressive Tregs that can reduce inflammation. Conversely, co-stimulation of DR3 on T-cells in the presence of a danger or activating signal (arising from injury, infection, or cancer) promotes the expansion of inflammatory effector T-cells that play a critical role in mediating anti-tumor and anti-pathogen responses. We believe therapeutic targeting of this pathway has the potential to shift the balance between immunosuppression and inflammation and therefore restore stability and balance to the immune system. 
​
Agonists of the DR3 pathway have demonstrated benefit in several non-oncology disease models including rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, allergic lung inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease, infectious disease, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Conversely, DR3 agonism in the presence of tumor antigens and combined with our HS-110 and HS-130 immunotherapies or an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor leads to a reduction in the suppressive activity of Tregs, compromised Treg stability, increased Treg plasticity, and an increased percentage of inflammatory CD4+ Th1, CD4+ Th17, CD8+ effector T-cells that delay disease progression in solid tumor models. 
​
We believe these dynamic immunomodulatory properties of the DR3 pathway make it a compelling therapeutic target with various potential medical applications for either inducing inflammatory responses or restoring stability to the immune system. To date, we are the only known company with a disclosed program targeting DR3 for use in immuno-oncology, with a broad, pioneering intellectual property estate.

HS-110 (viagenpumatucel-L): Clinical Stage
Based on our gp96 platform technology, we have developed the product candidate HS-110 (viagenpumatucel-L) as a potential treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). HS-110 is an allogenic “off-the-shelf” cellular vaccine derived from a lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell line and genetically modified to secrete a wide range of cancer-associated antigens bound to the immunostimulatory chaperone gp96. This approach is designed to stimulate and facilitate uptake of these antigens by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), which in turn activate a broad, T-cell medicated immune response against a patient’s cancer. For additional technology details, please review the gp96 platform section above. 
We have completed the enrollment of our Phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of HS-110 in combination with either nivolumab (Opdivo®), a Bristol-Myers Squibb anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, or Merck’s anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®), for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. Eligible patient 

7



populations included individuals in a second line or greater setting, or with pembrolizumab in a front-line maintenance setting. 
On February 9, 2021, we announced positive interim data from the Phase 2 trial. A substantial survival benefit was observed in a cohort of previously treated, checkpoint inhibitor naïve patients with advanced NSCLC (Cohort A, N = 47). A median overall survival (mOS) of 24.6 months was observed with a median follow-up time of 19.4 months and a one-year survival rate of 61.7% (Cohort A). For historical reference, the BMS CheckMate 057 study evaluating a similar population of previously treated, advanced NSCLC patients who received nivolumab as a single agent reported a mOS of 12.2 months and a one-year survival rate of 50.7%.
For NSCLC patients undergoing disease progression following checkpoint inhibitor therapy, there are a limited number of therapeutic options, with chemotherapy reporting a mOS of 6.8 to 9.0 months based on the literature. As of February 9, 2021, in our Phase 2 study, we observed that HS-110 and nivolumab combinatorial treatment of NSCLC patients exhibiting disease progression following previous PD-(L)1 therapy resulted in a mOS of 11.9 months with a median follow-up time of 11.9 months (Cohort B, N = 68).
As of this February 9, 2021 data cut, 30% of the patients in Cohort A and 26% of the patients in Cohort B were still alive. HS-110 has a favorable safety profile with no treatment-related serious adverse reactions. In addition, review of immune-related adverse events reported in the study raised no safety concerns. The data to date demonstrate that combination of HS-110 and nivolumab treatment is well-tolerated.
Further subset analysis was reported on May 20, 2021 when we announced that an abstract entitled “Interim results of viagenpumatucel-L (HS-110) plus nivolumab in previously treated patients (pts) with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in two treatment settings” had been accepted for poster presentation at the 2021 ASCO Annual Meeting. Announced on June 4, 2021 these findings were presented by Roger B. Cohen, MD, Professor of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine at the meeting. Analysis of a subset of Cohort A patients that experienced an injection site reaction (ISR+) revealed increased progression free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (mOS) (hazard ratio [HR]=0.43, p=0.01; HR=0.23, p<0.001). A longer mOS was also observed in patients with PD-L1 expression level ≥ 1% (HR=0.25, p=0.02). Similarly, an increased mOS was also reported in ISR+ patients in Cohort B (HR=0.48, p=0.03).
​
Due to the large number of patients expected to be enrolled in any pivotal clinical trial of HS-110, we do not anticipate initiating a pivotal trial of HS-110 until after we have secured additional potential financing via a strategic partnership.
​
HS-130: Clinical Stage
We have completed enrollment of our first-in-human Phase 1 open label dose-escalation study evaluating the safety of HS-130 in combination with HS-110 for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. HS-130 is designed to test our ComPACT™ technology approach by secreting the T-cell co-stimulatory fusion protein OX40L to support the expansion of T-cells and the generation of immunological memory. The findings of this program are contributing to the development of our RapidVax platform discussed above. 
Platform Assets: RapidVax®
RapidVax® Base Cell: Preclinical Stage
The RapidVax® base cell and core technology are in preclinical development. Combing the immune-activating properties of heat shock protein gp96 and the T-cell co-stimulator OX40L with a customizable antigen expression system, we are evaluating several infectious and emerging diseases as vaccine candidates. RapidVax is designed to utilize a common unprogrammed vaccine base that can be manufactured in bulk, stockpiled, and rapidly customized upon identification of a biological threat to enable an accelerated time to clinic and to harness shared development, clinical safety, and manufacturing synergies. Further details regarding the RapidVax technology can be found in the “RapidVax Platform” section above.

PTX-35: Clinical Stage
PTX-35 is a potential first-in-class selective agonist of DR3. This humanized monoclonal antibody is designed to harness antigen specific immune activation and tolerance mechanisms associated with the DR3 pathway to reprogram immunity and provide a long-term, durable clinical effect. In the absence of a danger or activating signal, co-stimulation of DR3 on T-cells results in the selective expansion of immunosuppressive Tregs that can reduce inflammation. Conversely, co-stimulation of DR3 on T-cells in the presence of a danger or activating signal (arising from injury, infection, or cancer) promotes the expansion of inflammatory effector T-cells that play a critical role in mediating anti-tumor and anti-pathogen responses. Further details regarding the importance of the DR3 pathway in regulating immune responses can be found above in the corresponding platform section.
​
Preclinical studies demonstrate that when combined with HS-110 and HS-130 immunotherapies or an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, PTX-35 has the potential to enhance antigen specific T-cell activation to eliminate tumor cells. With this consideration, we are enrolling an open-label, dose escalation, Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of PTX-35 intravenous administration in patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to, or ineligible for, or who refuse available standard of care. As of June 2020, we treated the first patient and are evaluating escalating dose levels of PTX-35 until an optimal immunological dose or maximum tolerated dose is established to support potential Phase 2 planning. Exploratory analyses include clinical benefit and immunological effects of PTX-35. This trial is supported by a $15.2 million grant from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. 
​
PTX-35 has also been reported as a potent regulatory T-cell (Treg) expander in the absence of a danger or activating signal. Mouse surrogate of PTX-35 (i.e., human CDRs 1-3, but mouse Ig backbone), has shown activity in mouse models of corneal allograft, beta-islet transplantation, bone marrow transplantation, auto/inflammatory models of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), colitis and asthma. Furthermore, on January 12, 2022 we announced in collaboration with Dr. James Shapiro at University of Alberta that a surrogate mouse version of PTX-35 (mPTX-35) could expand regulatory T-cells in vivo to successfully prevent the rejection of allogeneic transplanted beta-isle T-cells in an animal model of type-1 diabetes. 
We are currently evaluating the clinical application for using PTX-35 to expand regulatory T-cell subsets for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases and/or conditions where regulatory T-cells are defective or required to restore immune stability.

Anthim was also approved in 2020 as the only licensed anthrax antitoxin treatment in the EU, UK, and Canada. We will add Anthim to our current biodefense capabilities upon consummation of the pending acquisition of Elusys.
Oncology and Biodefense Market and Current Treatments
Solid Tumors and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that approximately 1.9 million people in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer and ~609,360 cancer-related deaths will occur in 2022. Notably, this number includes approximately 350 deaths per day from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death and the second-most diagnosed cancer in the U.S (approximately 236,740 or 12% of all cases). Approximately 82% of all lung cancer is NSCLC.

Despite continuous advances in cancer screening and the adoption of promising therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs), there remains a significant unmet medical need as published studies demonstrate only a minority of single agent treated patients benefit with prolonged overall survival. Poor response to CPIs is thought to be partly attributable to properties of the tumor microenvironment and the concern that even if the “brake” set by immune checkpoints is released through CPI therapy, optimal antitumor immune responses may not be elicited due to a lack of antigen exposure. These observations have prompted the development of vaccines against cancer antigens that can generate high frequencies of tumor-specific T-cells. We believe the idea of dual immunotherapy with cancer vaccines and CPIs has garnered particular interest based on the hypothesis that the elevated frequencies of tumor-specific T-cells generated by cancer vaccines can be expanded and protected from attenuation through blockade of T-cell checkpoint receptors. 
To date, pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®), Merck’s anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor, atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ®) Roche Genetech’s anti-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor, and cemiplimab (LIBTAYO®), Regeneron’s anti-PD-1 inhibitor, are approved CPIs for the treatment of first-line NSCLC. Per the CPI Global Market Report 2021 the global market for CPIs is anticipated to from approximately $18 billion in 2021 to an estimated $39.8 billion in 2025. iHealthcareAnalyst, Inc estimates the global market for NSCLC therapeutics will grow at a CAGR of 11.4% to reach $22.4 billion by 2027 with the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors segment expected to grow at the fastest rate during forecast period. It is also noted that immunotherapy combinations with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or novel immunomodulatory agents are currently being examined with the hope of achieving higher response rates and improving overall survival rate.
We believe that our novel allogenic “off-the-shelf” cancer vaccine HS-110 is well-positioned as a Phase 2 clinical program with the potential for combination therapy with approved CPIs for the treatment of NSCLC. Further details regarding HS-110 can be found above in the platform asset section.
We believe that our DR3 agonist PTX-35 has the potential in the presence of activating signals (such as cancer antigens) to drive the expansion of anti-tumor lymphocytes and are currently investigating potential solid tumor applications in our Phase I clinical trial. Further details regarding PTX-35 can be found above in the platform asset section.
Strategy
Our objective is to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company specializing in the end-to-end discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that arm the immune system against a wide range of diseases, including cancer and infectious disease. Through the formation of our subsidiary Skunkworx Bio, Inc, we have increased our ability to support in-house nomination of biologics for our preclinical and clinical development. Furthermore, the establishment of our subsidiary Scorpion Biological Services, Inc is part of a company-wide-growth strategy to enhance efficiency and decrease our dependence on third-party contract research and development biomanufacturing organizations (CDMO) as we advance into late-stage clinical trials and translate our other research and development into a commercial pipeline. Finally, the planned acquisition of Elusys Therapeutics, Inc and the addition of the FDA-approved anthrax antitoxin Anthim® (obiltoxaximab) as well as expertise in government funding for development and delivery should support our ability to develop critical therapeutic innovations such as RapidVax® for the biodefense sector. These proceedings reinforce our goal of decreasing the time and increasing the efficiency of drug development to accelerate the delivery of novel immune activating therapies. 
We believe the effective management of cancer will involve multiple agents and that the assets of our gp96 and DR3/TNFRSF25 platforms have the potential to work synergistically with approved immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, to re-stimulate or enhance the immune system’s own anti-tumor response. With this consideration, we are evaluating the potential of the gp96 platform allogenic “off-the-shelf” immunotherapy HS-110 in a Phase 2 NSCLC trial to stimulate tumor-specific T-cell in combination with anti-PD-1 therapies and potentially increase overall survival. The DR3 agonist PTX-35 has been reported to promote the expansion of effector CD8+ T-cells in cancer models in the presence of a danger (activating signal) and is in a Phase 1 solid tumor clinical trial to assess safety and tolerability. 
We believe the DR3 pathway has potential for the management of non-oncology immune disorders as evidenced by literature demonstrating DR3-mediated benefit in several disease models including rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, allergic lung inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease, infectious disease, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

The key elements of our strategy are:

● | Establish a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company specializing in end-to-end delivery of immune stimulating therapies: With the formation of our subsidiaries Skunkworx Bio, Inc and Scorpion Biological Services Inc., we have created a drug development ecosystem designed to fuel innovation, from discovery to commercialization, with minimal reliance on external vendors. This capability offers the potential to translate our discoveries into therapeutics with increased efficiency and quality and without compromising our agility to pursue new innovations. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maximize commercial opportunities for Anthim® (obiltoxaximab) upon the consummation of our pending acquisition of Elusys: We believe that Anthim will continue to be a critical biodefense asset for stockpiling by the CDC’s Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and of potential interest for increasing biosecurity preparedness in commercially approved ex-US ally territories such as the EU, UK, and Canada. Upon the acquisition of Elusys, we intend to be opportunistic in seeking strategic partnerships that maximize economic potential of this asset. We are in the process of completing the tech transfer of this asset to Scorpion for future biomanufacturing; Anthim has previously been manufactured by an external vendor.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maximize commercial opportunities for Scorpion Biological Services, Inc: We plan to launch Scorpion Biological Services, Inc. as a contract research and development biomanufacturing organization (CDMO) focused on developing bioanalytic, process development and biomanufacturing capabilities to support our biotherapeutics and discovery pipeline. We will be opportunistic in offering biomanufacturing capacity to third parties as a fee-for-service model.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Develop and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates: We have completed enrollment of the HS-110 trial in combination with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab to treat patients with advanced NSCLC. We have initiated enrollment of our Phase 1 trial of HS-130 in combination with H-110 for treatment of solid tumors and our Phase 1 trial of PTX-35 for the treatment of solid tumors. Beyond these trials we plan to initiate new clinical trials of combined immunotherapy agents.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maximize commercial opportunity for our technology platforms: Our technologies support the development of product candidates targeting large markets with significant unmet medical needs. For each of our platform assets, we seek to maximize the economic potential of any future U.S. or international commercialization efforts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhance our partnering efforts: We are continually exploring partnerships for licensing and other collaborative relationships and remain opportunistic in seeking strategic partnerships that maximize our economic potential.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Further expand our broad patent portfolio: We have made a significant investment in the development of our patent portfolio to protect our technologies and programs, and we intend to continue to expand our portfolio. We have obtained exclusive rights to six different patent families directed to therapeutic compositions and methods related to our platform and preclinical development programs for cancer, and have filed additional patent applications that are owned by us. The gp96 patent portfolio comprise more than 35 granted patents and 40 pending patent applications. These patents and applications cover the United States, Europe, and Japan, as well as several other countries having commercially significant markets. In total, Pelican holds approximately 65 granted U.S. and foreign patents and approximately 25 U.S. and foreign patents are pending.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Manage our business with efficiency and discipline: We believe we have efficiently utilized our capital and human resources to develop and acquire our product candidates and programs and create a broad intellectual property portfolio. These resources have formed our drug development ecosystem. We use project management techniques to assist us in making disciplined strategic program decisions and to attempt to limit the risk profile of our product pipeline.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pelican Acquisition
On April 28, 2017, we consummated the acquisition of 80% of the outstanding equity of Pelican Therapeutics, Inc. (“Pelican”), a related party, and Pelican became our majority owned subsidiary as contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) that we entered into with Pelican, and certain stockholders of Pelican holding a majority of the outstanding shares.
Pelican is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of monoclonal antibody and fusion protein-based therapies that are designed to activate the immune system. In exchange for 80% of the outstanding capital stock of Pelican on a fully diluted basis, we paid to the Pelican Stockholders that executed the Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Participating Pelican Stockholders”) an aggregate of $0.5 million minus certain liabilities (the “Cash Consideration”), and issued to the Participating Pelican Stockholders 19,015 shares of our restricted common stock representing 4.99% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on the date of the initial execution of the Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Consideration”). The Pelican Stockholders that sold their shares in Pelican to us (the “Participating Pelican Stockholders”) included Jeffrey Wolf, our Chief Executive Officer and a director, John Monahan and Edward Smith, two of our directors, the Chairman of our Scientific Advisory Committee at the time of the closing and/or entities controlled by them. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Cash Consideration of approximately $0.3 million was distributed to the Participating Pelican Stockholders and the remainder of approximately $0.2 million for certain Pelican liabilities not satisfied was retained by us and recognized as other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we distributed to the Participating Pelican Stockholders $2.0 million upon dosing of the first patient in our Phase 1 trial of PTX-35, of which approximately of 22% was distributed to our executive officers and directors who are Participating Pelican Stockholders.
Under the Purchase Agreement, we are also obligated to make future payments based on the achievement of certain clinical and commercialization milestones, as well as low single digit royalty payments and payments upon receipt of sublicensing income:

(1) | $1.5 million upon Pelican’s dosing of the first patient in its first Phase 2 trial for an oncology indication;
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | $3.0 million upon successful outcome of the first Phase 2 trial for an oncology indication;

----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(10) | $3.0 million upon first product indication approval in the United States or Europe for a non- oncology indication.
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On June 22, 2020, the Company achieved the first milestone of $2.0 million when it dosed the first patient in the first Phase 1 clinical trial of PTX-35.
Pelican has been awarded $15.2 million to fund preclinical and some clinical activities from Cancer Prevention Institute of Texas (CPRIT) grant (the “CPRIT Grant”). The CPRIT Grant is subject to customary CPRIT funding conditions including a matching funds requirement where Pelican will match $0.50 for every $1.00 from CPRIT, which totals $7.6 million over the life of the project. 

13



In connection with the Pelican Acquisition, the Participating Pelican Stockholders entered into a Stockholders’ Agreement (the “Stockholders’ Agreement”) with us with respect to the Pelican common stock retained by the Participating Pelican Stockholders (the “Retained Shares”). The Stockholders’ Agreement, contains restrictions on transfer of the Retained Shares and drag-along rights in the event of a consolidation or merger of Pelican with another entity after the date of the Purchase Agreement or the sale of all or substantially all of Pelican’s assets or a transaction in which at least fifty percent (50%) of the voting rights attached to the Pelican securities are sold. In addition, Participating Pelican Stockholders will have co-sale rights in connection with our transfer of the Pelican common stock that we own.
In October 2018, we entered into an agreement with the University of Miami (“UM”) whereby UM exchanged its Pelican Stock shares, of which it owned 5% equity on a fully diluted basis for a certain number of shares along with UM shares in our subsidiary Heat Biologics I, Inc., of which it owned 7.5% equity (together herein the “Subsidiary Shares”) for 5,000 shares of Heat Biologics, Inc. common stock, $0.0002 par value; resulting in Heat owning 85% of Pelican and 100% of its subsidiary Heat Biologics I.
CPRIT Grant
In May 2016, Pelican was awarded a $15.2 million CPRIT Grant from CPRIT for development of Pelican’s lead product candidate, PTX-35. The CPRIT Grant is expected to allow Pelican to develop PTX-35 through a 40-50 patient Phase 1 clinical program. The CPRIT Grant is subject to customary CPRIT funding conditions including a matching funds requirement where Pelican will match $0.50 for every $1.00 from CPRIT. Consequently, Pelican is required to raise $7.6 million in matching funds over the life of the project.
As of December 31, 2021, CPRIT has provided $13.7 million of the total $15.2 million grant. The remaining $1.5 million will be awarded, on a reimbursement basis, after we have fulfilled grant requirements and the grant has been approved to be finalized, rather than in advance of expending the funds as in the prior grant years. As of December 31, 2021, we have provided approximately $7.6 million which was used to satisfy Pelican’s matching fund obligation under the first five years of the CPRIT Grant. 
The CPRIT Grant, as is customary for all CPRIT awards, contains a requirement that Pelican pay CPRIT a royalty on sales of commercial products developed using CPRIT funds equal to between three and five percent of revenue until such time as CPRIT has been paid an aggregate amount equal to 400% of the grant award proceeds. After 400% of the grant award proceeds has been paid, Pelican will pay CPRIT a royalty of 0.5% in perpetuity. After the CPRIT Grant terminates, Pelican is not permitted to retain any unused grant award proceeds without CPRIT’s approval, but Pelican’s royalty and other obligations, including its obligation to repay the disbursed grant proceeds under certain circumstances, to maintain certain records and documentation, to notify CPRIT of certain unexpected adverse events and Pelican’s obligation to use reasonable efforts to ensure that any new or expanded preclinical testing, clinical trials, commercialization or manufacturing related to any aspect of our CPRIT project take place in Texas, survive the termination of the agreement. In addition, if Pelican relocates its principal place of business outside of Texas within the three-year period after the date of final payment of grant funds (which final payment has not yet occurred), we are required to repay to CPRIT all grant funds received. Pelican expects to have received and expended all of the grant award proceeds by the agreement termination date.
The CPRIT Grant is subject to Pelican complying with all terms set forth in the CPRIT Grant, including Pelican maintaining its status with CPRIT as a Texas-based entity. In order to qualify as a Texas-based entity, a company must fulfill a majority of the following seven requirements: (i) its US headquarters must be physically located in Texas; (ii) its chief executive officer must reside in Texas; (iii) a majority of its personnel, including at least two other senior-level employees, must reside in Texas; (iv) its manufacturing activities must take place in Texas; (v) at least 90% of its grant award funds must be paid to individuals and entities in Texas, including salaries and personnel costs for employees and contractors: (vi) at least one clinical trial site must be in Texas; and (vii) it must collaborate with a medical research organization in Texas, including a public or private institution of higher education. Currently, Pelican meets a majority of these seven requirements.

Intellectual Property
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies; preserve our trade secrets and exclusive rights in our unique biological materials; and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the strongest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates and our subsidiaries’, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. See “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Our Business – We have limited protection for our intellectual property, which could impact our competitive position.”
We will continue to depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
Our and our subsidiaries’ programs are supported by growing patent estates that are comprised of intellectual property owned by us and our subsidiaries’, or exclusively licensed from UM. ImPACT®, ComPACT™, PTX-35, and next generation DR3/TNFRSF25 modulators are protected by issued patents and various pending patent applications. In total, Heat holds approximately 35 granted U.S. and foreign patents and approximately 40 U.S. and foreign patents pending. In total, Pelican holds approximately 65 granted U.S. and foreign patents and approximately 25 U.S. and foreign patents are pending.
Heat’s ImPACT® coverage is found in: the “Allogeneic Cancer –Based Immunotherapy” patent family patented in the US (US Patent Nos. 8,475,785 and 9,238,064), Europe, Israel, Australia and Canada and the “Heat Shock Protein GP96 Vaccination and Methods of Using Same” patent family, which is granted in the US (US Patent No. 8,968,720). Both of these patent families are subject to exclusive license agreements with UM and provide protection to 2029 (not including any patent term adjustments or extensions). Various recently filed provisional and international (PCT) patent applications assigned to Heat and relating to ImPACT® are also pending.
Heat’s ComPACT™ technology is covered by US Patent Nos. 10,046,047 and 10,780,161 and a series of patents pending in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions (i.e. Europe, Japan, China, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Israel, India, Korea, Russia, Singapore and South Africa) and assigned to Heat. Various recently filed provisional, international (PCT), US, and foreign patent applications assigned to Heat and related to ComPACT™ are also pending and may provide coverage to 2038 to 2042, if granted (not including any patent term adjustments or extensions).
Pelican’s PTX-35 and next generation DR3/TNFRSF25 modulators coverage stems from three exclusive license agreements with UM (i.e. “UM03-31 UM05-39” of July 11, 2008; “UMI176” of December 12, 2010, as amended December 7, 2020; and “UM-143 UMN-106” of November 19, 2013). Patents are granted or pending in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions (such as Europe, Japan, China, Canada, Australia, Mexico, Korea, Israel, Singapore, and Hong Kong). US Patent No. 9,603,925, with term to 2034 (not including any patent term adjustments or extensions), covers novel DR3/TNFRSF25 modulator compositions in combination with additional therapies. US Patent No. 9,499,627, with term to 2030 (not including any patent term adjustments or extensions), covers novel DR3/TNFRSF25 modulator uses in therapies to delay transplant rejections. US Patent No. 9,839,670, with term to 2026 (not including any patent term adjustments or extensions), covers PTX-35 compositions in combination with a tumor antigen. US Patent No. 9,017,679 with term to 2026 (not including any patent term adjustments or extensions), covers methods of using PTX-35, among other things. Recent patent applications assigned to Pelican are intended to provide further compositional coverage for PTX-35. US Patent Nos. 9,982,057 and 10,005,843 provide composition of matter coverage for PTX-35 and have term to 2035 (not including any patent term adjustments or extensions).

As consideration for the rights granted in each of these three license agreements, Heat Biologics I, Inc. is obligated to pay royalties equal to a percentage (in the low-to-mid single digits) of net sales of products covered by the patent-related rights in the respective license agreements. These royalty rates are subject to reduction if additional license rights from third parties are required to commercialize licensed products. In the event of a sublicense to a third party, Heat Biologics I, Inc. is obligated to pay royalties to UM equal to a percentage of sublicense income. Each of these additional license agreements also provides that the licensee will not have to pay more than the above-noted royalty rates and sublicense fees if more than one license from UM is required to sell products covered by the licensed patent-related rights.
All of the above-described license agreements, as amended, provide that the licensor has the right to terminate a subject license if the licensee: (1) has not introduced, or at least used its best efforts to introduce, a licensed product in the commercial marketplace in the United States, European Union, or Japan by December 31, 2025; (2) has not otherwise exercised diligence to bring licensed products to market; or (3) files, or has filed against it, a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Act, is adjudged insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or has an unreleased or unsatisfied writ of attachment or execution levied upon it. Upon an uncured material breach of an obligation under any one of the above license agreements by a party, the other party has the right to terminate that agreement upon 90 days’ notice or 30 days’ notice if the breach relates to payments due to UM. In the event of a termination, Heat Biologics I, Inc. will be obligated to pay all amounts that accrued prior to such termination. Each of the above license agreements also contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements between industry and academia, including the licensee’s agreement to indemnify UM for liabilities arising out of the negligence of the licensee, making the license grant subject to the Bayh-Dole act (35 U.S.C. 200 et seq.), the reservation of the licensor of the right to use the licensed intellectual property rights for its internal, non-commercial purposes, limitations/disclaimers of various warranties and representations, reporting and record-keeping requirements, and licensee liability insurance requirements.
In June 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Shattuck Labs, Inc. (“Shattuck”) pursuant to which we licensed to Shattuck certain provisional patent applications and know-how related to fusion proteins to treat cancer and other diseases that were not being developed by us. Shattuck paid us an initial license fee of $50,000 and is obligated to pay us fees upon its receipt of sublicensing income, achievement of certain milestones and royalties upon sales of commercial products. The technology that was out-licensed to Shattuck is in the early stages of development and there is a low likelihood of success for any technology at such stage, there can be no assurance that any products will be developed by Shattuck or that we will derive any revenue from Shattuck.

External Manufacturing
We have historically relied on third-party manufacturers to produce and store our product candidates for clinical use and currently do not operate our own manufacturing facilities. In order to promote efficiency and reduce our reliance on third-

17



party vendors, we plan to enhance our in-house development of bioanalytic, process development and manufacturing capabilities and offer such services to third parties for fees. We have entered into a lease for a 20,144 square foot facility in San Antonio, TX to conduct such services and are currently building the facility. Our proposed expansion in Texas is part of a company-wide-growth strategy to enhance efficiency and decrease our dependence on third-party vendors as we advance our clinical trials and general research and development. Operations at the facility are projected to commence by the second quarter of 2022, and we expect to fill production capacity by transitioning our outsourced manufacturing and development to in-house immediately, followed by contracting with external customers. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these new operations. See the Key Capabilities section above for additional details.
The HS-110 product used in the inventor’s Phase 1, and in our Phase 2 clinical trial was manufactured under cGMP (current good manufacturing practices). The gp96 cell line is grown in large quantities, dispensed into individual doses, frozen in liquid nitrogen, irradiated to render cell replication incompetent and quality tested in compliance with FDA guidelines. Irradiation is a commonly used attenuation process that eliminates the ability of the gp96-Ig-containing cell lines to replicate but allows the cells to remain metabolically active and secrete gp96-Ig. The batches of frozen, irradiated drug product are stable for long periods of time and are thawed immediately prior to administration to patients.
The HS-130 product is being evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial for the treatment of select solid tumors. This product utilizes our ComPACT™ technology concept, which is designed to deliver the gp96 heat shock (HS-110) protein and a T-cell co-stimulatory fusion protein (OX40L) in HS-130. We have completed the cGMP manufacturing and nonclinical IND enabling activities to support the clinical development of this product.
PTX-35 is being evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial for the treatment of select solid tumors We have utilized an external vendor for the manufacture of PTX-35 and are planning the tech transfer of this asset to Scorpion for future biomanufacturing. 
Anthim® (obiltoxaximab) is a best-in-class monoclonal antibody antitoxin for anthrax. Anthim received FDA approval and orphan drug exclusivity in 2016 for the treatment of inhalational anthrax, in combination with antibiotics, and as a prophylaxis when alternative therapies are not available or are not appropriate. Anthim was also approved in 2020 as the only licensed anthrax anti-toxin treatment in the EU, UK, and Canada. Anthim has previously been manufactured by an external vendor. We are in the process of completing the tech transfer of this asset to Scorpion for future biomanufacturing.

Competition
The pharmaceutical, biologics and the diagnostic industry is highly competitive and characterized by several established large companies, mid-sized companies, as well as smaller companies like ours. If our competitors’ market products that are less expensive, safer, or more effective than any future products developed from our product candidates, or that reach the market before our approved product candidates, we may not achieve commercial success. Technological developments in our field of research and development occur at a rapid rate and we expect competition to intensify as advances in this field are made. We will be required to continue to devote substantial resources and efforts to our research and development activities. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. 
Oncology
As a biotechnology company with cancer immunotherapy agents as lead product candidates, we compete with a broad range of companies. At the highest level, cancer immunotherapy can be seen as both a complement and a potential competitor to any oncology therapy, most notably chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biologics and small molecule drugs. Not only do we compete with companies engaged in various cancer treatments including radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but we also compete with various companies that have developed or are trying to develop immunology vaccines for the treatment of cancer. 
Certain of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources, large customer bases, broader product lines, sales forces, greater marketing and management resources, larger research and development staffs with extensive facilities and equipment than we do and have more established reputations as well as global distribution channels. These companies might also succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive products more rapidly than we can for our products. 

18



Our most significant oncology competitors, among others, are fully integrated pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly and Company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, MedImmune, LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc), Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc., MerckKGaA and Sanofi SA, and more established biotechnology companies such as Genentech, Inc. (a member of the Roche Group), Amgen Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc. and its subsidiary Kite Pharma, Inc., and competing cancer immunotherapy companies such as, Bluebird Bio, Inc., Transgene SA, Agenus Inc., Advaxis, Inc., IMV Inc., Bavarian Nordic A/S, Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., and others. 
We expect to compete for market share against large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, new companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations, and our competitors may develop and market products that are less expensive, more effective, or safer than our future products; commercialize competing products before we can launch any products developed from our product candidates; operate larger research and development programs, possess greater manufacturing capabilities or have substantially greater financial resources than we do; initiate or withstand substantial price competition more successfully than we can; have greater success in recruiting skilled technical and scientific workers from the limited pool of available talent; more effectively negotiate third-party licenses and strategic relationships; and take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can.
The primary treatments for non-small cell lung cancer are surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies and various combinations of each of these treatments. Many patients, particularly with advanced disease, are refractory to these treatments and are subsequently treated with several emerging biologic agents, including immunotherapy. Some examples of therapies commonly attempted with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients include: Opdivo® (nivolumab), Keytruda® (pembrolizumab), TECENTRIQ® (atezolizumab), LIBTAYO® (cemiplimab), Alimta® (pemetrexed), Avastin® (bevacizumab), Tarceva® (erlotinib), Gemzar® (gemcitabine), Paraplatin® (carboplatin), Taxol® (paclitaxel), Taxotere® (docetaxel), and Navelbine® (vinorelbine). 
Despite the promise of checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) such as pembrolizumab, there remains a significant unmet medical need as published studies demonstrate only a minority of single agent treated patients benefit with prolonged overall survival. Poor response to CPIs is thought to be partly attributable to properties of the tumor microenvironment and the concern that even if the “brake” set by immune checkpoints is released through CPI therapy, optimal antitumor immune responses may not be elicited due to a lack of antigen exposure. These observations have prompted the development of vaccines against cancer antigens that can generate high frequencies of tumor-specific T-cells. We believe the idea of dual immunotherapy with cancer vaccines and CPIs has garnered particular interest based on the hypothesis that the elevated frequencies of tumor-specific T-cells generated by cancer vaccines can be expanded and protected from attenuation through blockade of T-cell checkpoint receptors.
Our strategy is to emphasize what we believe to be our competitive advantages, which is that our products in development are expected to have less side effects than most other cancer therapies, the potential for enhanced overall survival in combination with approved therapies, may be available at lower prices than other therapies, and the potential to demonstrate efficacy in a number of oncology indications.
Biodefense
We anticipate our most significant competitor for Anthim® (obiltoxaximab) will be Emergent BioSolutions, Inc (Emergent). Emergent is the provider of the anthrax anti-toxin raxibacumab. Raxibacumab received FDA approval on December 14, 2012, while Anthim received FDA approval on March 18, 2016. Anthim and raxibacumab both inhibit the binding of anthrax toxin protective antigen (PA) to its cellular receptors, preventing the intracellular entry of the anthrax lethal factor and edema factor, the enzymatic toxin components responsible for the pathogenic effects of anthrax toxin. However, package inserts demonstrate that Anthim has a higher affinity equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) at 0.33 compared to 2.78 nM of raxibacumab and a long-shelf life at 7 years for the final drug product. Anthim and raxibacumab have been supplied to the CDC’s strategic national stockpile. We anticipate based on previous delivery orders and option agreements that Anthim will continue to fulfill delivery orders as part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness & Response’s (ASPR) objective to diversify and acquire products with a longer shelf-life.

19



Internationally, Anthim was approved in 2020 as the only licensed anthrax antitoxin treatment in the European Union, United Kingdom, and Canada. In Canada, the approval of Anthim blocks future purchases of raxibacumab without Canadian Extraordinary-Use New Drug (EUND) approval. In the European Union, orphan drug exclusivity (10 year) at time of approval blocks competitors. We believe these approvals position Anthim well for increasing biosecurity preparedness in commercially approved ex-US ally territories and will be opportunistic in seeking strategic partnerships that maximize economic potential of this asset.
Contract Development Biomanufacturing Organization (CDMO)
We formed the subsidiary Scorpion Biological Services, Inc. to focus on developing bioanalytic, process development and biomanufacturing capability to support our biotherapeutics and discovery pipeline. We plan to offer excess biomanufacturing capacity to third parties as a fee-for-service CDMO model. Scorpion Biological Services is focused on cell- and gene-based therapies and large molecule biologics. We provide a broad array of biologics manufacturing, analytical and R&D services, offering services using American-made equipment, reagents, and materials. Scorpion couples cGMP biomanufacturing and quality control expertise with cutting edge capabilities in immunoassays, molecular assays, and bioanalytical methods to support the advancement of our development and commercial programs. 
​
Considering our capabilities, we anticipate providing competition to established biomanufacturers including Lonza Group, Ltd and WuXi AppTec as well as recently announced biomanufacturing efforts from ThermoFisher Scientific, Inc. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed a critical shortage in US biomanufacturing capacity. Historically therapies could often take ~10 years to commercialize. However, with the implementation of the Emergency Use Authorization, complex, effective vaccines sped through pipelines at record speed and created new expectations for time to market, cost reduction, regulatory compliance, and good manufacturing performance. Considering the global cell and gene therapy clinical trials market size was valued at $9.2 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.3% from 2021 to 2028 per Grand View Research, we anticipate that a shortage of industry capacity may minimize the risk of direct competition.

Government Regulation
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (the “FDC Act”), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act which governs the approval of new drug applications, or NDAs. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, via a Biologics License Application, or BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are 

20



submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug or biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (1) in compliance with federal regulations; (2) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (3) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug or biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug or biologic. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs and BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to an annual program fee. These fees are typically increased annually.
The FDA undertakes to perform an initial filing review within 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs. Most such applications for standard review drug or biologic products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs or biologics are reviewed in six to eight months. The FDA can extend these reviews by three months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. For biologics, priority review is further limited only for products intended to treat a serious or life-

21



threatening disease relative to the currently approved products. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug or biologic products, or drug or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee – typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts – for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, is satisfactory and the NDA or BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug or biologic is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or nine months depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug or biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained, or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA or NDA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA or BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs or BLAs.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses, known as ’off-label’ use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, if the physicians deem to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain 

22



state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
Additional Controls for Biologics
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
Cell and Tissue-Based Biologics
Establishments that manufacture cell and tissue-based products must comply with the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or cGTP, which are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of such products. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that T-cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also include requirements for a unified registration and listing system, donor screening and testing, adverse reaction reporting, and labeling.
Cell and tissue-based products may also be subject to the same approval standards, including demonstration of safety and efficacy, as other biologic and drug products if they meet certain criteria such as if the cells or tissues are more than minimally manipulated or if they are intended for a non-homologous use. Products manufactured using the ImPACT® technology meet this threshold and therefore are considered biological drugs. Manufacture of ImPACT® products are subject to both cGTP and cGMP regulations for manufacturing quality. Marketing of these products in the United States will require FDA approval under the BLA pathway as discussed above.

23



Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for instance the Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the physician payment transparency laws, the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and similar state laws, each as amended.
The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The anti-kickback statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, however, does not make the conduct per se illegal under the anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Violations of this law are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
Additionally, the intent standard under the anti-kickback statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act., as discussed below.
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, drug manufacturers can be held liable under the federal civil False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services; making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim; or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, if approved, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted 

24



under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal anti-kickback statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct business. HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and their respective implementing regulations. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which include health care providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouse, that create, receive, or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, some of which are more stringent and many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties.
Additionally, the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to annually report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, or CMS, information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must also comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to it, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, 

25



reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.
Strict data privacy laws regulating the collection, transmission, storage and use of employee data and consumers’ personally-identifying information are evolving in the European Union, U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Outside of the United States, the laws, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, and other processing of personal information. For example, in the European Union, the collection and use of personal data is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”). The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the European Union member states governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations on entities subject to the GDPR, including but not limited to: (i) accountability and transparency requirements, and enhanced requirements for obtaining valid consent from data subjects; (ii) obligations to consider data protection as any new products or services are developed and to limit the amount of personal data processed; (iii) obligations to comply with the data protection rights of data subjects; and (iv) obligations to report certain personal data breaches to governmental authorities and individuals. Data protection authorities from the different E.U. member states and other European countries may enforce the GDPR and national data protection laws differently, and introduce additional national regulations and guidelines, which adds to the complexity of processing European personal data. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws may result in significant monetary fines and other administrative penalties (the GDPR authorizes fines for certain violations of up to 4% of global annual revenue or €20 million, whichever is greater) as well as civil liability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed. Additionally, expenses associated with compliance could reduce our operating margins.
The GDPR also prohibits the transfer of personal data from the E.U. to countries outside of the E.U. unless made to a country deemed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection for personal data or accomplished by means of an approved data transfer mechanism (e.g., standard contractual clauses).

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to that third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost- effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the 

26



cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect the pressure on healthcare pricing will continue to increase. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.
Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. It is unclear how these challenges and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact our business in the future.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. Additionally, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
We anticipate that current and future U.S. legislative healthcare reforms may result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
Non-U.S. Regulation
Before our products can be marketed outside of the United States, they are subject to regulatory approval of the respective authorities in the country in which the product should be marketed. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices might not be approved for such product.
In Europe, marketing authorizations may be submitted at a centralized, a decentralized or national level; however, the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all European Union member states. There can be no assurance that the chosen regulatory strategy will secure regulatory approval on a timely basis or at all.

While we intend to market our products outside the United States in compliance with our respective license agreements, we have not made any applications with non-U.S. authorities and have no timeline for such applications or marketing.
Research and Development
We have built an internal and external research and development organization that includes expertise in discovery research, preclinical development, product formulation, analytical chemistry, manufacturing, clinical development and regulatory and quality assurance. Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Our cancer trials have been registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development. Research and development expenses were $18.8 million and $12.9 million during both years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

financial statements. We will cease to be a smaller reporting company if we have (i) more than $250 million in market value of our shares held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (ii) more than $100 million of annual revenues in our most recent fiscal year completed before the last business day of our second fiscal quarter and a market value of our shares held by non-affiliates more than $700 million as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. 
On December 11, 2020, we effected a one-for-seven- reverse stock split. All per share numbers reflect the one-for seven reverse stock split.
Human Capital
We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop, retain and motivate key personnel. Our management and scientific teams possess considerable experience in drug discovery, research and development, manufacturing, clinical and regulatory affairs and believe we directly benefit from this experience and industry knowledge. Our research team comprises B.S., M.S. and Ph.D.-level scientists with expertise in oncology, immunology, and molecular biology.
As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 49 full-time employees, of which 14 are part of our research team located in San Antonio, Texas, 16 are part of our research team located in Morrisville, North Carolina, 4 are part of our research team located in New Brunswick, New Jersey and 15 are part of our corporate team. We anticipate increasing our headcount upon the consummation of the pending acquisition of Elusys. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We anticipate that we will need to identify, attract, train and retain other highly skilled personnel to pursue our development program. Hiring for such personnel is competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or attract, assimilate or retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.
We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Although, management continually seeks to add additional talent to its work force, management believes that it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. 
Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically:

● | we provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we align our executives’ long-term equity compensation with our shareholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | annual increases and incentive compensation are based on merit, which is communicated to employees at the time of hiring and documented through our talent management process as part of our annual review procedures and upon internal transfer and/or promotion; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | all employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a 401K retirement plan with employer matching contributions (maximum of 4% match) and life and disability/accident coverage. We also offer a variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including flexible time-off, telemedicine, and paid parental leave.

Accordingly, with the global spread of the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, we have implemented plans designed to address and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the safety of our employees and our business, which include:

● | adding work from home flexibility;
--+-----------------------------------


● | adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay home;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increasing cleaning protocols across all locations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | initiating regular communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures.
