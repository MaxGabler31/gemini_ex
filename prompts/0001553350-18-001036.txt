BUSINESS

Company Overview

Pro-Dex, Inc. (Company, Pro-Dex, we, our, us) specializes in the design, development and manufacture of autoclavable, battery-powered and electric, multi-function surgical drivers and shavers used primarily in the orthopedic and maxocranial facial markets. We have patented adaptive torque-limiting software and proprietary sealing solutions which appeal to our customers, primarily medical device distributors. We also manufacture and sell rotary air motors to a wide range of industries.

Through May 2018, our Fineline Molds (Fineline) division, acquired in fiscal 2015, manufactured plastic injection molding for a variety of industries. We sold the assets and business operations of our Fineline division and the assets related to that division have been reclassified as assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2017.

Through April 2017, we provided engineering consulting and placement services, as well as quality and regulatory consulting services through our Engineering Services Division (ESD). Although we continue to provide engineering, quality and regulatory consulting services to our customers, we have ceased placement services and accordingly have disbanded our ESD Division. The cessation of placement services did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Through January 2017, our OMS Division designed and manufactured multi-axis motion control systems used in factory automation and scientific research markets. We sold substantially all of the assets and the business operations of our OMS division located in Beaverton, Oregon to our long time general manager of the division. This division has been classified as a discontinued operation in conformity with applicable accounting guidance. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, OMSs results have been reported as discontinued operations and removed from all financial discussions of continuing operations. (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this report).

In fiscal 2015, we acquired Huber Precision (Huber), a business that made custom machined parts. We made the investment to garner a wider customer base, but the sales to the customers that were serviced by Huber dwindled over time, such that activities have become immaterial. As a result, the intangible assets relating to Huber were impaired during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

Description of Business

The majority of our revenue is derived from designing, developing and manufacturing surgical devices for the medical device industry. The proportion of total sales by type is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):

 | Years Ended June 30, | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 
 | (In thousands) | 
 | | | % of Revenue | | | | % of Revenue
Medical device and services | $ | 20,282 | | 90 | % | $ | 18,584 | 85 | %
Industrial and scientific | | 826 | | 4 | % | | 882 | 4 | %
Dental and component | | 596 | | 3 | % | | 786 | 4 | %
Repairs | | 394 | | 2 | % | | 302 | 1 | %
Other | | 367 | | 1 | % | | 1,389 | 6 | %
Total Sales | $ | 22,465 | | 100 | % | $ | 21,943 | 100 | %


Our medical device products utilize proprietary designs developed by us primarily under exclusive development and supply agreements and are manufactured in our Irvine, California facility, as are our dental products. Our medical device products are sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers and our dental products are sold primarily to dental product distributors. In our San Dimas, California facility we manufactured plastic injection molds for a wide variety of industries through May 2018, upon which time we sold the division and terminated our obligations under the lease for the San Dimas facility. The proportion of total sales by facility is as follows:
 

 | Years Ended June 30, | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 
 | (In thousands) | 
 | | | % of Revenue | | | | % of Revenue
Irvine | $ | 22,107 | | 98 | % | $ | 20,987 | 96 | %
San Dimas | | 358 | | 2 | % | | 956 | 4 | %
Total Sales | $ | 22,465 | | 100 | % | $ | 21,943 | 100 | %


In fiscal 2018, our top 20 customers accounted for 97% of our sales compared to 94% in fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2018, we had one customer, included in medical device revenue above, that accounted for 56% of sales with our next largest customer accounting for 12% of sales. This compares to fiscal 2017, when we had one customer, included in medical device revenue above, that accounted for 50% of our revenue and no other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. In many cases, including our largest customers, disclosure of customer names is prohibited by confidentiality agreements with such entities. We have no plans to discontinue the sales relationships with our existing significant customers.

Our business today is almost entirely driven by sales of our medical devices. Many of our significant customers place purchase orders for specific products that were developed under various development and/or supply agreements. Our customers may request that we design and manufacture a custom surgical device or they may hire us as a contract manufacturer to manufacture a product of their own design. In either case, we have extensive experience with autoclavable, battery-powered and electric, multi-function surgical drivers and shavers. We continue to focus a significant percentage of our time and resources on providing outstanding products and service to our valued principal customers. Additionally, we continue to invest in machinery and equipment to increase our machining through-put.

Simultaneously, we are working to build top-line sales through active proposals of new medical device products with new and existing customers. Our patented adaptive torque-limiting software has been very well received in the CMF market and we have continued investment in this area with research and development focused on applying this technology to thoracic surgical applications. We invested significantly during fiscal 2018 on a thoracic driver utilizing adaptive torque-limiting software, and in early fiscal 2019, entered a development contract with a current significant customer to private-label this driver for their unique specifications. We anticipate sales to this existing customer will increase late in fiscal 2019 as we add this product to their existing CMF driver and ancillary products that we currently supply.

In April 2017, we invested in Monogram Orthopaedics Inc. (Monogram), a medical device start-up specializing in precision, patient-specific orthopedic implants. In conjunction with making the loan to Monogram, we were granted the exclusive right to develop, engineer, manufacture and supply certain products on behalf of Monogram. We impaired our entire $800,000 investment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 due to indications that Monogram had exhausted its cash and had been unable to obtain additional financing to enable continued research to commercialize their technology. While we do not expect to recover our investment, if Monogram successfully raises the funds needed to commercialize their technology, we expect to generate future revenue streams pursuant to our contractual development and supply rights with them.

The majority of the raw materials and components used to manufacture our products are purchased and are available from several sources, including through our own in-house machining capabilities. Portescap, K-V Engineering, and Fischer Connectors are examples of key suppliers. We have no exclusive arrangements with any of our suppliers, but in several instances only one supplier is used for certain high-value components. In most of such instances, secondary suppliers have been identified, although it is likely that any transition to a new or different supplier would result in a delay in the supply chain. We consider our relationships with our suppliers and manufacturers to be good. We do not intend to terminate any such relationship at this time, nor does management have knowledge that any supplier or manufacturer intends to terminate its relationship with us.

Our commitment to product design, manufacturing and quality systems are supported by our compliance with several regulatory agency requirements and standards. We hold a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Establishment Registration and a State of California Device Manufacturing License (Department of Public Health Food and Drug Branch) with respect to our Irvine, California facility. In addition, our Irvine, California facility is certified to ISO 13485:2003, Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC  Annex II, and Canadian Medical Device Conformity Assessment System.

At June 30, 2018, we had a backlog of $12.3 million compared with a backlog of $8.7 million at June 30, 2017. Our backlog represents firm purchase orders received and acknowledged from our customers and does not include all revenue expected to be generated from existing customer contracts. Our entire backlog at June 30, 2018 is expected to be delivered during fiscal 2019. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, variability in our new order bookings due to, among other reasons, the launch of new products, the timing of customer orders based on end-user demand, and customer inventory levels. We do not typically experience seasonal fluctuations in our shipments and revenues.

Segments

With the sale of the OMS division during fiscal 2017, we no longer have separate reportable segments. The OMS division was historically the only division that was significant enough to require segment disclosures and as such, effective with this divestiture, we no longer require segment disclosure as our business is currently run.

Competition

The markets for products in the industries served by our customers are intensely competitive, and we face significant competition from a number of different sources. Several of our competitors have significantly greater name recognition, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, product development and marketing resources, than us.

We compete in all of our markets with other major medical device companies. As a provider of outsourced services, we also compete with our customers own internal development and manufacturing groups. Competitive pressures and other factors, such as new product or new technology introductions by us, our customers internal development and manufacturing departments, or our competitors, may result in price or market share erosion that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, there can be no assurance that our products and services will achieve broad market acceptance or will successfully compete with other products targeting the same customers.

Research and Development

We conduct research and development activities to both maintain and improve our market position. Our research and development effort involves the design and manufacture of products that perform specific applications for our existing and prospective customers. Our research and development activities are focused on:

· | expanding our knowledge base in the medical device industry to solidify our products with current customers and expand our customer base;
· | advancing applicable technologies; and 
· | enhancing our product lines. 


In certain instances we may share research and development costs with our customers by billing for non-recurring engineering services. Revenue recognized for non-recurring engineering services represented 1% and 4% of our revenue in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. During recent years, we have entered into certain development and supply contracts, the development portions of which provide for billable non-recurring engineering service fees. Such fees are recognized as revenue generally upon milestone completion or completion of the product development services. The revenue earned during fiscal 2018 relating to non-recurring engineering services was not material. During fiscal 2017, we completed the development of a surgical handpiece for a customer and began shipping products to this customer. Revenue for this development contract was recorded under the milestone completion method and we recognized revenue of $752,000 and $367,000 during fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. We will continue to pursue other revenue-generating development projects and in that regard we have two such development contracts, one executed in late fiscal 2018 and one in early fiscal 2019, expected to generate approximately $700,000 of non-recurring engineering services revenue during fiscal 2019. Accordingly, we believe that non-recurring engineering fees could represent a greater share of our revenue in the future, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these endeavors.

During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, we incurred research and development expenses amounting to $1.9 million and $1.2 million, respectively, which costs exclude labor and related expenses of approximately $46,000 and $130,000 in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, that were reimbursed by our customers through billings for non-recurring engineering services.

Employees

At June 30, 2018, we had 80 employees as well as 1 temporary employee all working at our corporate office in Irvine, California. Since we sold our Fineline division in May 2018, we have no employees in San Dimas, California at June 30, 2018. At June 30, 2017, we had 76 employees, comprised of 70 employees in Irvine, California and 6 in San Dimas, California, as well as 5 temporary employees working in Irvine, California. None of our employees are a party to any collective bargaining agreements with us. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.

Government Regulations

The manufacture and distribution of medical and dental devices are subject to state and federal requirements set forth by various agencies, including the FDA, and state medical and dental boards. The statutes, regulations, administrative orders, and advisories that affect our businesses are complex and subject to diverse, often conflicting, interpretations. While we make every effort to maintain full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, we are unable to eliminate the ongoing risk that one or more of our activities or devices may at some point be determined to be non-compliant. The penalties for non-compliance could range from an administrative warning to termination of a portion of our business. Furthermore, even if we are subsequently determined to have fully complied with applicable laws or regulations, the costs to achieve such a determination and the intervening loss of business could adversely affect or result in the cessation of a portion of our business. A change in such laws or regulations at any time may have an adverse effect on our operations.

The FDA designates all medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device (with Class I requiring the lowest level of control and Class III requiring the greatest level of control). The surgical instrumentation we manufacture is generally classified into Class I, and our dental instrumentation is generally classified into Class II. The FDA has broad enforcement powers to recall and prohibit the sale of products that do not comply with federal regulations, and to order the cessation of non-compliant processes. No claim has been made to date by the FDA regarding any of our products or processes. Nevertheless, as is common in the industry, certain of our products and processes have been the subject of routine governmental reviews and investigations.

The total cost of providing health care services has been and will continue to be subject to review by governmental agencies and legislative bodies in the major world markets, including the United States, which are faced with significant pressure to lower health care costs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act signed into law in March 2010 (the Affordable Care Act) imposes a 2.3% excise tax, currently suspended until December 31, 2019, on sales of certain medical devices, some of which we produce, that we may be unable to recover through price increases to our customers.

We believe that our business is conducted in a manner consistent with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other agency regulations governing disposition of industrial waste materials.

While we believe that our products and processes fully comply with applicable laws and regulations, we are unable to predict the outcome of any investigation or review which may be undertaken in the future with respect to our products or processes.

Management believes that each of our facilities has manufacturing systems and processes that are based on established Quality Management System standards. In addition, we believe that our Irvine, California facility is compliant with applicable Good Manufacturing Practices promulgated by the FDA, and is compliant with applicable ISO standards set forth by the International Organization for Standardization.

Patents, Trademarks and Licensing Agreements

We hold patents relating to miniature rotary drive products and torque-limiting screwdrivers. Our patents have varying expiration dates. The near term expiration of the patents, if any, is not expected to cause any change in our revenue-generating operations as the revenue from the products associated with those patents is not material.

We have no reason to believe that our activities infringe upon the intellectual property of any third party. With respect to our own patents, we have no reason to believe that our patents are invalid and we believe that at least some of our patents cover certain aspects of our products. While we are unaware of any reason that would cause us to assert or defend a claim of patent infringement, any such assertion or defense could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations due to the costs involved.

We have certain federally registered trademarks relating to our products, including Pro-Dex®, along with a number of other common law trademarks.

We have not entered into any franchising agreements. We have not granted nor do we hold any third-party licenses having terms under which we earn revenue or incur expense in material amounts.
