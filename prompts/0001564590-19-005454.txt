Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 Avalara’s motto is “Tax compliance done right.” The rise of digital commerce and international trade, coupled with constantly shifting taxation and reporting obligations imposed by the global patchwork of local, regional, state, and national taxing authorities, has created a tremendously complex and onerous compliance burden for businesses of all sizes. Avalara’s mission is to provide solutions for this challenge, allowing companies to focus on their core operations. We provide a leading suite of cloud-based solutions designed to improve accuracy and efficiency by automating the processes of determining taxability, identifying applicable tax rates, determining and collecting taxes, preparing and filing returns, remitting taxes, maintaining tax records, and managing compliance documents. Our vision is to be part of every transaction in the world. 
 Thousands of local, regional, state, and national taxing authorities in the United States and internationally impose a variety of transaction taxes that businesses operating in those jurisdictions collect from customers. Businesses must comply with these transaction tax obligations, which require determination, collection, and remittance of taxes, as well as maintaining records of registrations, taxes collected, tax e
xemption certificates, and other compliance documents. Transaction tax rules and regulations change frequently and are neither intuitive nor consistent across taxing jurisdictions, of which there are more than 12,000 sales and use tax jurisdictions in the United States alone, creating a massively complex compliance challenge. Determining the tax due on a particular sale depends not only on the precise geographic location of the transaction within the relevant taxing jurisdictions and the classification of the product or service in one of thousands of categories, it can also vary because of temporary tax incentives that change the tax rate for specific products, time periods, and transaction thresholds. Further complications arise from the thousands of rule changes enacted every year as taxing authorities amend their tax rates and taxability rules, modify jurisdictional boundaries, and implement other regulatory changes. 
 In addition to being complex, transaction tax determinations often must be performed and communicated to various invoice-generating systems in real time, at the time of the transaction. Compliance is even more burdensome for businesses required to collect tax on numerous products or services in multiple jurisdictions, which is increasingly common with the rise of ecommerce, globalization, and omnichannel retailing. 
 Today, many businesses attempt to handle transaction tax compliance processes manually, often through the use of static tax tables in spreadsheet software and reliance on internal staff to track relevant transaction tax requirements and changes. Businesses relying on manual processes for transaction tax compliance risk miscalculations and incorrect collections, which can result in customer dissatisfaction and financial penalties. Many businesses conduct transactions using business applications such as accounting, enterprise resource planning (ERP), ecommerce, point of sale (POS), recurring billing, and customer relationship management (CRM) systems. Although these systems may include rudimentary tax calculation capabilities, they are not sufficiently robust or current to provide accurate tax determinations for many businesses. 
 The Avalara Compliance Cloud combines an advanced database of broad, deep, and up-to-date tax content with technology for executing compliance processes, including tax determination, tax document management, and returns preparation and filing. Our platform powers a suite of solutions that enable businesses to address the complexity of transaction tax compliance, process transactions in real time, produce detailed records of transaction tax determinations, and reduce errors, audit exposure, and total transaction tax compliance costs. Businesses that use our solutions can allocate fewer personnel to manage transaction tax compliance and focus their efforts on core business operations. 
 The Avalara Compliance Cloud is designed to integrate seamlessly with our customers’ business applications and be easy to administer and maintain. As transactions are executed in our c
ustomers’ business applications, the Avalara Compliance Cloud performs a series of operations to deliver tax compliance functionality in real time. We enable this through our more than 700 pre-built integrations that are designed to link the Avalara Compliance Cloud to business applications used for accounting, ERP, ecommerce, POS, recurring billing, and CRM systems. These integrations typically require little customer configuration or ongoing oversight. Our cloud architecture ensures that our tax content updates are immediately and automatically applied to our customers’ transactions. Our powerful and intuitive web-based console simplifies configuration and unifies administration, reporting, and returns processing across a customer’s multiple business applications.

As a result of our competitive strengths, our platform becomes deeply embedded in our customers’ business processes and systems, providing them with an automated solution central to their ability to transact. Our strategic position drives long-term customer relationships, as evidenced by our net revenue retention rate, which was 107% on average for the four quarters ended December 31, 2018. 
 Businesses across industries and of all sizes, ranging from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies, use our solutions. Mid-market customers, with 20 to 500 employees, have been and remain our primary target market segment for marketing and selling our solutions. Our diverse customer base included approximately 9,070 core customers as of December 31, 2018. 
 A summary of our core customers and net revenue retention rate is as follow: 
 
 
 | Dec 31, 2018 | | Sep 30, 2018 | | Jun 30, 2018 | Mar 31, 2018 | Dec 31, 2017 | | Sep 30, 2017 | | Jun 30, 2017 | Mar 31, 2017
-----------------------------------------------------+--------------+-------+--------------+-------+--------------+--------------+--------------+-------+--------------+-------+--------------+-------------
Number of core customers (as of end of period) | | 9,070 | | 8,490 | | 8,080 | | 7,760 | | 7,490 | | 7,250 | 6,970 | 6,650
Net revenue retention rate | 108% | | 105% | | 108% | 109% | 105% | | 107% | | 106% | 109% 

 
For additional information regarding these metrics, see section title “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Business Metrics.”
 In 2018, our core customers represented more than 85% of our total revenue. As the offerings on our platform have expanded, so too has our addressable customer base. Our number of core customers represents less than half of our total number of customers and does not include a substantial number of customers of various sizes who do not meet the revenue threshold to be considered a core customer. Many of these customers are in the small business and self-serve segment of the marketplace, which represents strategic value and a growth opportunity for us. Customers who do not meet the revenue threshold to be considered a core customer provide us with market share and awareness, and we anticipate that some may grow into core customers. While most of our revenue is currently generated by customers located in the United States, we support transaction tax compliance in Europe, South America, and Asia, and we are continuing to expand our international presence. 
 We sell our solutions primarily on a subscription basis. We target most prospects via cost-effective digital marketing strategies and qualify them using predictive analytics. The majority of our sales, to new and existing customers, are direct and conducted via telephone, requiring minimal in-person interaction. In some cases, particularly for customers with larger and more complex needs, we conduct in-person sales. Our sales force also manages a network of business application providers and other customer referral sources that provide us with qualified leads and, in some cases, purchase functionality from us for use by their customers. Our small business customers can subscribe to our solutions via an automated, self-service ordering process. 
 We have acquired and integrated multiple businesses, primarily to augment the tax content of the Avalara Compliance Cloud, serve the needs of businesses in different geographies or industries, or improve our ability to serve all aspects of transaction tax compliance. Substantial portions of our business, including our tax return preparation and filing and our compliance document management solutions, are based on acquired content and technology. Since 2014 we have acquired fuel excise tax, lodging tax, communications tax, portions of European VAT, and Brazilian tax solutions. In 2018, we acquired technology assets to facilitate cross-border transactions (e.g. tariffs and duties).  We intend to continue pursuing opportunities to broaden our suite of solutions and international presence, and integrating new content and solutions. In January 2019, we acquired the operating assets of Compli, Inc., a provider of compliance services and technology to producers, distributors, and importers of alcoholic beverages in the United States. In February 2019, we acquired intellectual property and other assets of Indix Corporation, an artificial intelligence company providing comprehensive product descriptions for more than one billion products sold and shipped worldwide. Except where specifically indicated below, this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include the results of Compli or Indix.
 We generated revenue of $272.1 million, $213.2 million, and $167.4 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. We had net losses of $75.6 million, $64.1 million, and $57.9 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, primarily due to our investments in growth. We operate our business as one operating segment.

Industry and Competition 
 Transaction taxes are ubiquitous and complex, and compliance is increasingly difficult for businesses of all sizes. Businesses, regardless of size, industry, or location, are subject to transaction tax compliance requirements. These requirements are burdensome even for a business transacting only in a single location and become exponentially more complex for companies doing business in multiple taxing jurisdictions and offering numerous products and services that are each taxed in different ways. 
 The responsibility for accurately determining and collecting sales tax generally falls on the seller, which must go through a series of steps to determine the tax due for each transaction. These steps involve complexities that are often prone to error and difficult to manage when conducted manually. Varying dynamics in local, regional, state, and national legislative processes in the United States and internationally have resulted in a patchwork of transaction tax rules that are not intuitive, often confusing, and inconsistent across jurisdictions. Further complications arise from the thousands of changes enacted every year as taxing authorities amend their tax rates and taxability rules, modify taxing jurisdictions, and implement other regulatory changes. 
 Due to the importance of tax revenue, taxing authorities conduct transaction tax audits to verify accurate and timely collection and payment. These audits can be time consuming and distracting to a business, and can cost hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of dollars, including internal and external audit management costs, as well as payment of uncollected taxes, penalties, and interest. 
 Commerce across multiple jurisdictions increases the burden of transaction tax compliance. Conducting commerce across multiple jurisdictions involves a complex set of location-by-location, region-by-region, state-by-state, country-by-country, and product-by-product application of tax laws. Ecommerce, globalization, and omnichannel retailing have facilitated cross-jurisdiction transactions for businesses of all sizes, increasing their transaction tax compliance burden and risk, and the need for an automated compliance solution. 
 Many businesses currently attempt to handle transaction tax compliance processes manually, risking miscalculations and incorrect collections, which can result in customer dissatisfaction and/or financial penalties. Some businesses supplement their internal manual efforts with costly outsourced professional service firms to perform tax compliance functions. Many businesses conduct transactions using business applications such as accounting, ERP, ecommerce, POS, recurring billing, and CRM systems. These systems sometimes include rudimentary tax calculation capabilities, but they are usually not sufficiently robust or current to provide accurate tax determinations. Businesses may also rely on tax-specific software products from providers other than Avalara, but these often offer limited pre-built integrations with critical business applications, can require ongoing updates, are deployed on-premises, or have a high cost of ownership. 
 The industry that provides support for transaction tax compliance is highly competitive and fragmented. Businesses employ a mix of approaches to address transaction tax compliance, including: 
  
• | people-intensive, do-it-yourself approaches that rely on transaction-specific research, manual determination, static tax tables, spreadsheet software, or rate calculator services, as well as manual filing and remittance activities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | outsourced transaction tax compliance services offered by accounting and specialized consulting firms; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | tax-specific solutions from other vendors, including CCH Incorporated (a subsidiary of Wolters Kluwer NV), ONESOURCE Indirect Tax (a division of Thomson Reuters), Sovos, and Vertex, Inc.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe customers consider the following factors when selecting a transaction tax compliance solution: 
  
• | ability to improve overall transaction tax compliance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to deliver real time tax determinations;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | ease of deployment and use;
--+----------------------------

 4


 
• | ease of integration with the customer’s business applications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to address multiple transaction tax compliance functions, from initial taxability and tax rate determination through remittance of funds;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | total cost of ownership; and
--+-----------------------------


• | tax content applicable to the customer’s business.
--+---------------------------------------------------

 We believe our cloud-based solutions compare favorably across these factors, but different customers will weigh each of these factors in different ways, and we may not be competitive for some customers, depending on specific customer needs. For example, our longer established competitors may have better name recognition or more established relationships. Some customers may have less complex tax determination and compliance needs or require transaction tax types for which we do not currently have extensive content. We are aware of these competitive factors, and we will continue to consider and develop functionalities, service offerings, pricing structures, and additional content to further strengthen our competitive position. 
 Avalara Compliance Cloud
 The Avalara Compliance Cloud enables customers to address the complexity of transaction tax compliance, process transactions in real time, produce detailed records of transaction tax determinations, and reduce errors, audit exposure, and total transaction tax compliance costs. Key strengths of our Avalara Compliance Cloud include: 

• | Comprehensive compliance with a broad array of transaction tax obligations. Our platform powers a suite of compliance solutions for a wide and growing range of transaction taxes, such as sales and use tax, VAT, fuel excise tax, lodging tax, and communications tax. Our platform handles transaction tax determination; tax return preparation, filing, and remittance; tax records maintenance; and exemption certificate and other compliance document storage and management. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Real time tax determination. As transactions are executed in our customers’ business applications, the Avalara Compliance Cloud performs a series of functions to deliver tax determinations in real time. Our engine validates physical transaction addresses, uses geolocation technology to determine applicable tax jurisdictions, checks taxability against our extensive tax rules and regulations database, identifies applicable tax rates, and identifies applicable tax exemptions and holidays to determine the applicable transaction tax. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Easy to implement. Our cloud-based solutions are designed to be easy to implement and deploy and can often be configured and operational in a matter of hours. To ease implementation, we have invested in developing and maintaining more than 700 pre-built integrations that are designed to connect our solutions to a broad range of leading business applications, including accounting, ERP, ecommerce, POS, recurring billing, and CRM systems. Our integrations enable rapid deployment and are designed to seamlessly embed into our customers’ business applications, reducing the need for costly custom implementations. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Easy to use. Our cloud-based solutions minimize day-to-day operating and maintenance tasks for our customers because tax determinations occur in real time within their business applications. Furthermore, our cloud architecture ensures that our tax content updates are immediately and automatically applied to our customers’ transactions. Our solutions are managed via a powerful and intuitive web-based console that simplifies configuration and unifies administration, reporting, and returns processing across a customer’s multiple business applications. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lower total cost of ownership. Compared to on-premises products, our comprehensive, integrated suite of automated, cloud-based compliance solutions require substantially less upfront deployment effort, hardware purchases, and ongoing maintenance and support costs. Our solutions reduce our customers’ need for manual research and the related higher personnel costs, and eliminate the need for a patchwork of disparate products and services for separate transaction tax compliance functions.

Products and Solutions 
 We offer a comprehensive suite of solutions for transaction tax compliance. These solutions can be purchased individually or as an integrated transaction tax compliance solution. 
  
• | AvaTax for Tax Determination. We entered the tax compliance industry in 2004 with AvaTax, a unique and disruptive solution for determining sales tax in the United States. Since then, we have added determination for multiple additional tax types to effectively address additional industries and geographies, and we can now determine sales and use tax, VAT, fuel excise tax, lodging tax, and communications tax. With the addition of the VAT determination capability, we can manage our customers’ transaction tax determination needs both in the United States and internationally. To further accommodate our customers’ international needs, this solution also includes an add-on option for tariff and duty rate determinations for cross-border transactions. AvaTax is generally sold on an annual subscription basis. The AvaTax determination solutions can integrate with the Avalara Returns and Compliance Document Management solutions discussed below for a seamless end-to-end transaction tax compliance solution. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Avalara Returns for Tax Return Preparation, Filing, and Remittance. In addition to correctly determining the amount of tax, businesses face the burden of filing jurisdiction-specific tax return forms that detail the transactions, and remitting collected taxes on a timely basis to the appropriate taxing authorities. Our returns solutions are either integrated and embedded inside AvaTax, offered on a standalone managed basis, or accessed online via a self-serve web tool. Avalara Returns is generally sold on an annual subscription basis. Customers can also purchase Avalara Returns on a per filing basis. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Integrated Solutions.    We offer our tax return preparation, filing, and remittance solutions as an add-on to AvaTax. These combined solutions automate and streamline the process of transaction tax return preparation, filing, and remittance. These solutions are fully integrated with AvaTax determination and leverage stored transaction data to populate tax return forms that we provide to the customer to file or that we file on their behalf. For some of our returns types, we also offer to execute the remittance of tax collections to the taxing authorities. 
 Standalone Managed Solutions.    We also offer our returns preparation, filing, and remittance solutions on a standalone basis for customers who use other tax decision processes but entrust the return preparation, filing, and remittance process to us. We work with customers to ensure that determination data is properly formatted and entered into our returns engine, which then populates the appropriate tax return forms. As with our integrated solution, the tax return forms are either provided to the customer to file or can be filed by us on their behalf. Although we provide this solution to numerous U.S. customers, it is one of the primary offerings in our European VAT business. While the VAT regime in Europe reduces the complexity of tax determination, businesses in Europe continue to face significant challenges in registering to collect VAT, preparing returns, filing returns, and remitting payments because each country has its own specific rules and regulations governing these processes. Our European returns preparation and filing solution helps customers manage these challenges in an efficient and cost-effective manner. 
 Self-Serve Solutions.    We offer two self-serve solutions for customers who have less complex filing requirements. TrustFile is a standalone self-serve web solution that customers use to populate sales and use tax return forms. Customers upload their tax collection data via a web interface, which our solution then formats for the appropriate tax returns. We then can either provide the customer with a signature-ready return form or automatically complete the entire submission and payment process for them. Our MyLodgeTax solution prepares and files returns on a self-serve basis for our lodging tax customers. MyLodgeTax is a web-based solution into which customers upload transaction data, and that data is then formatted onto the appropriate tax return forms for filing.

• | Avalara Compliance Document Management. Businesses of all sizes face myriad requirements for the collection, storage, and management of numerous official forms, including tax exemption certificates, W-8 forms, W-9 forms, and licenses and registrations. We provide compliance document management solutions that are either integrated into AvaTax or that function as a standalone solution. Our most significant compliance document solution offering is CertCapture, which creates, validates, stores, and manages sales tax exemption and reseller certificates. This solution makes tax documents available for easy retrieval and helps our customers validate them and keep them up to date. Sellers collect tax exemption certificates (both paper and electronic) to demonstrate that purchasers are exempt from sales tax. Our solution helps our customers limit audit exposure by establishing an audit trail for tax exempt transactions.

• | Professional Services. A small percentage of our revenue is derived from a broad range of specialized tax compliance services that we deliver on a standalone basis or in conjunction with the sale or implementation of our automated determination, returns, or document management solutions. These services include such projects as nexus studies and analysis, voluntary compliance initiatives, complex tax registrations, and specialized tax research.

 Competitive Strengths 
 Our key competitive strengths include: 
 Powerful technology.    Our proprietary platform powers a comprehensive and integrated set of transaction tax compliance solutions that enable our customers to automate and accurately manage their transaction tax compliance processes. Our platform combines an extensive proprietary database containing tax jurisdiction boundaries, tax rates, product- and date-specific taxability rules, and return preparation and filing requirements, with advanced algorithms for precise real time address validation via geolocation technology, application of taxability rules, tax determination, tax return preparation and filing, tax remittance, and tax forms and records management. Our platform processes billions of tax determinations per year, with the speed, reliability, and security capabilities designed to serve the needs of even the largest of enterprise customers.

Extensive integrations.    We have invested in developing and maintaining more than 700 pre-built integrations that are designed to embed our solutions seamlessly into leading business applications, including accounting, ERP, ecommerce, POS, recurring billing, and CRM systems. We believe that maintaining pre-built integrations with a broad range of business applications provides a competitive advantage, to which we refer as a moat, as these integrations dramatically reduce implementation time, effort, and cost; enable our solutions to function seamlessly with the core applications our customers use to process and manage their transactions; and allow customers to easily and efficiently manage tax compliance across multiple business applications. We offer far more pre-built integrations with these applications than other tax software providers and we plan to continue adding more. We have pre-built integrations with leading business application providers such as Magento, QuickBooks, Microsoft, NetSuite, Sage, 3dcart, Salesforce Commerce Cloud, and Epicor, that customers can use to connect our solutions with their applications. In addition, we have relationships with some application providers, including BigCommerce, Shopify, and others, that include our pre-built integrations in their platforms, allowing customers to easily choose our solutions to automate transaction tax determinations. 
 Extensive content.    We have amassed, expanded, and integrated an extensive database of statutory tax content, including product classifications and taxability rules, exemption conditions, tax holidays, jurisdiction boundaries, tax rates, thresholds, registration, and return preparation and filing requirements, as well as millions of UPCs, linked to taxability rules. We employ a large group of tax research analysts who continually update this library, which is processed by our determination engine and delivered to our customers via our cloud connection. In addition to internal development, we have acquired multiple transaction tax related businesses and acquired or licensed databases containing deep stores of knowledge to augment the tax content that supports the Avalara Compliance Cloud. We also have built and maintain a library of thousands of local, regional, state, and national tax return forms, tax exemption certificate forms, VAT invoice templates, and other compliance documents. Our extensive tax content and forms databases have enabled us to serve the compliance needs of an ever-expanding list of businesses in different geographies and industries such as fuels, communications, and lodging. 
 Comprehensive, easy-to-use, scalable solutions.    We provide solutions to a full range of transaction tax compliance burdens. Our solutions can be configured and managed using our intuitive administrative consoles, which we regard as a significant differentiator from other transaction tax services because they facilitate fast and easy company-specific configuration, detailed transaction analysis, and access to detailed reports, worksheets, calendars, and other management functions. The consoles also provide a single point of management for various compliance solutions, scale as a customer’s needs grow or change, and automatically aggregate transactions from multiple business applications. We believe our comprehensive solutions enable us to provide added value to our customers, increase their loyalty and satisfaction, and raise their potential long-term value to us. 
 Broad ecosystem.    We have strategically built a broad range of relationships with our network of business application publishers and their reseller channels, integration developers, implementation specialists, and accounting and financial advisors. These relationships provide us with an effective distribution channel, the majority of our pre-built integrations, a source of referral business, occasions for cross-selling, new opportunities for compliance automation, and early access to developing technologies. 
 As a result of our competitive strengths, our platform becomes deeply embedded in our customers’ business processes and systems, providing them with an automated solution central to their ability to transact. Our strategic position drives long-term customer relationships, as evidenced by our net revenue retention rate, which was 107% on average for the four quarters ended December 31, 2018. 
 Growth Strategies 
 We plan to continue investing to provide our customers with best-in-class solutions and to expand our market opportunity. Our primary growth strategies include: 
  
• | Broaden our base of customers. We believe that the market for comprehensive, automated transaction tax compliance solutions is large and underserved, and therefore we can significantly increase our customer base. In addition, as businesses expand their product and jurisdictional footprints, we believe the need for cost-effective transaction tax compliance solutions increases. We will continue to invest in our sales and marketing efforts, both domestically and internationally, and intend to expand into new markets to grow our customer base. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Grow revenue from our existing customers. Many of our customers begin with a single solution, such as our AvaTax determination solution. This initial entry point establishes Avalara as a trusted part of a customer’s financial system, and as a customer’s sales increase and the number of transactions processed grows, our volume-based subscription model generates more revenue. The initial entry point also provides us with significant cross-sell opportunities, including tax return preparation and filing, tax remittance, and tax exemption certificate and other compliance documents management. These solutions work together to provide customers with a comprehensive automated solution for all of their transaction tax compliance needs. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our partner ecosystem. We have an extensive network of business application providers and other customer referral sources that provides us with qualified leads and new customer opportunities. In some cases, providers purchase functionality from us for use by their customers. We intend to continue to expand our partner ecosystem by actively seeking new relationships that offer exposure to potential customers and integrations with more business applications. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand international reach. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to expand our suite of solutions for use outside of the United States. Of our 13 worldwide offices, five are located outside the United States and we support transaction tax compliance in Europe, South America, and Asia. We plan to continue investing in these geographies, while also expanding our solutions and growing our sales force to expand into new regions. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broaden our content and suite of solutions. We devote substantial resources to continuously improve the Avalara Compliance Cloud, add innovative new features and functionalities, add content, build technology to support new content types, and improve the user experience for our solutions. We intend to continue to make significant investments to acquire accurate, relevant content and expertise to best serve the transaction tax compliance needs of our customers. For example, we acquired fuel and alcohol excise tax, lodging tax, communications tax, portions of European VAT, and Brazilian tax solutions. These acquisitions accelerate the expansion of our tax content, solutions, customer base, cross-selling opportunities, and geographic reach. We intend to continue pursuing opportunities to acquire businesses and technologies that accomplish our strategic objectives.

Customers
 Our customers include businesses across industries and of all sizes, ranging from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies. 
 The mid-market has been and remains our primary target market segment for marketing and selling our solutions. We use core customers as a metric to focus our customer count reporting on our primary target market segment. As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had approximately 9,070, 7,490, and 6,250 core customers, respectively, representing less than half of our total number of customers. In 2018, our core customers represented more than 85% of our total revenue. 
 We define a core customer as: 
  
• | a unique account identifier in our billing system (multiple companies or divisions within a single consolidated enterprise that each have a separate unique account identifier are each treated as separate customers);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that is active as of the measurement date; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | for which we have recognized, as of the measurement date, greater than $3,000 in total revenue during the last twelve months.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Currently, our core customer count includes only customers with unique account identifiers in our primary U.S. billing systems and does not include customers who subscribe to our solutions through our international subsidiaries or certain legacy billing systems, primarily related to past acquisitions. As we increase our international operations and sales in future periods, we may add customers billed from our international subsidiaries to the core customer metric.

We also have a substantial number of customers of various sizes who do not meet the revenue threshold to be considered a core customer. Many of these customers are in the small business and self-serve segment of the marketplace, which represents strategic value and a growth opportunity for us. Customers who do not meet the revenue threshold to be considered a core customer provide us with market share and awareness, and we anticipate that some may grow into core customers. 
 No single customer, including considering on an aggregate basis those customers that we know are under common control or are affiliates, represented more than 10% of our total revenue in 2018, 2017, or 2016. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We sell our solutions primarily on a subscription basis. Most of our customers purchase pre-built or custom integrations into their business applications and choose from various subscription plans that are priced according to the volume of transactions, tax returns, or tax documents they require. Our solutions are capable of addressing the transaction tax compliance needs of businesses of all sizes, from the smallest sole proprietors to Fortune 100 enterprises. While the mid-market has been and remains our primary target market segment for marketing and selling our solutions, we also maintain distinct teams and processes for pursuing enterprise and small businesses. 
 While we generally identify and engage directly with our customer prospects, we leverage the sales and referral resources of a broad ecosystem of partners across all market segments. These partners include our network of business application publishers, integration developers, technology developers and implementation specialists, and value-added resellers. This network provides us with pre-sold customers as well as qualified leads through a variety of incentive programs. In some cases, providers purchase functionality from us for use by their customers. Additionally, we actively conduct programs to engage with state regulators, tax and accounting firms, payroll vendors, and financial services providers. 
 The majority of our mid-market sales are conducted via telephone, requiring few to no in-person interactions with customer prospects. We target prospects via an array of marketing automation strategies and tactics, including paid and unpaid digital advertising, content marketing, prospect database nurturing, and other automated outbound marketing activities. 
 We also maintain a specialized sales force that sells into the enterprise market predominantly via telephone, but in some cases through in-person sales. These prospects have historically been concentrated in our fuel excise and compliance document management businesses, but we believe we have a significant and growing opportunity to sell our sales tax, use tax, and VAT determination and returns solutions into this market. 
 In addition to reaching highly targeted enterprise and mid-market prospects, our marketing investments and activities generate interest from large numbers of small businesses that also are burdened by transaction tax compliance requirements. Small business customers can purchase and configure smaller plans at lower price points through our self-service online marketplace without the involvement of our primary selling or customer onboarding teams. Additionally, we have established relationships with certain business application providers that target small businesses that have purchased our functionality for use by their customers and embedded our solutions into their offering. We believe serving small businesses is important because it establishes a customer relationship that may become more valuable to us over time as the customer grows or more fully embraces an automated compliance solution and provides a potential barrier to entry from competitors that may seek to build market share by targeting the small business segment. 
 Partners 
 Expanding and maintaining our partner ecosystem has been an essential part of our growth. Enabling easy, quick, and low-cost integration into customers’ business applications, gathering high-quality new customer leads, and participating with professional service providers to help manage transaction tax compliance are all important to our continued success, and we work hard to maintain and grow an ecosystem that we believe is unmatched in the industry.

Our partner ecosystem consists of different types of partners that provide us access to their customers and clients: 
 Integration Partners.    Our integration partners build integrations for business applications, including accounting, ERP, ecommerce, POS, recurring billing, and CRM systems. These integrations are designed to link the Avalara Compliance Cloud to business applications and share data relevant to transaction tax determination and compliance. Some of our integration partners are the actual publishers of the business applications, who work with us to provide transaction tax functionality to their customers through those business applications. Other integration partners are independent software developers or resellers who we engage to build and maintain the integrations. In either case, the integration partners are paid a commission based on a percentage of the sales of our solutions that use the integration. In general, integration partners are paid a higher commission for the initial sale to a new customer and lower recurring commissions for renewal subscription terms. We currently have over 700 pre-built integrations. 
 Referral Partners.    Our referral partners refer new customers to us, and receive a commission based on a percentage of the first-year sales of our solutions to those new customers. Many referral partners are software resellers or other participants in the marketplace who have access to high quality new customer leads. Many of our integration partners also refer customers who have purchased the partner’s business application and who need additional assistance with transaction taxes. Some professional service partners, as discussed below, can be an additional source of new customer referrals. 
 Avalara Included Partners.    Some of the publishers who build integrations to connect our solutions to their business applications also purchase our solutions from us to distribute to their customers, either as part of their offering or as an add-on to their application. For example, certain ecommerce platform providers purchase an AvaTax subscription so that they can include sales tax determination as part of their offering to their retailer customers. We refer to these partners as Avalara Included Partners, and they provide our solutions to their customers either on a white label basis or as “powered by Avalara.” In either case, most Avalara Included Partners are also referral partners who refer their customers to us to purchase additional solutions, such as our returns solutions or CertCapture. 
 Professional Service Partners.    We also have partners who are professional service providers who work directly with the customers for transaction tax related services. These partners may implement and/or configure our solutions for customers, either alone or as part of a larger enterprise software implementation. Other professional service partners are accountants or other advisors who assist customers with transaction tax issues. Payments to these partners vary, depending on the specific relationship, with some partners billing customers directly, some subcontracting with us, and some participating in the referral program. 
Research & Development and Tax Content Team 
 Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, and testing of the Avalara Compliance Cloud. We devote substantial resources to continuously improve our platform, add innovative new features and functionalities, build technology to support new content types, and improve the user experience for our platform and solutions. 
 Our content team works to improve and support our solutions by adding new tax content and maintaining existing content on our platform. This large team continually monitors, tests, and updates our tax content to incorporate new tax rates, rules, taxing jurisdiction boundaries, and exemption conditions.
 Intellectual Property 
 We primarily rely upon a combination of confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and intellectual property. Our trademarks and service marks include Avalara, the Avalara logo, AvaTax, the Avalara Compliance Cloud, “Tax compliance done right,” marks for our acquired businesses, and various marketing slogans. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our solutions or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary, and may also attempt to develop similar technology independently. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate.

The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks, and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Third parties may claim that our current or future solutions infringe their intellectual property rights. We may have to defend ourselves against claims of intellectual property infringement, which could be expensive for us and harm our business and financial condition. 
 Government Regulation 
 Our business is subject to a range of complex laws and regulations, mostly relating to our involvement in our customers’ financial transactions. To be successful, we must promote and monitor compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements. 
 We perform critical business functions for our customers, including tax determination, returns preparation and filing, and tax remittance. The federal Bank Secrecy Act requires that financial institutions, of which money transmitters are a subset, register with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to monitor, identify, report and, where possible, avoid money laundering and criminal or terrorist financing by customers. Most U.S. states also have laws that apply to money transmitters, and impose various licensure, examination, and bonding requirements on them. We believe these federal and state laws and regulations were not intended to cover the business activity of remitting transaction taxes that taxpayers owe to the various states. However, if federal or state regulators were to apply these laws and regulations to this business activity, whether through expansion of enforcement activities, new interpretations of the scope of certain of these laws and regulations or of available exemptions, or otherwise, or if our activities were held by a court to be covered by such laws or regulations, we could be required to expend time, money, and other resources to deal with enforcement actions and any penalties that might be asserted, to institute and maintain a compliance program specific to money transmission laws, and possibly to change aspects of how we conduct business to achieve compliance or minimize regulation. We have contractually agreed with certain states collecting sales tax that in determining and remitting taxes on behalf of certain customers, we will comply with various technical, filing, privacy, confidentiality, bonding, and trust account requirements. 
 In the course of selling products and services, retailers and other businesses often come into possession of credit card numbers and other personal information of consumers. Determining the transaction taxes owed by our customers involves providing our platform with the types and prices of products they sell, as well as information regarding addresses that products are shipped from and delivered to. Our tax exemption certificate management solution also requires input of certain information regarding the purchasers who are entitled to tax exemptions. Numerous local, regional, state, and national laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, and safeguarding of certain information that could be used to commit identity theft or fraud. Although most of the data that is provided to our solutions by our customers cannot be used to identify individual consumers, we may be subject to these laws in certain circumstances. Most states have also adopted data security breach laws that require notice to affected consumers of any security breach as to their personal information. In the event of a security breach, our compliance with these laws may subject us, depending on the personal information in question, to costs associated with notice and remediation, as well as potential investigations from federal regulatory agencies and state attorneys general. Failures to safeguard data adequately or to destroy data securely could subject us to regulatory investigations or enforcement actions under federal or state data security, unfair practices, or consumer protection laws. The scope and interpretation of these laws, and the burdens and costs of complying with them, could increase in the future. 
 Employees and Culture 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,592 full-time employees. Of these employees, 1,109 are based in the United States, 5 are based in Canada, 116 are in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, 250 are based in India, and 112 are based in Brazil. With the exception of Brazil, where collective bargaining agreements are commonplace, none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good and we have not experienced any work stoppages.

We believe our corporate culture provides an advantage in recruiting new employees and retaining our best talent, as well as driving behaviors across our entire organization that help us succeed in the marketplace. This culture is characterized in the many employees who embody our nine success traits: Optimism, Passion, Adaptability, Humility, Fun, Ownership, Curiosity, Urgency, and Simplicity. The rallying point of our culture is the color orange. Our employees wear this color with pride every day in all of our locations and we have trademarked the slogan “The Power of Orange.” Our culture permeates our sales and marketing outreach and the significance of the color orange has been featured in multiple news articles. As a result, we believe our customers, partners, and many prospects readily identify and appreciate our culture in their interactions with the Avalara team.
