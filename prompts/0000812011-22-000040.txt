ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Vail Resorts, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is referred to throughout this document as “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company.”
Vail Resorts, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was organized as a holding company in 1997 and operates through various subsidiaries. Our operations are grouped into three business segments: Mountain, Lodging and Real Estate, which represented approximately 88%, 12% and 0%, respectively, of our net revenue for our fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 (“Fiscal 2022”). 
Our Mountain segment operates 41 world-class destination mountain resorts and regional ski areas (collectively, our “Resorts”). Additionally, the Mountain segment includes ancillary services, primarily including ski school, dining and retail/rental operations.
In the Lodging segment, we own and/or manage a collection of luxury hotels and condominiums under our RockResorts brand; other strategic lodging properties and a large number of condominiums located in proximity to our North American mountain resorts; National Park Service (“NPS”) concessioner properties including the Grand Teton Lodge Company (“GTLC”), which operates destination resorts in Grand Teton National Park; a Colorado resort ground transportation company and mountain resort golf courses.
We refer to “Resort” as the combination of the Mountain and Lodging segments. Our Real Estate segment owns, develops and sells real estate in and around our resort communities.
For financial information and other information about the Company’s segments and geographic areas, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 
Acquisition of Andermatt-Sedrun Sport AG
On August 3, 2022, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, we acquired a 55% controlling interest in Andermatt-Sedrun Sport AG (“Andermatt-Sedrun”) from Andermatt Swiss Alps AG ("ASA"). Andermatt-Sedrun operates mountain and ski-related assets, including all lifts, most of the restaurants and a ski school operation at the ski area. We invested CHF 149.3 million ($155.7 million), comprised of a CHF 110.0 million ($114.4 million) investment into Andermatt-Sedrun for use in capital investments to enhance the guest experience on the mountain and CHF 39.3 million ($41.3 million) paid to ASA. The proceeds paid to ASA will be fully reinvested into the real estate developments in the base area. ASA has retained a 40% ownership stake, with a group of existing shareholders comprising the remaining 5% ownership.
COVID-19 Impact
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions in international and U.S. economies and markets, and has had an unprecedented impact on the travel and leisure industries, including our Company. While our North American Resorts were operational throughout the 2021/2022 ski season, the impacts of COVID-19, and specifically the Omicron variant, resulted in negative impacts to our operational results, including staffing challenges, increased labor costs and reduced visitation through the holiday period of the 2021/2022 North American ski season. In particular, Whistler Blackcomb was disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 related travel restrictions during the holiday period, which continued to result in lower than normal U.S. destination and international visitation to the resort. However, our results for the 2021/2022 North American ski season significantly improved following the holiday period, and have significantly outperformed results from the prior year, primarily due to the greater impact of COVID-19 and related limitations and restrictions on results for the prior year. Despite these improved results, COVID-19 still presents significant challenges, including challenges to our ability to maintain adequate staffing in a constrained labor market. 
Mountain Segment
In the Mountain segment, the Company operates the following 41 destination mountain resorts and regional ski areas, including five resorts within the top ten most visited resorts in the United States for the 2021/2022 North American ski season:
*Denotes a destination mountain resort, which generally receives a meaningful portion of skier visits from long-distance travelers, as opposed to our regional ski areas, which tend to generate skier visits predominantly from their respective local markets. 
Our Mountain segment derives revenue through the sale of lift tickets, including pass products, as well as a comprehensive offering of amenities available to guests, including ski and snowboard lessons, equipment rentals and retail merchandise sales, a variety of dining venues, private club operations and other winter and summer recreational activities. In addition to providing extensive guest amenities, we also lease some of our owned and leased commercial space to third party operators to add unique restaurants and retail stores to the mix of amenities at the base of our resorts.
Many of our destination mountain resorts are year-round mountain resorts that provide a comprehensive resort experience to a diverse clientele with an attractive demographic profile. We offer a broad complement of winter and summer recreational activities, including skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, snowtubing, sightseeing, mountain biking, guided hiking, zip lines, challenge ropes courses, alpine slides, mountain coasters, children’s activities and other recreational activities. Collectively, our Resorts are located in close proximity to population centers totaling over 110 million people.

Regional Ski Areas
Our ski resort network allows us to connect guests with drive-to access and destination resort access on a single pass product. Building a presence near major metropolitan areas with large populations enables us to drive advance commitment pass product sales among a broad array of guests. 
Northeast
We own and operate eight regional ski areas in the Northeast that we believe provide a compelling regional and local connection to guests within driving distance from the New York, Boston and the greater New England markets. Stowe is the premier, high-end regional ski area in the Northeast offering outstanding skiing and an exceptional base area experience. Okemo and Mount Snow are compelling regional destinations serving guests in the New York metropolitan area and throughout New England. Hunter Mountain is a day-trip ski area primarily serving the New York metropolitan area. Additionally, we own four ski areas in New Hampshire serving guests throughout New England.
Mid-Atlantic (Pennsylvania)
We own and operate eight ski areas in the Mid-Atlantic region serving guests in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Southern New Jersey, Baltimore and Washington D.C. Our presence in the region allows us to offer compelling local options and easy overnight weekend and holiday trips to our premium Northeast regional ski areas, which are within driving distance from these markets. 
Midwest
We own and operate ten ski areas in the Midwest that draw guests from Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Columbus, Kansas City and Louisville. Located within close proximity to major metropolitan markets, these ski areas provide beginners with easy access to beginner ski programs and offer night skiing for young adults and families. Additionally, the proximity of these ski areas allows for regular usage by avid skiers.

Australia
Australia is an important market for both domestic skiing during the Australian winter and as a source of international visitation to the Northern Hemisphere in the Australian off-season, with typically over one million estimated Australian skier visits annually to North America, Europe and Japan. We own three of the five largest ski areas in Australia, which we serve with the Epic Australia Pass, an Australian dollar denominated pass product marketed specifically to Australian guests. Perisher, located in New South Wales, is the largest ski resort in Australia and targets guests in the Sydney metropolitan area and the broader New South Wales market, while Falls Creek and Mount Hotham are two of the largest ski areas in Victoria and target guests in the Melbourne metropolitan area and the broader Victoria market. 
Ski Industry/Competition
There are approximately 755 ski areas in North America with approximately 470 in the U.S., ranging from small ski area operations that service day skiers to large resorts that attract both day skiers and destination resort guests looking for a comprehensive vacation experience. During the 2021/2022 North American ski season, combined skier visits for all ski areas in North America were approximately 80.6 million. Our North American Resorts had approximately 16.2 million skier visits during the 2021/2022 ski season, representing approximately 20.1% of North American skier visits.
There is limited opportunity for development of new destination ski resorts due to the limited private lands on which ski areas can be built, the difficulty in obtaining the appropriate governmental approvals to build on public lands and the significant capital needed to construct the necessary infrastructure. As such, there have been virtually no new destination ski resorts in North America for over 40 years, which has allowed and should continue to allow the best-positioned destination resorts to benefit from future industry growth. Our resorts compete with other major destination mountain resorts, including, among others, Aspen Snowmass, Copper Mountain, Mammoth, Deer Valley, Snowbird, Palisades Tahoe, Killington, Sierra at Tahoe, Steamboat, Jackson Hole and Winter Park, as well as other ski areas in Colorado, California, Nevada, Utah, the Pacific Northwest, the Northeast, the Southwest, British Columbia, Canada and Switzerland, and other destination ski areas worldwide as well as non-ski related vacation options and destinations. Additionally, our pass products compete with other multi-resort frequency and pass products in North America, including the IKON Pass, the Mountain Collective Pass and various regional and local pass products.
The ski industry statistics stated in this section have been derived primarily from data published by Colorado Ski Country USA, Canadian Ski Council, Kottke National End of Season Surveys as well as other industry publications.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe our premier resorts and business model differentiate our Company from the rest of the ski industry. We own and operate some of the most iconic, branded destination mountain resorts in geographically diverse and important ski destinations in Colorado, Utah, Lake Tahoe and the Pacific Northwest, including British Columbia, Canada. These resorts are complemented by regional ski areas in the Northeast, Pacific Northwest, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, which are strategically positioned near key U.S. population centers, as well as three ski areas in Australia and one ski resort in Switzerland. Through our data-driven marketing analytics and personalized marketing capabilities, we target increased penetration of ski pass products, providing our guests with a strong value proposition in return for guests committing to ski at our resorts prior to, or very early into the ski season, which we believe attracts more guests to our resorts. We believe we invest in more capital improvements than our competitors and we create synergies by operating multiple resorts, which enhances our profitability by enabling customers to access our network of resorts with our pass products. Many of our destination mountain resorts located in the U.S. typically rank in the most visited ski resorts in the U.S. (five of the top ten for the 2021/2022 U.S. ski season), and most of our destination mountain resorts consistently rank in the top ranked ski resorts in North America according to industry surveys, which we attribute to our ability to provide a high-quality experience.
We believe the following factors contribute directly to each Resort’s success:
Exceptional Mountain Experience
•World-Class Mountain Resorts and Integrated Base Resort Areas
Our mountain resorts offer a multitude of skiing and snowboarding experiences for the beginner, intermediate, advanced and expert levels. Each mountain resort is fully integrated into expansive resort base areas offering a broad array of lodging, dining, retail, nightlife and other amenities, some of which we own or manage, to our guests.
•Snow Conditions
Our Resorts in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado and Utah, the Sierra Nevada Mountains in Lake Tahoe and the Coast Mountains in British Columbia, Canada receive average annual snowfall between 18 and 35 feet. Even in these areas which receive abundant snowfall, we have invested in significant snowmaking systems that help provide a more consistent experience, especially in the early season. We have made significant recent investments in our snowmaking systems in Colorado that transformed the early-season terrain experience at Vail, Keystone and Beaver Creek. Our other ski areas receive less snowfall than our western North American mountain resorts, but we have invested in snowmaking operations at these resorts in order to provide a consistent experience for our guests. Additionally, we provide several hundred acres of groomed terrain at each of our mountain resorts with extensive fleets of snow grooming equipment.
•Lift Service 
We systematically upgrade our lifts and put in new lifts to increase uphill capacity and streamline skier traffic to maximize the guest experience. Discretionary expenditures expected for calendar year 2022 include, among other projects, the installation of 18 new or replacement lifts across 12 of our resorts. Key lift upgrades include, among others:
•a new high-speed 10-person gondola at Whistler Blackcomb replacing the existing 6-person gondola;
•replacing Whistler Blackcomb’s existing Big Red Express high-speed 4-person lift with a high-speed 6-person chair;
•a new high-speed 4-person chair in Vail’s Sun Down Bowl;
•replacing the current 4-person chair in Vail’s Game Creek Bowl with a new high-speed 6-person lift;
•replacing Breckenridge’s current fixed-grip double Rip’s Ride lift with a high-speed 4-person chair;
•a new high-speed 6-person chair replacing Northstar’s Comstock 4-person chair; and
•replacing Heavenly’s existing fixed-grip triple North Bowl lift with a high-speed 4-person chair.
In the past several years, we have installed or upgraded several high speed chairlifts and gondolas across our mountain resorts, including: 
•the 250-acre lift-served terrain expansion in the McCoy Park area of Beaver Creek; 
•a new four-person high speed lift to serve Peak 7 at Breckenridge; 
•replacing the four-person Peru lift at Keystone with a six-person high speed chairlift; 
•replacing the Peachtree lift at Crested Butte with a new three-person fixed-grip lift; and 
•an upgrade of the four-person Quantum lift at Okemo with a six-person high speed chairlift, relocating the existing four-person Quantum lift to replace the Green Ridge three-person fixed-grip chairlift.
•upgrading the Daisy and Brooks fixed-grip lifts at Stevens Pass to four-person high-speed lifts; 
•upgrading the Teocalli fixed-grip lift at Crested Butte to a four-person high-speed lift; 
•installing a new four-person lift at Park City, Over and Out; and
•replacing the Leichardt T-bar lift at Perisher with a new four-person lift.
•Terrain Parks
We are committed to leading the industry in terrain park design, education and events for the growing segment of freestyle skiers and snowboarders. Each of our destination mountain resorts has multiple terrain parks that include progressively-challenging features. These park structures, coupled with freestyle ski school programs, promote systematic learning from basic to professional skills.
Extraordinary Service and Amenities
•Commitment to the Guest Experience
Our focus is to provide quality service at every touch point of the guest journey. Prior to arrival at our mountain resorts, guests can receive personal assistance through our full-service, central reservations group and through our comprehensive websites to book desired lodging accommodations, lift tickets and pass products, ski school lessons, equipment rentals, activities and other resort services. Upon arrival, our resort staff serve as ambassadors to engage guests, answer questions and create a customer-focused environment. We offer EpicMix, a mobile application that, through radio frequency technology or Global Positioning System, captures a guest’s activity on the mountain (e.g. number of ski days, vertical feet skied and chairlift activity); provides current trail maps along with real-time trail and lift status; allows guests to access real and forecasted lift line wait times; and provides information regarding parking, dining, events and other on-mountain activities. We have also invested in lift ticket express fulfillment through mobile technology by allowing lift ticket purchasers that buy online to bypass the ticket window. Additionally, we are focused on improving the guest ski/snowboard rental experience by eliminating the need for a guest to wait in several lines with the application of a “pod” concept in several of our high-volume locations. 
We also solicit guest feedback through a variety of surveys and results, which are used to ensure high levels of customer satisfaction, understand trends and develop future resort programs and amenities. We then utilize this guest feedback to help us focus our capital spending and operational efforts to the areas of the greatest need.
•Season Pass & Epic Day Pass Products
We offer a variety of pass products, primarily season pass and Epic Day Pass products, for all of our Resorts that are marketed towards both out-of-state and international (“Destination”) guests as well as in-state and local (“Local”) guests. These pass products are available for purchase prior to the start of the ski season, offering our guests a better value in exchange for their commitment to ski at our Resorts before the season begins. Our pass program drives strong customer loyalty and mitigates exposure to more weather sensitive guests, leading to greater revenue stability and allowing us to capture valuable guest data. Additionally, our pass product customers typically ski more days each season than those guests who do not buy pass products, which leads to additional ancillary spending. In addition, our pass products attract new guests to our Resorts. Our pass products generated approximately 61% of our total lift revenue for Fiscal 2022. Sales of pass products are a key component of our overall Mountain segment revenue and help create strong synergies among our Resorts. Our pass products range from providing access for a certain number of days to one or a combination of our Resorts to our Epic Pass, which provides unrestricted and unlimited access to all of our Resorts. The Epic Day Pass is a customizable one to seven day pass product purchased in advance of the season, for those skiers and riders who expect to ski a certain number of days during the season, and which is available in three tiers of resort offerings. All of our various pass product options can be found on our consumer website www.snow.com. Information on our websites does not constitute part of this document.
As part of our continued strategy to drive pass product sales and create a stronger connection between key skier markets and our iconic destination mountain resorts, we have continued to expand our portfolio of properties in recent years. In August 2022, we acquired Andermatt-Sedrun, located in Switzerland, marking our first strategic investment in, and opportunity to operate, a ski resort in Europe. In December 2021, we acquired Seven Springs Mountain Resort, Hidden Valley Resort and Laurel Mountain Ski Area in Pennsylvania (collectively, the “Seven Springs Resorts”), which added three regional ski areas strategically located near Pittsburgh, expanding our presence in the Mid-Atlantic region and generating incremental drive-to business from other major metropolitan areas such as Washington DC, Baltimore and Cleveland. In September 2019, we acquired Peak Resorts, Inc., which added 17 regional ski areas strategically located near key U.S. population centers in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions. Additionally, we enter into strategic long-term season pass alliance agreements with third-party mountain resorts, which for the 2022/2023 ski season include Telluride Ski Resort in Colorado, Hakuba Valley and Rusutsu Resort in Japan, Resorts of the Canadian Rockies in Canada, Les 3 Vallées in France, Verbier 4 Vallées in Switzerland, Skirama Dolomiti in Italy and Ski Arlberg in Austria, which further increase the value proposition of our pass products.
Pass product holders also receive additional value in exchange for their advance commitment through our Epic Mountain Rewards program, which provides pass product holders a discount of 20% off on-mountain food and beverage, lodging, group ski school lessons, equipment rentals and more at our North American owned and operated Resorts. Epic Mountain Rewards is available for everyone who purchases an Epic Pass, Epic Local Pass, Epic Day Pass, Epic Military Pass and most of our other pass products, regardless of whether guests plan to ski one day or every day of the season. Additionally, Epic Coverage is included with the purchase of all pass products for no additional charge and provides refunds in the event of certain resort closures and certain travel restrictions (e.g. for COVID-19), giving pass holders a refund for any portion of the season that is lost due to qualifying circumstances. Additionally, Epic Coverage provides a refund for qualifying personal circumstances including eligible injuries, job losses and many other personal events.
•Premier Ski Schools
Our mountain resorts are home to some of the highest quality and most widely recognized ski schools in the industry. Through a combination of outstanding training and abundant work opportunities, our ski schools have become home to many of the most experienced and credentialed professionals in the business. We complement our instructor staff with state-of-the-art facilities and extensive learning terrain, all with a keen attention to guest needs. We offer a wide variety of adult and child group and private lesson options with a goal of creating lifelong skiers and riders and showcasing to our guests all the terrain our resorts have to offer.
•Dining
Our Resorts provide a variety of quality on-mountain and base village dining venues, ranging from top-rated fine dining restaurants to trailside express food service outlets. For the 2021/2022 ski season, we operated approximately 260 dining venues at our Resorts, which were impacted by restrictions and limitations as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 and to ensure the safety of our guests and employees, including limited food options at quick-service restaurants, spacing of tables in seating areas to allow for physical distancing and maintaining as much outdoor seating as possible. 
•Retail/Rental
We have approximately 340 retail/rental locations specializing in sporting goods including ski, snowboard and cycling equipment. Several of our rental locations offer delivery services, bringing ski and snowboard gear and expert advice directly to our guests. In addition to providing a major retail/rental presence at each of our Resorts, we also have retail/rental locations throughout the Colorado Front Range, the San Francisco Bay Area, Salt Lake City and Minneapolis. Many of our retail/rental locations near key population centers also offer prime venues for selling our pass products. 
•On-Mountain Activities
We are a ski industry leader in providing comprehensive destination vacation experiences, including on-mountain activities designed to appeal to a broad range of interests. During a normal winter season, in addition to our exceptional ski experiences, guests can choose from a variety of non-ski related activities such as snowtubing, snowshoeing, scenic snow cat tours, backcountry expeditions, horse-drawn sleigh rides and high altitude dining, although some of these activities were restricted or limited for the most recent winter season to ensure the safety of our guests and employees as a result of COVID-19 and as a result of labor shortages. During a normal summer season, our mountain resorts offer non-ski related recreational activities and provide guests with a wide array of options including scenic chairlift and gondola rides, mountain biking, horseback riding, guided hiking, 4x4 Jeep tours and our Epic Discovery program at Vail Mountain, Heavenly and Breckenridge, although some of these activities were restricted or limited for both the 2021 and 2022 summer seasons to ensure the safety of our guests and employees as a result of COVID-19 and as a result of labor shortages. The Epic Discovery program encourages “learn through play” by featuring extensive environmental educational elements interspersed between numerous activities, consisting of zip lines, children’s activities, challenge ropes courses, tubing, mountain excursions, an alpine slide and alpine coasters.
•Lodging and Real Estate
High quality lodging options are an integral part of providing a complete resort experience. Our owned and managed hotels and resorts proximate to our mountain resorts, including six RockResorts branded properties and a significant inventory of managed condominium units, provide numerous accommodation options for our mountain resort guests. Our recent real estate efforts have primarily focused on the potential to expand our destination bed base and upgrade our resorts through the sale of land parcels to third-party developers, which in turn provides opportunity for the development of condominiums, luxury hotels, parking and commercial space for restaurants and retail shops. Our Lodging and Real Estate segments have and continue to invest in resort related assets and amenities or seek opportunities to expand and enhance the overall resort experience.
Lodging Segment
Our Lodging segment includes owned and managed lodging properties, including those under our luxury hotel management company, RockResorts; managed condominium units which are in and around our mountain resorts in Colorado, Lake Tahoe, Utah, Vermont, New York, Pennsylvania and British Columbia, Canada; two NPS concessioner properties in and near Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming; a resort ground transportation company in Colorado; and company-owned and operated mountain resort golf courses, including five in Colorado; one in Vermont, one in Pennsylvania, one in Wyoming; one in Lake Tahoe, California; and one in Park City, Utah. For additional property details, see Item 2. “Properties”.
The Lodging segment currently includes approximately 5,900 owned and managed hotel rooms and condominium units. Our lodging strategy seeks to complement and enhance our mountain resort operations through our ownership or management of lodging properties and condominiums proximate to our mountain resorts and selective management of luxury resorts in premier destination locations.
In addition to our portfolio of owned and managed luxury resort hotels and other hotels and properties, our lodging business also features a Colorado ground transportation company, which represents the first point of contact with many of our guests when they arrive by air to Colorado. We offer year-round ground transportation from Denver International Airport and Eagle County Airport to the Vail Valley (locations in and around Vail, Beaver Creek, Avon and Edwards) and Summit County (which includes Keystone, Breckenridge, Copper Mountain, Frisco and Silverthorne). 
Lodging Industry/Market
Hotels are categorized by Smith Travel Research, a leading lodging industry research firm, as luxury, upper upscale, upscale, mid-price and economy. The service quality and level of accommodations of our RockResorts’ hotels place them in the luxury segment, which represents hotels achieving the highest average daily rates (“ADR”) in the industry, and includes such brands as the Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton and Marriott’s Luxury Collection hotels. Our other hotels are categorized in the upper upscale and upscale segments of the hotel market. The luxury and upper upscale segments consist of approximately 797,000 rooms at approximately 2,500 properties in the U.S. as of July 31, 2022. For Fiscal 2022, our owned hotels, which include a combination of certain RockResort hotels as well as other hotels in proximity to our Resorts, had an overall ADR of $309.78, a paid occupancy rate of 55.1% and revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) of $170.84, as compared to the upper upscale segment’s ADR of $201.53, a paid occupancy rate of 59.3% and RevPAR of $119.47. We believe that this comparison to the upper upscale segment is appropriate as our mix of owned hotels include those in the luxury and upper upscale segments, as well as 
some of our hotels that fall in the upscale segment. The highly seasonal nature of our lodging properties typically results in lower average occupancy as compared to the upper upscale segment of the lodging industry as a whole.
Competition
Competition in the hotel industry is generally based on quality and consistency of rooms, restaurants, meeting facilities and services, the attractiveness of locations, availability of a global distribution system and price. Our properties compete within their geographic markets with hotels and resorts that include locally-owned independent hotels, as well as facilities owned or managed by national and international chains, including such brands as Four Seasons, Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott, Ritz-Carlton and Westin. Our properties also compete for convention and conference business across the national market. We believe we are highly competitive in the resort hotel niche for the following reasons:
•all of our hotels are located in unique, highly desirable resort destinations;
•our hotel portfolio has achieved some of the most prestigious hotel designations in the world, including two properties in our portfolio that are currently rated as AAA 4-Diamond; 
•many of our hotels (both owned and managed) are designed to provide a look that feels indigenous to their surroundings, enhancing the guest’s vacation experience;
•each of our RockResorts hotels provides the same high level of quality and services, while still providing unique characteristics which distinguish the resorts from one another. This appeals to travelers looking for consistency in quality and service offerings together with an experience more unique than typically offered by larger luxury hotel chains;
•many of the hotels in our portfolio provide a wide array of amenities available to the guest such as access to world-class ski and golf resorts, spa and fitness facilities, water sports and a number of other outdoor activities, as well as highly acclaimed dining options;
•conference space with the latest technology is available at most of our hotels. In addition, guests at Keystone can use our company-owned Keystone Conference Center, the largest conference facility in the Colorado Rocky Mountain region with more than 100,000 square feet of meeting, exhibit and function space. The Seven Springs Resorts also provide conference services, offering over 77,000 square feet of meeting and function space;
•we have a central reservations system that leverages our mountain resort reservations system and has an online planning and booking platform, offering our guests a seamless and useful way to make reservations at our resorts; and 
•we actively upgrade the quality of the accommodations and amenities available at our hotels through capital improvements. Capital funding for third-party owned properties is provided by the owners of those properties to maintain standards required by our management contracts.
National Park Concessioner Properties
We own GTLC, which is based in the Jackson Hole area in Wyoming and operates within Grand Teton National Park under a concession agreement with the NPS with an initial term that would have expired on December 31, 2021. In June 2021, we agreed to an amendment to the agreement extending the term an additional two years, with an expiration date of December 31, 2023. We also own Flagg Ranch, located in Moran, Wyoming and centrally located between Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park on the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway (the “Parkway”). Flagg Ranch operates under a concession agreement with the NPS that expires October 31, 2028. GTLC also owns Jackson Hole Golf & Tennis Club (“JHG&TC”), located outside Grand Teton National Park near Jackson, Wyoming. GTLC’s operations within Grand Teton National Park and JHG&TC have operating seasons that generally run from mid-May through the end of September. 
We primarily compete with such companies as Aramark Parks & Resorts, Delaware North Companies Parks & Resorts, ExploreUS and Xanterra Parks & Resorts in retaining and obtaining NPS concession agreements. Four full-service concessioners provide accommodations within Grand Teton National Park, including GTLC. In a normal operating season, GTLC offers three lodging options within Grand Teton National Park: Jackson Lake Lodge, a full-service, 385-room resort with 17,000 square feet of conference facilities; Jenny Lake Lodge, a small, rustically elegant retreat with 37 cabins; and Colter Bay Village, a facility with 166 log cabins, 66 tent cabins, 337 campsites and a 112-space recreational vehicle park. We also operate two additional campgrounds separate from these facilities: the 304-site Gros Ventre Campground and 51-site Jenny Lake Campground. GTLC offers dining options as extensive as its lodging options, with cafeterias, casual eateries and fine dining establishments. Additionally we operate 11 retail outlets located throughout the GTLC properties. GTLC’s resorts provide a wide range of activities for guests to enjoy, including cruises on Jackson Lake, boat rentals, horseback riding, guided fishing, float trips, golf and guided Grand Teton National Park tours, although due to low water levels, certain retail locations and activities are not operating for the 2022 summer season. As a result of the extensive amenities offered, as well as the 
tremendous popularity of the National Park System, GTLC’s accommodations within Grand Teton National Park generally operate near full capacity during their operating season. 
Real Estate Segment
We have extensive holdings of real property at our mountain resorts primarily throughout Summit and Eagle Counties in Colorado. Our real estate operations, through Vail Resorts Development Company (“VRDC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary, include planning, oversight, infrastructure improvement, development, marketing and sale of our real property holdings. In addition to the cash flow generated from real estate development sales, these development activities benefit our Mountain and Lodging segments by (1) creating additional resort lodging and other resort related facilities and venues (primarily restaurants, spas, commercial space, private mountain clubs, skier services facilities and parking structures) that provide us with the opportunity to create new sources of recurring revenue, enhance the guest experience and expand our destination bed base; (2) controlling the architectural themes of our resorts; and (3) expanding our property management and commercial leasing operations.
The principal activities of our Real Estate segment include the sale of land parcels to third-party developers and planning for future real estate development projects, including zoning and acquisition of applicable permits. We continue undertaking preliminary planning and design work on future projects and are pursuing opportunities with third-party developers rather than undertaking our own significant vertical development projects. We believe that, due to the low carrying cost of our real estate land investments, we are well situated to promote future projects with third-party developers while limiting our financial risk. 
Marketing and Sales
Our Mountain segment’s marketing and sales efforts are focused on leveraging marketing analytics to drive targeted and personalized marketing to our existing and prospective guests. We capture guest data on the vast majority of guest transactions through sales of our pass products, our e-commerce platforms including mobile lift ticket sales, the EpicMix application and our lift ticket windows. We promote our Resorts using guest-centric omni-channel marketing campaigns leveraging email, direct mail, promotional programs, digital marketing (including social, search and display) and traditional media advertising where appropriate (e.g. targeted print, TV and radio). We also have marketing programs directed at attracting groups, corporate meetings and convention business. Most of our marketing efforts drive traffic to our websites, where we provide our guests with information regarding each of our Resorts, including services and amenities, reservations information, virtual tours and the opportunity to book/purchase our full suite of products (e.g. lift access, lodging, ski school, rentals, etc.) for their visits. We also enter into strategic alliances with companies to enhance the guest experience at our Resorts, as well as to create opportunities for cross-marketing.
For our Lodging segment, we promote our hotels and lodging properties through marketing and sales programs, which include marketing directly to many of our guests through our digital channels (search, social and display), promotional programs and print media advertising, all of which are designed to drive traffic to our websites and central reservations call center. We also promote comprehensive vacation experiences through various package offerings and promotions (combining lodging, lift tickets, ski school lessons, ski rental equipment, transportation and dining). In addition, our hotels have active sales forces to generate conference and group business. We market our resort properties in conjunction with our mountain resort marketing efforts where appropriate, given the strong synergies across the two businesses. 
Across both the Mountain and Lodging segments, sales made through our websites and call center allow us to transact directly with our guests, which further expands our customer base and enables analytics to deliver an increasingly guest-centric marketing experience. 
Seasonality
Ski resort operations are highly seasonal in nature, with a typical ski season in North America generally beginning in mid-November and running through mid-April. In an effort to partially mitigate the concentration of our revenue in the winter months in North America, we offer several non-ski related activities in the summer months such as sightseeing, mountain biking, guided hiking, 4x4 Jeep tours, golf (primarily included in the operations of the Lodging segment) and our Epic Discovery program. These activities also help attract destination conference and group business to our Resorts in our off-season. In addition, the operating results of our Australian Resorts, for which the ski season generally occurs from June through early October, partially counterbalances the concentration of our revenues during this seasonally lower period in North America. 
Our lodging business is also highly seasonal in nature, with peak seasons primarily in the winter months (with the exception of GTLC, Flagg Ranch, certain managed properties and mountain resort golf operations). We actively promote our extensive conference facilities and have added more off-season activities to help offset the seasonality of our lodging business. Additionally, we operate several golf courses proximate to our Resorts, as described above.
Sustainability & Social Responsibility
Sustainability remains a core philosophy for us. As a company rooted in the great outdoors, we have a unique responsibility to protect and preserve the incredible environments in which we operate. Through our corporate sustainability and social responsibility program, EpicPromise, we focus on climate change mitigation, resource conservation and building stronger local communities through contributions to local non-profit organizations. Our sustainability efforts are diverse and touch nearly every area of our operations. In 2017, we launched Commitment to Zero, our pledge to have a zero net operating footprint by 2030. This commitment includes (i) achieving zero net emissions by finding operational energy efficiencies, investing in renewable energy and investing in offsets and other emissions reduction projects, (ii) zero waste to landfill and (iii) zero net operating impact to forests and habitat by restoring an acre of forest for every acre displaced by our operations. 
As a result of this commitment, Vail Resorts was accepted as the first travel and tourism company into RE100, a collaborative initiative uniting more than 300 global and influential businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity. During Fiscal 2022, we continued to make progress toward our Commitment to Zero goals, despite operational adjustments made in response to COVID-19. Specifically, we focused on maintaining our robust composting and recycling diversion programs as much as possible. We furthered a pilot project to recycle snack wrappers at additional resorts and worked with strategic partners to create Adirondack chairs and a terrain park feature made from recycled wrappers and bottles for participating resorts. The 82-turbine Plum Creek Wind project we enabled came online in June 2020, and in Fiscal 2022 we purchased approximately 328,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of wind energy, addressing over 90% of the Company’s current electricity use across its 37 North American destination mountain resorts and regional ski areas. 
For over three years, Vail Resorts has worked with leaders from other ski companies to develop an industry-driven climate commitment. In June 2021 we, alongside Alterra Mountain Company, Boyne Resorts and POWDR, announced the Climate Collaborative Charter - the ski industry’s first unified effort to combat climate change. This partnership leverages our leadership in sustainability and is expected to accelerate our collective progress, leading the industry toward long-term transformational change.
In addition, during Fiscal 2022, we sponsored the reforestation of 80 acres in Colorado and California previously impacted by wildfire, which addressed 100% of the forests impacted by our operations over the year. Through direct Epic Promise grants and contributions from our $1 guest donation program, we partner with several local environmental organizations to fund restoration projects, including the National Forest Foundation, The Tahoe Fund, Grand Teton National Park Foundation, Mountain Trails Foundation in Park City and the EnviroFund at Whistler Blackcomb. We also encourage our employees to help protect the environment and support their local community by volunteering with various organizations.
For Fiscal 2022, our focus for the EpicPromise community impact grant program continued to be on COVID-19 response in our resort communities, including housing assistance, food security, equal access to education and other basic needs and services. In addition, we launched Epic for Everyone Youth Access in partnership with the Katz Amsterdam Foundation, hosting 917 urban youth to a 5-day snowsports program. We also continued our legacy access program with more than 7,400 youth participating in multi-day programs focused on mentorship, leadership and the impact of outdoor time on mental health in this unprecedented time. Finally, our EpicPromise Employee Foundation (the “Foundation”), which was established in 2015, is a charitable foundation funded by annual contributions from the Company, its employees and its guests. The Foundation supports Vail Resorts’ employees and their families via grants for emergency relief and scholarships. Annually more than $1 million in grants and scholarships are provided to help employees in times of need or to pursue educational opportunities. For more information on both the Foundation and our environmental stewardship, visit www.EpicPromise.com. Information on our websites does not constitute part of this document.
Human Capital Management
At Vail Resorts, our Talent Philosophy focuses on fully achieving our mission and vision by ensuring we have the talent in place to deliver on our future growth plans. We are truly passionate about our people, and we are focused on hiring and developing the best talent and building the best teams around them. At fiscal year end, we employed approximately 6,900 year-round employees. Over the course of our Resorts’ various winter and summer operating seasons in Fiscal 2022, we employed approximately 38,100 seasonal employees. In addition, we employed approximately 200 year-round employees and 100 seasonal employees on behalf of the owners of our managed hotel properties. We consider our employee relations to be positive.
During the third quarter of Fiscal 2022 we announced a significant increase in compensation for seasonal frontline staff. For the 2022/2023 North American ski season, we will be increasing our minimum wage to $20 per hour, while maintaining career and leadership differentials to provide a significant increase in pay to all of our hourly employees. We also announced a substantial investment in our human resource department to support a return to full staffing and deliver a better employee experience. The increase in wages and the return to normal staffing levels is expected to result in an approximately $175 million increase in expected labor expense in Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022, we announced a new mental health program available for all employees, even if they are not enrolled in an employer-sponsored healthcare plan, which includes free mental health therapy sessions. We have also recently established a Flexible Remote Work policy which allows employees to permanently work from any state in which we currently operate. 
Our talent philosophy recognizes that people are our most important asset in driving our business growth, and outlines the role that leaders play in attracting, developing, engaging and rewarding high performing, high potential talent, including supporting them to achieve their future career growth. Our talent management system enables leaders with programs and tools to effectively assess, develop and reward talent and includes regular Leadership Talent Review and Assessment processes to ensure that the caliber and capability of our talent aligns with the sophistication of our business strategies and processes. Our executive team reviews talent strategy and succession planning frequently, including with our Board of Directors, to assess current and future talent needs. We have a strong track record of hiring, developing and preparing high performing, high potential talent for internal mobility and succession and since 2018, we have nearly doubled our percentage of high performing, high potential talent through performance management and talent upgrades. As a result, succession for our senior leadership roles, is primarily sourced through internal talent development and promotion, rather than external hires (69% internal fill rate). Over the past two years, we announced internal successors for some of the most senior roles in our Company, including Chief Executive Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, President of the Mountain Division and Chief Operating Officer of Hospitality and Retail. Nearly all of our recent appointments of General Manager and Chief Operating Officers of our Resorts for the past three years came from internal succession.
To ensure we are building high performing teams, we encourage every employee at every level within the Company to continuously grow their leadership by participating in on-going leadership events that build leadership capability and drive aligned leadership expectations to enable business outcomes. We host an annual Leadership Summit that brings together our leaders at manager level and above to build understanding and alignment to business priorities, explore emerging leadership topics and build connections across our growing global business and organization. We offer ongoing digital leadership series discussions led by our CEO for this same population throughout the year and equip leaders to share learnings and insights from these sessions in dialogue with their teams for the benefit of the entire organization. Our leadership philosophy has a very strong emphasis on emotional intelligence and a leader’s ability to understand their own impact on others, and shape that impact to unlock the potential of their teams.
We offer a broad range of professionally designed leadership development programs, with differentiated development for our highest performing, highest potential employees who make up our long-term leadership succession pipeline. Building upon our culture of leadership development and in addition to the wage investment for seasonal, frontline talent announced in the third quarter of Fiscal 2022, we also announced a new focus on the frontline leadership development experience. For the 2022/2023 North American ski season, this includes relaunching our signature “Epic Service” training to inspire and equip frontline talent, who play the most important role in delivering a differentiated guest experience, to practice service-based leadership, which will be reinforced through a new daily in-resort frontline recognition program. The full Epic Service development platform will enable employees to choose curated learning experiences in the areas of Leadership – Self, Team, Guest Service and Business – that align with their specific motivations and career goals. Employee data will be used to build out a full portfolio of online and in-person learning programming to support these learning routes over time. Results impact will be measured by completion of required training, utilization and impact of the Epic Service recognition program and guest experience and Net Promoter scores.
Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a continuous listening survey to measure and understand the impact of COVID-19 and our response actions on employees, in order to make timely adjustments to maintain strong alignment and focus, and to care for the needs of our employees through a challenging and uncertain period. We have broadened our continuous listening survey objectives and approach to focus on the drivers of sustainable engagement. 
Vail Resorts Culture
Core to our human capital management strategy is our mission – to create an Experience of a Lifetime for our employees so they can in turn create an Experience of a Lifetime for our guests. We have a values-based leadership culture that places a premium on leader transparency, vulnerability and authenticity. We look for people to join Vail Resorts who are brave, passionate and ambitious. As Vail Resorts employees, we hold ourselves accountable for living these seven foundational values every day in everything we do: Serve Others, Do Right, Do Good, Be Safe, Have Fun, Be Inclusive and Drive Value. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe that diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) is core to both our company success and the future growth of our industry. At Vail Resorts, one of our core values is “Be Inclusive”, which means that we expect everyone at our Company to be welcoming to others, including all races, gender identities, sexual orientations, abilities and other differences.
    
We have a long history of building gender diversity throughout the Company. Women represent 48% of our corporate senior leaders at the director level and above and over 50% of our corporate roles generally. Ten resorts in our portfolio are led by women, including five of our seven largest resorts (Vail, Beaver Creek, Breckenridge, Park City and Crested Butte). Five of the ten directors on our Board are women and two of our nine executive committee members are women, and our Chief Executive Officer, Kirsten Lynch, is the only woman to head a Fortune 1000 company in travel and leisure. While women currently represent only approximately 20% of mountain operations senior leadership roles, we continue to strive to bring more gender diversity to these roles, which have historically been male-dominated. We have also developed Women in Leadership programs and a Women’s Employee Resources Group to foster an inclusive culture, and Forbes has previously named us one of America’s Best Employers for Women.
We are focused on improving racial diversity at Vail Resorts, as well as in our communities and our industry. To that end, we are working towards addressing barriers to attracting and retaining the best talent from BIPOC communities in order to fuel innovation and growth within our Company and industry. We are also incorporating more diverse representation in our marketing efforts, including more direct outreach to communities of color. Over the past two years, we have undertaken extensive efforts around DEI, including company-wide virtual webinars bringing forward diverse voices, DEI dialogues with external thought leaders, online DEI training modules aligned with our “Be Inclusive” value, and establishment of employee resource groups and affinity groups. As part of our commitment to driving sustainable change, we are listening and learning as a company, and the Company is part of CEO Action, Colorado Inclusive Economy and Civic Alliance. We are also focused on building support systems for a diverse employee population, including the development of Employee Resources Groups and Affinity Groups, including the recently launched Rainbow Room, an employee-founded and led affinity group focused on providing a supportive community for LGBTQ+ employees. This group provides a space for LGBTQ+ employees to connect, build community and support specific needs, challenges and successes to empower employees to bring their whole authentic selves to work.
We require our full-time, year-round employees, as well as certain seasonal employees, to complete annual training as part of our Code of Conduct. This annual requirement includes training on a variety of topics, including unconscious bias and anti-harassment. In Fiscal 2022, the training was completed by 98% of this employee base. Our Code of Conduct states that every employee is entitled to work in a respectful environment that is free of harassment, bullying and discrimination.
Mountain Safety
The nature of our on-mountain operations comes with inherent safety risks, and the health and safety of our employees is a top priority. It is the shared responsibility of every employee to actively participate in creating a safe and secure environment and to minimize injuries. To that end, we routinely:
•Provide resources and education to promote safe operating environments at our resorts, including compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards, as well as to improve overall workplace safety and health. 
This includes regular and ongoing safety training and assessments as well as safety audits, and all employees are required to take annual slope safety training.
•Proactively assess risks to identify and mitigate unsafe conditions and integrate learnings from incidents to prevent future occurrences across our network of resorts.
•Hire and train a dedicated health and safety team that oversees resort operations as well as highly trained ski patrol professionals at each resort.
COVID-19 Safety
The safety of our employees, guests and resort communities has been of utmost importance to us amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Our mountain operations, retail, lodging and other employees need to be onsite to carry out their work, and as part of our commitment to safety for these employees, as well as our guests and resort communities, we took extensive steps during the 2021/2022 winter season. We continue to monitor guidance from federal and local health authorities in evaluating the need for continued COVID-19 safety protocols with regard to ongoing operations and as we prepare for the 2022/2023 North American ski season, including recently updating our policies to remove the COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of employment, consistent with the withdrawal of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration vaccination and testing emergency temporary standard for large employers.
Employee Housing
Providing affordable employee housing is a critical lever to achieve our hiring and retention goals. While identifying and securing affordable housing options is challenging in some of the communities in which we operate, providing frontline employees affordable housing in our resort communities is a critical aspect of the employee value proposition. For the 2022/2023 North American ski season, we will serve approximately 6,700 frontline team members with affordable housing across our Resorts, as well as an additional 1,300 team members at GTLC for the 2023 summer season. This includes the addition of nearly 500 beds recently acquired or leased, including the 441-bed project at the base of Canyons at Park City to provide affordable housing opportunities to our full time seasonal and year round workforce. We have also announced plans for new affordable housing at Whistler Blackcomb and Vail Mountain for the 2023/2024 North American ski season that we expect will serve an additional 405 team members upon completion, which are subject to regulatory approvals.
Intellectual Property
The development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property as an important element of our success. Accordingly, we protect our intellectual property rights and seek to protect against its unauthorized use through international, national and state laws and common law rights. We file applications for and obtain trademark registrations and have filed for patents to protect inventions and will continue to do so where appropriate. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions.
In the highly competitive industry in which we operate, trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos are very important in the sales and marketing of our pass products, destination mountain resorts and regional ski areas, lodging properties and services. We seek to register and protect our trademarks, service marks, trade names and logos and have obtained a significant number of registrations for those trademarks. We believe our brands have become synonymous in the travel and leisure industry with a reputation for excellence in service and authentic hospitality. Among other national and international trademark registrations, the Company owns U.S. federal registrations for Epic®, Epic Pass®, Vail Resorts®, Vail®, Beaver Creek®, Breckenridge®, Keystone®, Crested Butte & Design®, Kirkwood & Design® and Heavenly®. The Company also owns Canadian and U.S. trademark registrations for the Whistler Blackcomb & Design® name and logo.
Environmental Compliance and other Laws and Regulations
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the environment, including laws and regulations governing water and sewer discharges, water use, air emissions, soil and groundwater contamination, the maintenance of underground and aboveground storage tanks and the disposal of waste and hazardous materials. Examples of such laws and regulations in the U.S. include the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the California Environmental Quality Act and the Vermont Land Use and Development Act. Internationally, we are subject to the Forest and Range Practices Act and Watershed Sustainability Act in British Columbia as well as the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW, Australia) and the Environment Protection Act 1970 and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Victoria, Australia). With the acquisition of Andermatt-Sedrun, the Company is required to comply with all Swiss regulations, including federal acts and ordinances, as well as Cantonal authorities.
Various federal, state, local and provincial regulations also govern our resort operations, including liquor licensing and food safety regulations applicable to our food and beverage operations and safety standards relating to our lift operations and heli-ski operations at Whistler Blackcomb. In addition, each resort is subject to and must comply with state, county, regional and local government land use regulations and restrictions, including, for example, employee housing ordinances, zoning and density restrictions, noise ordinances and wildlife, water and air quality regulations. We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with environmental and other laws and regulations. Compliance with such provisions has not materially impacted our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position, and we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact in the future.
Contracts with Governmental Authorities for Resort Operations
U.S. Forest Service Resorts
The operations of Breckenridge, Vail Mountain, Keystone, Crested Butte, Stevens Pass, Heavenly, Kirkwood, Mount Snow, Attitash and portions of Beaver Creek and Wildcat are conducted on land under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service (collectively, the “Forest Service Resorts”). The 1986 Ski Area Permit Act (the “1986 Act”) allows the Forest Service to grant Term Special Use Permits (each, a “SUP”) for the operation of ski areas and construction of related facilities on National Forest lands. In November 2011, the 1986 Act was amended by the Ski Area Recreational Opportunity Enhancement Act (the “Enhancement Act”) to clarify the Forest Service’s authority to approve facilities primarily for year-round recreation. Under the 1986 Act, the Forest Service has the authority to review and approve the location, design and construction of improvements in the permit area and many operational matters.
Each individual national forest is required by the National Forest Management Act to develop and maintain a Land and Resource Management Plan (a “Forest Plan”), which establishes standards and guidelines for the Forest Service to follow and consider in reviewing and approving our proposed actions.
Each of the Forest Service Resorts operates under a SUP, and the acreage and expiration date information for each SUP is as follows:

Forest Service Resort | Acres | Expiration Date 
Breckenridge | 5,702 | December 31, 2029 
Vail Mountain | 12,353 | December 1, 2031 
Keystone | 8,376 | December 31, 2032 
Beaver Creek | 3,849 | November 8, 2039 
Heavenly | 7,050 | May 1, 2042 
Mount Snow | 894 | April 4, 2047 
Attitash | 279 | April 4, 2047 
Wildcat | 953 | November 18, 2050 
Kirkwood | 2,330 | March 1, 2052 
Stevens Pass | 2,443 | August 31, 2058 
Crested Butte | 4,350 | September 27, 2058

We anticipate requesting a new SUP for each Forest Service Resort prior to its expiration date as provided by Forest Service regulations and the terms of each existing SUP. We are not aware of the Forest Service refusing to issue a new SUP to replace an expiring SUP for a ski resort in operation at the time of expiration. The Forest Service can also terminate a SUP if it determines that termination is required in the public interest. However, to our knowledge, no SUP has ever been terminated by the Forest Service over the opposition of the permit holder.
Each SUP contains a number of requirements, including indemnifying the Forest Service from third-party claims arising out of our operation under the SUP and compliance with applicable laws, such as those relating to water quality and endangered or threatened species. For use of the land authorized by the SUPs, we pay a fee to the Forest Service ranging from 1.5% to 4.0% of adjusted gross revenue for activities authorized by the SUPs. Included in the calculation are sales from, among other things, lift tickets, pass products, ski school lessons, food and beverage, certain summer activities, equipment rentals and retail merchandise.
The SUPs may be revised or amended to accommodate changes initiated by us or by the Forest Service to change the permit area or permitted uses. The Forest Service may amend a SUP if it determines that such amendment is in the public interest. While the Forest Service is required to seek the permit holder’s consent to any amendment, an amendment can be finalized over a permit holder’s objection. Permit amendments must be consistent with the Forest Plan and are subject to the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), both of which are discussed below.
The 1986 Act requires a Master Development Plan (“MDP”) for each ski area that is granted a SUP, and all improvements that we propose to make on National Forest System lands under any of our SUPs must be included in a MDP, which describes the existing and proposed facilities, developments and area of activity within the permit area. The MDPs are reviewed by the Forest Service for compliance with the Forest Plan and other applicable laws and, if found to be compliant, are accepted by the Forest Service. Notwithstanding acceptance by the Forest Service of the conceptual MDPs, individual projects still require separate applications and compliance with NEPA and other applicable laws before the Forest Service will approve such projects. We update or amend our MDPs for our Forest Service Resorts from time to time. 
Whistler Blackcomb
Whistler Blackcomb is comprised of two mountains: Whistler Mountain and Blackcomb Mountain. Whistler Mountain and Blackcomb Mountain are located on Crown Land within the traditional territory of the Squamish and Lil’wat Nations. The relationship between Whistler Blackcomb and Her Majesty, the Queen in Right of British Columbia (the “Province”) is largely governed by Master Development Agreements (the “MDAs”) between the Province and Whistler Mountain Resort Limited Partnership (“Whistler LP”) with respect to Whistler Mountain, and between the Province and Blackcomb Skiing Enterprises Limited Partnership (“Blackcomb LP”) with respect to Blackcomb Mountain. Together, Whistler LP and Blackcomb LP are referred to as the “Partnerships.”
The MDAs, which were entered into in February 2017, have a term of 60 years (expiring on February 23, 2077) and are replaceable for an additional 60 years by option exercisable by the Partnerships after the first 30 years of the initial term. In accordance with the MDAs, the Partnerships are obligated to pay annual fees to the Province at a percentage of gross revenues related to the operation of certain activities at Whistler Blackcomb.
The MDAs require that each of the mountains be developed, operated and maintained in accordance with its respective master plan, which contains requirements as to matters such as trail design and development, passenger lift development and environmental concerns. The MDAs grant a general license to use the Whistler Mountain lands and the Blackcomb Mountain lands for the operation and development of Whistler Blackcomb. The MDAs also provide for the granting of specific tenures of land owned by the Province to the Whistler LP or the Blackcomb LP, as applicable, by way of rights-of-way, leases or licenses. Each Partnership is permitted to develop new improvements to Whistler Mountain or Blackcomb Mountain, as the case may be, within standard municipal type development control conditions. We are obligated to indemnify the Province from third-party claims arising out of our operations under the MDAs.
Northeast Resorts
Stowe and Okemo operate partially on land that we own and partially on land we lease from the State of Vermont. With respect to Stowe, the land we own is on the Spruce Peak side of the resort while the land we lease from the State of Vermont is located on Mt. Mansfield in the Mt. Mansfield State Forest. The initial ten year term of the lease commenced in June 1967, and the lease provides for eight separate ten year extension options. The current term of the lease extends through June 2027, and there are three remaining ten year extension options. With respect to Okemo, we own the Jackson Gore base area land and lease most of the skiable terrain from the State of Vermont. The initial ten year term of the lease commenced in December 1963, and the lease provides for eight separate ten year extension options. The current term of the lease extends through December 2023, and there are three remaining ten year extension options. Under both leases, the land can be used for the development and operation of a ski area including ski trails, ski lifts, warming shelters, restaurants and maintenance facilities. For use of the land under the leases, we pay a fee to the State of Vermont based on revenue for activities authorized by the lease, such as lift tickets, pass products, food and beverage, summer activities and retail merchandise. We are obligated to indemnify the State of Vermont from third-party claims arising out of our operations under the lease.
Mount Sunapee lies within the Mount Sunapee State Park and operates on land that we lease from the State of New Hampshire. The initial twenty year term of the lease commenced in July 1998, and the lease provides for three separate ten year extension options. The current term of the lease extends through June 2028, and there are two remaining ten year extension options. The land can be managed and operated as a ski area and summer recreational facility, including all of its support activities, to provide year-round outdoor recreation. For use of the land under the lease, we pay a fee to the State of New Hampshire that includes both a base fee and a fee based on revenue from activities authorized by the lease, such as lift tickets, pass products, 
food and beverage, summer activities and retail merchandise. We are obligated to indemnify the State of New Hampshire from third-party claims arising out of our operations under the lease.
Laurel Mountain
Laurel Mountain Ski Area operates within Laurel Mountain State Park (“State Park”) under a Concession Lease Agreement (the “Lease Agreement”) with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, acting through the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (“Department”). The Lease Agreement, first entered into on October 15, 2018, allows for ski operations on approximately 387 acres of the State Park, including the existing ski area, buildings and equipment owned by the Department. The Lease Agreement is automatically renewed for a total of 35 one-year terms through October 31, 2051. We pay a fixed annual rent, as well and an additional amount based on the number of skier visits, with a cap subject to semi-annual consumer price index adjustments.
Australian Resorts
Perisher is located in the Kosciuszko National Park, the largest national park in New South Wales, Australia. The resort includes four villages (Perisher Valley, Smiggin Holes, Guthega and Blue Cow) and their associated ski fields, as well as the site of the Skitube Alpine Railway at Bullock’s Flat, which is accredited in accordance with the Rail Safety National Law (NSW) No. 82a. The Office of Environment and Heritage (“OEH”), an agency of the New South Wales government, which is part of the Department of Planning and Environment, is responsible for the protection and conservation of the Kosciuszko National Park. The National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 (NSW) (“NPW Act”) establishes the National Parks and Wildlife Service and is responsible for the control and management of the Kosciusko National Park.
The NPW Act requires the Kosciuszko National Park to be managed in accordance with the principles specified in that legislation, including the provision for sustainable visitor or tourist use and enjoyment that is compatible with the conservation of the national park’s natural and cultural values. The legislation also authorizes the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Heritage (the “Minister”) to grant leases and licenses of land within the Kosciuszko National Park for various purposes, including for purposes related to sustainable visitor or tourist use and enjoyment. Under this power, the Minister has granted to Perisher a lease and a license of specified land within the Kosciusko National Park until June 30, 2048, with an option to renew for an additional period of 20 years. The Minister has also granted Perisher a lease of the parking lot at Perisher Valley that expires on December 31, 2025. Subject to certain conditions being met, the lease for the Perisher Valley parking lot can be extended until June 30, 2048, with an option to renew for a further 20 years. The lease and license provide for the payment of a minimum annual base rent with periodic increases in base rent over the term, turnover rent payments based on a percentage of certain gross revenue, remittance of park user fees and certain other charges, also subject to periodic increases over the term.
Falls Creek and Hotham are located in the Alpine National Park in Victoria, Australia. Falls Creek and Hotham both operate on Crown land permanently reserved under the Crown Land (Reserves) Act 1978 (Vic), with the exception of three small parcels of freehold land within the Hotham resort area. Each resort is subject to the Alpine Resorts (Management) Act 1997 (Vic) (the “ARM Act”), which is in place to manage the development, promotion, management and use of the resorts on a sustainable basis and in a manner that is compatible with the alpine environment. The ARM Act established the Alpine Resorts Commission to plan for the direction and sustainable growth of Victoria’s five alpine resorts (including Falls Creek and Hotham). This includes review and coordination of the implementation of an Alpine Resorts Strategic Plan to which Falls Creek and Hotham are subject.
The ARM Act also established each of the Falls Creek Resort Management Board and Hotham Resort Management Board (the “RMBs”), each of which is appointed by, and responsible to, the Minister for Energy, Environment and Climate Change (the “Minister”). The RMBs are responsible for the management and collection of fees for entrance into the Alpine National Park and from Falls Creek and Hotham ski resorts. The ARM Act authorizes the RMBs to grant leases subject to Ministerial approval, and under this power, the entities operating the Hotham and Falls Creek resorts have each been leased land within the Alpine National Park under various long-term leases with differing expiration dates. The main lease for the ski field at Falls Creek expires December 31, 2040, while the main lease for the ski field at Hotham expires December 31, 2057. The key ski field leases provide for the payment of rent with both a fixed and variable component, a community service charge payable to the ARCC and a ski patrol contribution payable to RMBs. At Hotham, we also lease land known as ‘Dinner Plain’ within the Alpine National Park which expires on June 30, 2031, with an option to extend for a further 10 years.
The Alpine Resorts (Management) Regulations 2009 (Vic) gives the RMBs the power to declare the snow season, temporarily close the resort to entry if there is a significant danger to public safety, determine parts of a resort to which entry is prohibited, set aside areas of the resort for public use, parking, driving of vehicles, or landing of aircraft, and determine the areas for cross country ski trails, skiing, snowboarding and other snow play activities. 
Andermatt-Sedrun
Andermatt-Sedrun, acquired by the Company on August 3, 2022, is located in the Usern Valley of the Swiss Alps and comprises five mountains (Gemsstock, Nätschen, Sedrun/Oberalp, Realp and Valtgeva). Ski operations are conducted on land owned by ASA as freehold or leasehold properties, land owned by Usern Corporation, land owned by the municipality of Tujetsch and land owned by private property owners.
ASA holds three leasehold properties, which are owed by either Usern Corporation, a corporation under public law consisting of all the citizens of the Usern Valley, or the Swiss Confederation, namely the Federal Department of Defense, Civil Protection, and Sport (“DDPS”). For the land owned by Usern Corporation, ASA and Usern Corporation have entered into a main framework concession agreement, dated August 13, 2013, which sets forth the terms and conditions for the use of the land in connection with ski infrastructure facilities in the Gemsstock and Nätschen-Gütsch-Oberalp areas (“Ursern Framework Concession”). The Ursern Framework Concession was entered into for a fixed term until December 31, 2032. An application for renewal of the Ursern Framework Concession must be submitted at least 12 months prior to the expiration of the concession agreement, and we anticipate applying for the renewal. For the land owned by the Swiss Confederation, ASA has entered into leasehold agreements with the DDPS, which have a term of 50 years expiring on April 10, 2067 and March 13, 2068.
Another part of the land on which the Andermatt-Sedrun resort operations are conducted is owned by the municipality of Tujetsch. By means of a personal easement agreement dated October 12, 2012, ASA was granted various building rights and rights of way in order to build, operate and maintain the T-Bars and chairlifts on Tujetsch's property. The personal easement agreement was entered into for a fixed term until October 12, 2032, and we anticipate applying for renewal.
With respect to Swiss operations, companies who provide for regular and commercial passenger transportation by rail, road and water as well as by cable cars and elevators must obtain a passenger transport concession from the Federal Office of Transport (“FOT”). Under the Ursern Framework Concession, ASA was granted the required concessions for all ski infrastructure facilities and the usage of the ski slopes on the property of the Ursern Corporation. In the course of expanding the ski infrastructure facilities Urserntal-Oberalp, the FOT granted ASA passenger transport concessions for a total of 12 cableway installations by means of a plan approval dated May 30, 2014. Each passenger transport concession has a separate expiration date between 2026 and 2042, and we will then be able to apply for an extension or new concession. Additionally, the plan approval included concessions and approvals for ancillary installations such as ski slopes, snowmaking systems, rolling carpets, railway station passenger subway and clearings.
