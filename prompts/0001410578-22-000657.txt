ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
We are a technology-driven healthcare payer, which uses A.I. to predict and help prevent costly events for our members, and in turn lower our clients’ health care costs. Our mission is to positively change healthcare for the benefit of (i) our clients who are self- insured employers that pay for their employees’ healthcare benefits and engage us to administer the latter’s healthcare claims, and we refer to them as our “Clients”; (ii) employees who receive these healthcare benefits from our Clients, and we refer to them as our “Members”, and (iii) healthcare providers including, doctors, doctor groups, hospitals, clinics, and any other entities providing healthcare services or products, and we refer to them as the “Providers.” We are creating the healthcare payer of the future for self-insured employers in the U.S., what we refer to as the “Payer of the Future.” We provide administrative services, and act as Third-Party-Administrator (“TPA”) to self-insured employers who provide healthcare benefits to their employees. Most of our Clients are small and medium-sized companies as well as local government entities. Currently, we have over 60 Clients. We provide services to a total of over 20,000 of our clients’ employees, and including their spouses and dependents, we serve a total of over 40,000 members in 44 states in addition to the District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2021, no single client represents more than 6% of our annual revenue.
Industry Trends in the Healthcare Payer Market
Today, some megatrends are affecting all participants in the healthcare ecosystem, including payers, providers, and patients:

1. | Rising Healthcare Costs — Healthcare expenditures have grown in the U.S. from 5% of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in 1960 to 18% of GDP in 2019, according to Statistical, a consultancy. Per capital healthcare costs (adjusted for inflation and presented in 2020 dollars) increased from $5,801 in 1990 to $7,425 in 2000 to $10,222 in 2010, and these are projected to be greater than $12,000 in 2020 according to our analysis based on the Health System Tracker of the Peterson Center on Healthcare and Kaiser Family Foundation.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | A.I. to Help Manage Expansive Volume of Electronic Healthcare Data — The volume of all data of all types is estimated to double every two years, but healthcare data is growing at an even faster pace. In 2020, 2,413 exabytes of healthcare data will be generated compared to only 153 exabytes in 2013 (an exabyte is a billion gigabytes), according to Statista. With so much data, the latest breakthroughs in A.I., specifically in the field of deep learning, are beginning to make an impact in healthcare.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Consumerism in Healthcare — Devices that monitor our vital signs, such as the Apple Watch® and FitBit® as well as myriad health and wellness applications, demonstrate the trend toward having consumers at the center of healthcare, including trying to change behaviors that lead to better healthcare outcomes.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key drivers of healthcare cost increases are chronic diseases and various forms of waste.
Chronic diseases — According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and pulmonary conditions, account for 75% of the U.S. aggregate spending on healthcare each year. Our clients’ data also suggest that the cost of care for a Member with a chronic condition, such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”) and kidney diseases, is two to four times as much as the average cost of care for one without any chronic conditions. As many chronic diseases can be prevented and managed given early detection, it is vital that a patient who is on a path to develop these chronic diseases be identified and be given preventive care treatments as early as possible.
Waste — A survey of 54 peer-reviewed studies found that up to 30% of medical spending is wasted, according to “Waste in the US Health Care System — Estimated Costs and Potential for Savings,” published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (“JAMA”) in October 2019. Among the waste identified, they include:

● | Waste related to care coordination (organizing a patient’s care to achieve safe and effective care) — $27 billion to $78 billion annually;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1




● | Waste related to failure of care delivery (timely and effective care) — $102 billion to $166 billion annually; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Waste related to failure to obtain the best pricing — $231 billion to $240 billion annually.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In our own clients’ data, we see wide price variations for the same medical/healthcare procedure in the same city of between four and seven times the median cost. According to a study by UnitedHealth in published in May 2019, one of the largest payers in the U.S., reducing the cost variations of common tests could result in an annual saving of $18 billion. Our TopCare® program identifies top-rated test centers and healthcare providers with pricing information and allows us to steer a Member to get the same test (e.g., MRI, CT scan) with the same equipment but at a more competitive price by switching from one provider to another within the same geographic area.
Market Opportunities
According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, approximately 78.7% of U.S. companies with 500 or more employees offered a self-insured plan as of 2018. Collectively, private employers are the largest source of healthcare insurance in the U.S.
The market is dominated by the five largest healthcare payers — United Healthcare, BlueCross (including its licensee, Anthem), Aetna, Cigna and Humana — and according to their annual reports, they serve approximately 194 million Americans. The U.S. has an insured population of approximately 298 million, leaving 104 million people to be served by the thousand or so other insurers or TPAs based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners U.S. Health Insurance Industry 2019 Annual Results. Continental Benefits is partnered with 2 of the largest medical networks Cigna and Aetna and is considered a strategic partner for the larger firms to capture the “middle-market” of self-insured clients.
The average annual healthcare expenditure is approximately $11,000 per person, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) as of 2018. In other words, a total of approximately $1.2 trillion in claims of healthcare costs are processed by healthcare payers that are not one of the five largest payers in the U.S. Based on our analysis of actual per employee per month (“PEPM”) expenses received by us and the estimated employee lives of 39 million, according to McLellan Consulting Services, we believe the segment of the market served by third-party administrators presents us with a market opportunity of over $20 billion in revenue. This includes our administration fees as well as our share of revenue from selling other products such as care management services or telehealth services, to our clients.
Our A.I. Capabilities — Deep Learning
During the past few years, we have witnessed the greatest leap in performance in the history of A.I., largely due to a subfield of A.I. known as “deep learning” (or “deep neural networks”). While traditional machine learning methods require extensive manual processing (e.g., for feature extraction), deep learning methods allow for “end-to-end” learning, directly operating on raw data and predicting the final outcome.
The accuracy of deep learning-based models is significantly higher than traditional machine learning models especially when more data and more data types are available. This makes deep learning very relevant for big data platforms, which involve large quantities of data and various data types. Despite the huge success of deep learning in improving the state-of-the-art computer vision, speech recognition, text understanding, and other areas, few companies have the expertise to develop and deploy deep learning- based solutions, due to the numerous technical challenges involved. We believe that is why the application of deep learning remains limited in the healthcare space and primarily confined to medical image processing today.
We are creating a robust deep learning infrastructure that would allow us to analyze nearly any data type. More importantly, this infrastructure is expected to have the capability to automatically train on multiple data types at once and obtain unified predictions. Specifically, over time, we expect our deep learning capabilities to be used for the following data types:

● | Structured data — Any form of data that results in a tabular database. Examples of such data include laboratory tests, claims data, and payment details to healthcare providers. Our deep learning models for structured data, which rely on fully connected neural networks, allow us to automatically train on any such structured databases, and incorporate the insights into the predictive models.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2




● | Images — While traditional image processing requires cumbersome development for each specific use case, deep learning-based models can directly operate on any image data, without having to go through a preprocessing feature extraction phase. We are developing a series of deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks that could be extended for processing medical images, including radiology imaging such as MRI, CT Scan, X-Ray, Ultrasound, PET Scan, as well as processing other types of medical images, such as those in dermatology, pathology, and ophthalmology.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Text — Traditionally, analyzing text data requires lengthy natural language processing (“NLP”). Recent breakthroughs in deep learning, especially the advent of transformer networks (e.g., BERT), allow for end-to-end training of language models which are significantly more accurate than previous NLP methods. Our infrastructure includes support for these deep learning-based language models, allowing us to automatically process textual data as well. A prime example of textual medical data is the plain text description of doctors’ notes, which includes information about the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Even though some of this data, such as disease codes, appear in structured databases as well, the textual data contains significantly more information that does not appear elsewhere.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Multi-type data — Deep learning can also be applied on multiple data sources and data types. For each data type at the first stage, the relevant deep learning models are applied (e.g., CNN for images, Transformers for text, etc.), and then, at the second stage, the processed information from various data sources is fed into a secondary deep learning model, which will provide unified predictions. This is one of the major advantages of deep learning over traditional A.I., allowing it to incorporate multiple big data sources into a single unified prediction model, far exceeding the accuracy rate achieved by traditional methods.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Data fusion — We have the ability to study different data types together. Data that are images (e.g., CT scan) with data that are in tabular form (e.g., figures from healthcare claims). Putting these different data types together is data fusion.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The largest technology players have been aggressive recruiters of the top A.I. talent around the world. Marpai Health has been able to recruit and maintain top talent largely due to potential employees wanting to work with Dr. Eli David. As Dr. David maintains his professorship in the A.I. field, we believe he will continue to have a pipeline of qualified candidates, mostly Masters and PhD students, who are potential hires for us as our needs expand. We believe this will give us a competitive advantage.
Our TopCare® Program
We believe that our A.I. capabilities in the area of deep learning enable us to make more accurate predictions about costly healthcare events using data types that are hard or impossible to use using traditional A.I. This allows us to help our clients prevent costly healthcare events and reduce the growth of long-term healthcare spending while also improving the quality of healthcare, which is commonly known as “bending the cost curve” in our industry.
Continental Benefits has been providing its TPA services on its patent-pending TopCare® program for the past year. Since January 2021, our A.I.-powered TopCare program® became live, making it possible for us to offer care management with high-impact predictions. Our A.I. technology is able to process, analyze and store myriad types of data in large scale. Our A.I. models, collectively branded as FutureSight Advantage, recognize patterns and detect anomalies, giving us greater insights on a patient’s medical trajectory, although we do not provide medical prognosis, or are engaged in the practice of medicine of any sort. Our A.I.-enabled predictions generate real-time alerts based on that trajectory, which allow our call center staff to start outreaching and recommend the best care to an at-risk Member, whether that is a visit to a primary care physician or to a specialist, for a root cause or drill down analysis. With a full disclaimer to the Member that our system does not provide medical advice or prognosis, our call center staff encourages the Member to develop an actionable healthcare plan with licensed medical professionals. Using our innovative technology, TopCare® allows us to help self-insured employers manage their employees’ healthcare needs proactively.
The current data types our A.I. technology uses to predict healthcare needs include the following structured data:

● | Historical claims data (including a medical examination, referral request or pharmaceutical prescription);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Demographic information; and
--+-----------------------------

3




● | Blood test and other laboratory test data.
--+-------------------------------------------

In the future, we expect our A.I. technology to use the following unstructured data types to predict healthcare needs:

● | Pathology image;
--+-----------------


● | Advanced images from X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) and computed tomography (“CT”);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Electronic health records;
--+---------------------------


● | Health risk assessments;
--+-------------------------


● | Information gathered from applications used by Members; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | Information gathered from wearables like Fitbit devices and the Apple watch.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the future, we intend to incorporate clinicians directly into our TopCare® Program so that we may communicate directly with Members regarding the insights generated by our technology, subject to strict compliance with federal, state and local regulations. Our A.I.-enabled predictions help both Members and their Providers to be proactive and get in front of costly healthcare events, so they can predict, prevent, and plan around them. We believe our services to provide not only lower costs, but also better value for the money spent on healthcare, and therefore greatly reducing any waste related to care coordination and care delivery. Eventually, we hope our technology will inform Members as to any specific health risks they should be cognizant of, in order to adjust their behavior and medical care accordingly.
The key components of our TopCare® program include:

● | Deep Member Profile — We understand a Member’s health based on their medical history, demographic information, historical claims, and in some cases, what they have shared with us as their own health risk assessments. All this data is fed through various deep learning modules and automatically processed;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Claims Trajectory — Our A.I. models have studied millions of claims and have mapped out an expected trajectory for Members. The predictions are based on all available data on each Member. Currently, the data includes structured data, such as demographic information, historical claims, laboratory test data when available. In the future, we expect the data to include unstructured data, such as medical images, text-based assessments, and other types of health records. All these data will be fed into deep learning models for each data type, and subsequently fed into a unified deep learning model which finds patterns and insights across all data and data types available for the Member; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Alerts — Our A.I. models come to life via alerts, which are triggered by an event such as a particular claim. Each alert is a new data point for each Member, invoking the entire model to update its predictions. Deep learning models are especially superior for finding non-linear patterns and correlations. For example, a new data point X that apparently is completely unrelated to prediction Y, may actually affect it through complex non-linear patterns, which are very difficult for humans and traditional A.I. to find, but deep learning models are very good at finding those patterns, which trigger new actionable alerts. These alerts allow the TopCare® team to start outreaching to an at-risk Member.

Matching Members with High Quality Providers
Matching Members with high-quality providers is a key component of our services. Provider quality is continuously tracked and measured by feeding A.I. models with various provider quality databases. Monitoring providers’ outcomes, costs, and proper conduct will allow our models to score good and poor- quality providers as well as measure cost-efficiency. This information will allow us to assist Members in making more informed decisions on their healthcare provider options.
Although we do not provide medical prognosis or are engaged in the practice of medicine of any sort, we believe our A.I. technology can in the future process in-depth insights from laboratory results, imaging, and electronic health records to help us detect 

4



suspicious claims and potential over-treatment. These cases are always examined by clinicians and may be used to educate both Members and Providers, or otherwise steer Members to better healthcare solutions. High-performing Providers will be used by our A.I. models for developing the “gold standard” with respect to pricing models and to understand what is usual and customary in terms of costs.
Given the high price variability for expensive medical procedures, we want to steer Members to cost- effective but also high-quality providers. For instance, TopCare® may generate an alert for a Member who is on a trajectory to have a knee replacement surgery over the next twelve months. In that case, without specifically relaying the contents of our system-generated alerts to the Member, we will educate the Member early on his/her options in terms of highly rated orthopedic surgeons for that exact procedure within his/her geographic area. This may happen months before the actual surgery and involves the Member’s choice of care. This helps reduce any waste related to not obtaining the best pricing for healthcare options. Clients’ plans may also allow for incentives whereby the Member’s co-insurance is reduced or eliminated if he/she selects the high-quality and more cost-effective surgeon. In the future, subject to strict compliance to applicable federal, state and local laws, we plan to be able to share the insights generated by our alerts with our Members.
For our clients, we use A.I. to design and optimize plans and costs given the historical data of its employee population and its predicted costly healthcare events. This information forms the building-blocks of plan design, risk management, and plan optimization. Continuous monitoring of the at-risk population as well as measuring how mitigation strategies are working are also key components to lowering the overall cost of claims.
Part of the technology in our TopCare® offering also tracks member outreach to see how and if the Member has responded, and what communication vehicles are the most successful for a particular Member (e.g., text, email, phone call). This data helps us tailor outreach that best facilitates Member responses and, therefore, reduces waste related to care coordination and care delivery. The response is also fed through a feedback loop to the deep learning models to not only improve the predictions, but more importantly, the actionable alerts.
Our Products and Services
We differentiate ourselves by using A.I. to predict costly healthcare events before they happen. These predictions enable us to provide proactive intervention and superior care management to our clients. For example, our A.I. modules help to predict which Members are likely to develop a chronic disease or require a costly medical procedure over the next twelve months. With this information, we refer Members to high quality healthcare providers who may be able to help them postpone or eliminate the onset of the chronic disease, or the need for costly medical procedures. Healthier Members cared for by high quality providers translates into lower total cost of healthcare claims for employer groups. In the future, assuming strict compliance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations, we hope to be able to share the specific contents of these alerts directly with our Members.
Our current core product and service offering includes handling all aspects of administration related to a healthcare plan. We typically design for our Client a healthcare benefit plan which outlines exactly what coverage the Client would like to provide to its employees.
We then manage the plan for the Client by providing the following services:

● | Providing a Client’s employees access to a provider network via relationships with Aetna, Cigna, and regional networks;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Concierge type services to help members find providers and care management as well as to answer questions, such as on claims and benefits;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Validating and adjudicating claims from Clients’ employees, including automated adjudication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Promoting health and use of high-quality providers to the member population across clients;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Paying claims on behalf of our Clients; and
--+--------------------------------------------

5




● | Stop-loss insurance via one or several providers.
--+--------------------------------------------------

We do not bear the financial risk with respect to the cost of the claims for any employer. Instead, the self-insured employers and stop-loss insurance companies, if the self-insured employers purchase stop-loss insurance policies to protect themselves from having higher than planned healthcare costs, bear the risk arising from the cost of claims. We sell complementary services to our Clients including care management, case management, actuarial services, health savings account administration and bill review services. Our margin on these partner products varies greatly, but each service makes the overall package for our Clients more complete.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to create a proprietary technology platform enabling rapid growth in the healthcare payer market. With the use of A.I., we believe we can achieve our dual goals of lowering the cost of claims for Clients, while maintaining high quality healthcare outcomes for Members.
Today, we have already developed six A.I. modules to predict the following chronic conditions:

● | Type 2 Diabetes;
--+-----------------


● | Cardio-vascular disease;
--+-------------------------


● | Kidney disease;
--+----------------


● | Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);
--+----------------------------------------------


● | High-cost imaging of knee; and
--+-------------------------------


● | Knee replacement.
--+------------------

These modules allow us to identify which members to enroll in care management. In January 2021, our A.I.-powered TopCare program® became live, making it possible for us to offer care management with high-impact predictions. We plan to continue to develop our technology, expand the number of A.I. modules TopCare® will incorporate as well as other functionalities, and sign up as many Clients who will pay a premium price for this enhanced product offering as possible.
We leverage our A.I. capabilities to differentiate ourselves in the healthcare TPA market and expand our market footprint and penetration. We show Continental Benefits’ current Clients what their employee population may look like in terms of at-risk Members in the years to come, and how we can help them manage the related healthcare costs and design appropriate plans. We will continue to track Provider quality. We believe this approach will allow us to offer custom-made healthcare plans that can achieve the dual goals of improving Members’ general health by providing targeted and proactive intervention and optimization of care, while also controlling the escalating cost of claims and reducing waste in delivery of healthcare services.
Currently, our care management is provided by several third-party vendors. In the future, we may bring this function in-house. Care management functions may include telemedicine, prescription drug delivery, wellness programs and chronic condition management.
We intend to invest in the core infrastructure that will allow us to be a growth platform. These investments include expansion of our A.I. research and development team in Israel, as well as expanded technology infrastructure at Continental Benefits. We will also expand our sales and marketing efforts. Our growth strategy may also include acquiring other TPAs, who can add to our client base, and building complementary modules on our platform.

Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development. This investment includes hiring new A.I. scientists and acquiring data from third parties. We routinely use data from Clients, but also purchase data from other sources such as state entities, which capture claims and other healthcare data. When our team builds an A.I. model, we look to validate it with existing data. For example, we may work on data sets, which have Member data for five years. We commonly set the most recent year aside and build the models on the other four years. This allows us to test the predictions against available data, making validation of the models easier.
Currently, each FutureSight Advantage A.I. model is developed with the goal of helping redirect a costly event or prevent a chronic condition. Over the next 12 to 24 months, we plan to develop A.I. model- driven solutions for orthopedic surgeries, cardiovascular conditions, and kidney disease. In the future, we expect to also expand our research and development efforts to several other conditions, including respiratory disease, liver disease and forms of cancer.
Marpai Captive
Marpai Captive, Inc. was founded in March 2022 as a Delaware corporation. Marpai Captive is intended to be engaged in the captive insurance market. To date, Marpai Captive is in its initial exploratory phase and has not yet commenced its operations.
Marpai Health
Marpai Health, Inc. (originally named “CITTA, Inc.”) was founded in February 2019 as a Delaware corporation. Together with its wholly owned subsidiary, EYME, founded in March 2019 in Israel, Marpai Health engages in developing and marketing A.I. and healthcare technology to analyze data with the goal of predicting and preventing costly healthcare events related to chronic conditions and expensive medical and surgical procedures.
In August 2019, Marpai Health entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire a software system and big data analytics platform for research, analysis and prediction of security related events using A.I. for law enforcement agencies (the “Purchased Assets”). In August 2019, in connection with an asset acquisition, Marpai Health issued a convertible note in the principal amount of $2,930,000 (the “SQN Convertible Note”). The purchase price of the Purchased Assets was $3,250,000, consisting of $70,000 in cash, 31,250 shares of Marpai Health’s common stock, and the SQN Convertible Note in the aggregate principal amount of $2,930,000. Marpai Health has since customized the acquired software system and technology platform and built new A.I. modules on it for the purposes of porting the system to the cloud and making it available in a software as a service (“SaaS”) model to allow for usage in the healthcare industry and compliance with healthcare privacy and security regulations.
EYME serves as Marpai Health’s research and development center with thirteen A.I. and software researchers and engineers in Israel. Since its inception through April 1, 2021, the date of the acquisition of Continental Benefits, Marpai Health reported no revenues and as of that date had an accumulated deficit of $7.1 million, working capital deficit of $2.7 million and total debt of approximately $9.6 million.
Continental Benefits
Continental Benefits was founded in Florida as a limited liability company in November 2013. Continental Benefits was a wholly owned subsidiary of WellEnterprises USA, LLC which was founded in 2012. Continental Benefits provides benefits outsourcing services to clients in the U.S. across multiple industries. Continental Benefits’ backroom administration and third-party administration (“TPA”) services are supported by a customized technology platform and a dedicated benefit call center. Under its TPA platform and TopCare® program, Continental Benefits provides health and welfare administration, dependent eligibility verification, Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“COBRA”) administration, and benefit billing.
In September 2019, Marpai Health began to approach TPAs in an effort to commercialize its technology. Sharing the vision of bringing to market a healthcare “payer of the future” by using advanced A.I. technology in the TPA business, Marpai Health and Continental Benefits started to have discussions about information exchange, and joint development in December 2019 and Continental Benefits has been serving as Marpai Health’s A.I. products design partner ever since. Based on the data collected by Continental Benefits, Marpai Health developed various A.I. modules as well as a delivery system for its healthcare predictions. In August 2020, Marpai Health started to explore long-term strategic opportunities with Continental Benefits. In September 2020, the 

7



parties entered a letter of intent pursuant to which Marpai Health would acquire Continental Benefits. On April 1, 2021, pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Equity Interest Purchase and Reorganization Agreement (the “Purchase and Reorganization Agreement”), by and among Marpai, Inc., Marpai Health, all stockholders of Marpai Health, holders of convertible notes of Marpai Health, Continental Benefits, WellEnterprises USA, LLC and HillCour for the purpose of joinder, to effectuate Marpai, Inc.’s acquisition of Marpai Health and Continental Benefits, the stockholders of Marpai Health and the sole member of Continental Benefits contributed their respective securities and ownership interests in Marpai Health and Continental Benefits to Marpai, Inc. for a combination of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock of Marpai, Inc. (the “Acquisition”). Options to purchase 1,027,602 shares of Marpai Health common stock and warrants to purchase 1,366,746 shares of Marpai Health common stock were exchanged, on a one-to-one basis, for options and warrants to purchase shares of our Class A common stock. In addition, pursuant to a Note Exchange Agreement, we issued new notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,198,459 (the “New Notes”) in exchange for certain then outstanding convertible promissory notes of Marpai Health of equivalent amount of outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest. The SQN Convertible Note remained outstanding at the time of the acquisition. The SQN Convertible Note was mostly converted to equity at the Company’s IPO and remaining balance was repaid. For details on the Acquisition, see “Item 1. Business — Marpai, Inc.’s Acquisition of Marpai Health and Continental Benefits” below.
The healthcare industry is highly regulated, and the criteria are often vague, and subject to change and interpretation by various federal and state legislatures, courts, enforcement, and regulatory authorities. Only a treating physician can determine the condition and appropriate treatment for any individual patient. Our future prospects are subject to the legal, regulatory, commercial, and scientific risks.
Marpai, Inc.’s Acquisition of Marpai Health and Continental Benefits
On April 1, 2021, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase and Reorganization Agreement, the stockholders of Marpai Health and Continental Benefits contributed their respective ownership interests in Marpai Health and Continental Benefits to Marpai, Inc. for a combination of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock of Marpai, Inc., HillCour and WellEnterprises, LLC agreed to perform certain transition services for us pursuant to a Transition Services Agreement.
The Acquisition was treated as an integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and qualified as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to section 351 or 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
The Purchase and Reorganization Agreement required that Continental Benefits to not have less than $4.762 million of cash on hand, and to have no debt at the time of closing of the Acquisition.
Pursuant to the Purchase and Reorganization Agreement, Continental Benefits was valued solely for purposes of the Acquisition, on a cash-free and debt-free basis, at $8.5 million. Including the $4.762 million of cash on Continental Benefits’ balance sheet, equity totaled $13.26 million. In addition, pursuant to Purchase and Reorganization Agreement, Marpai Health was valued solely for purposes of the Acquisition at an assumed pre-money valuation of the last convertible note’s conversion price of $35 million.
As a result of the Acquisition,

● | We have acquired all of the then outstanding membership interests of Continental Benefits in exchange for 3,599,568 shares of our Class A common stock and 127,130 shares of our Class B common stock and, subject to certain adjustments as more fully described in the Purchase and Reorganization Agreement, based upon a valuation as a separate concern of $8.5 million on a cash free and debt free basis;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class B Conversion
On June 28, 2021, Eli David, Yaron Eitan, Edmundo Gonzalez, Grays West Ventures LLC, HillCour Investment Fund, LLC, and WellEnterprises USA, LLC converted an aggregate of 927,817 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock they held into 4,226,968 shares of Class A common stock on a one-to-one basis (“Class B Conversion”). Until the Class B conversion, the Company was authorized to issue two classes of common stock, Class A common stock and Class B common stock.

Power of Attorney and Proxy
Concurrently with the Class B Conversion, the Company, (i) HillCour Investment Fund, LLC and WellEnterprises USA, LLC (together, the “HillCour Founding Group”) and (ii) Eli David, Yaron Eitan, Edmundo Gonzalez and Grays West Ventures LLC (collectively, the “Grays Founding Group,” and together with the HillCour Founding Group, the “Co-Founders”) entered into the Power of Attorney and Proxy pursuant to which the HillCour Founding Group granted the Grays Founding Group the right to vote 1,560,237 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock it held (“Proxy Shares”) on all matters relating to any of the following: (i) change to the composition of the Company’s Board of Directors; (ii) sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets or capital stock, or a merger involving the Company; (iii) replacement of the Company’s CEO or other C-level officers; (iv) amendment or approval of any corporate documents or agreements in connection with the Company’s corporate structure or capital raising activities; (v) approval of the Company’s annual budget and business plan; and (vi) the Company’s acquisition, joint venture or other collaborative agreements. Consequently, the HillCour Founding Group and the Grays Founding Group currently have the right to vote 3,913,268 and 3,913,263 shares of the Company’s capital stock, respectively. The Power of Attorney and Proxy also provides that the number of Proxy Shares is subject to adjustment from time to time to maintain as much as possible, equal voting power in the Company between the HillCour Founding Group on the one hand and the Grays Founding Group on the other, subject to certain exceptions related to transfer of shares by the parties.
Pursuant to this Power of Attorney and Proxy, the Co-Founders have also agreed to vote all their shares for the election of (a) Damien Lamendola (or another nominee of the HillCour Founding Group), (b) Edmundo Gonzalez; and (c) Yaron Eitan (or up to two other nominees of the Grays Founding Group) as the Company’s directors. The Power of Attorney and Proxy is irrevocable and will remain in full force and effect until the earlier of (i) consummation of the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, or the acquisition of the Company by a third party (by way of stock acquisition, merger, recapitalization or otherwise), or (ii) the time when the Grays Founding Group collectively owns fewer than 1,882,420 shares of the Company’s capital stock.
Directors and Executive Officers
Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase and Reorganization Agreement, all of the directors of Continental Benefits resigned. Effective as of the Closing, the combined company’s board of directors was fixed at seven members and comprised of two former members of Marpai Health’s executive management team, four independent directors, and Damien Lamendola, the indirect majority owner of WellEnterprises USA, LLC and HillCour. The composition of the board of directors is expected to satisfy the requisite sophistication and independence requirements for audit committee members pursuant to Nasdaq listing requirements.
Our current management team consists of the following member of the former Marpai Health executive management team:

Government Regulation
Overview
We believe that our business and operations as outlined above are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Only a treating physician can determine if a prediction made by our TopCare® program is correct or appropriate for any individual patient. However, Marpai does not currently share its TopCare® predictions with patients or their providers. Our future prospects are subject to the legal, regulatory, commercial, and scientific risks outlined below and under the section titled, “Risk Factors.”
The healthcare industry is highly regulated and continues to undergo significant changes as third-party payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, traditional indemnity insurers, managed care organizations and other private payers, increase efforts to control cost, utilization, and delivery of healthcare services. Healthcare companies are subject to extensive and complex federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and judicial decisions.

11



Health Care Reform
The Affordable Care Act or the ACA was enacted into law in 2010. The provisions of the ACA are comprehensive and varied and are generally directed at implementing health insurance reforms to increase health insurance coverage and reduce the number of uninsured and reshaping the health care delivery system to increase quality and efficiency and reduce cost. Certain provisions of the ACA took effect immediately or within a few months, while others will be phased in over time, ranging from one year to ten years. Because of the complexity of health care reform generally, additional legislation is likely to be considered and enacted over time. The ACA, and any subsequent health care reform legislation, will require the promulgation of substantial regulations with significant effect on the health care industry. Thus, the health care industry may be subjected to significant new statutory and regulatory requirements, and consequently to structural and operational changes and challenges, for a substantial period.
Reimbursement
Neither we nor our self-insured clients receive reimbursements from federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. If in the future, we receive reimbursements from these programs, which are subject to complex statutory and regulatory requirements, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy, determinations by fiscal intermediaries and government funding restrictions, all of which would materially increase or decrease reimbursement to our Company.
Fraud and Abuse
Health care fraud and abuse laws have been enacted at the federal and state levels to regulate both the provision of services to government program beneficiaries and the methods and requirements for submitting claims for services rendered to such beneficiaries. In addition, certain fraud and abuse laws may extend to payer sources other than federal or state-funded programs. Under these laws, individuals and organizations can be penalized for various activities, including submitting claims for services that are not provided, are billed in a manner other than as actually provided, are not medically necessary, are provided by an improper person, are accompanied by an illegal inducement to utilize or refrain from utilizing a service or product, or are billed in a manner that does not comply with applicable government requirements. Both individuals and organizations are subject to prosecution under the criminal and civil fraud and abuse statutes relating to health care providers.
The federal anti-kickback law (the “Anti-Kickback Law”) prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering or receiving remuneration to induce the referral of items or services that are reimbursable by a federal health care program. The Office of Inspector General has issued a series of regulations, known as the “safe harbors” which immunizes the parties to the business arrangement from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Law. The failure of a business arrangement to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the arrangement is illegal. Many states have adopted laws like the Anti- Kickback Law, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payer, including private insurers.
The so-called Stark Law prohibits physician referrals of Medicare patients to an entity providing certain “designated health services” if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationship with the entity and the financial relationship does not fall within one of the enumerated exceptions to the Stark Law. In addition to the Stark Law, many states have their own self- referral bans, which may extend to all self-referrals, regardless of the payer.
The federal False Claims Act imposes liability for the submission (or causing the submission) of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. The knowing and improper failure to return an overpayment can serve as the basis for a False Claims Act action and Medicare and Medicaid overpayments must be reported and returned within 60 days of identification. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action. Various states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state health care programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to all payers.
The federal Healthcare Fraud Statute prohibits the knowing and willful execution of a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including a private insurer. It also prohibits falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services. In addition, state analogs often prohibit similar conduct.

State and Federal Privacy and Data Security Laws
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and its implementing regulations (HITECH) govern the collection, use, disclosure, maintenance and transmission of identifiable patient information (“Protected Health Information” or “PHI”). HIPAA and HITECH apply to covered entities, which may include health plans as well as to those entities that contract with covered entities (“Business Associates”). HITECH imposes breach notification obligations that require the reporting of breaches of “Unsecured Protected Health Information” or PHI that has not been encrypted or destroyed in accordance with federal standards.
In addition, other federal and state laws afford additional protections to certain categories of sensitive information. Such protections are commonly afforded to substance abuse, mental health, or information concerning certain contagious diseases.
In addition to the federal privacy and security laws and regulations, most states have enacted data security laws, and breach notification laws, governing other types of personal data such as employee and customer information.
State Managed Care Laws
State insurance and managed cared laws and regulations regulate the contractual relationships with managed care organizations, utilization review programs and third-party administrator activities. These regulations differ from state to state, and may contain network, contracting, and financial and reporting requirements, as well as specific standards for delivery of services, payment of claims, and adequacy of health care professional networks. These laws may apply to the Company in the event we engage in business transactions with state managed care programs.
Corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting and laws
Many states have laws prohibiting physicians from practicing medicine in partnership with non- physicians, such as business corporations. In addition, many states, including New York, prohibit certain licensed professional, like physicians, from sharing professional fees with non-licensees. As we do not engage in the practice of medicine, we do not contract with licensees to render professional medical services, and we do not split fees with any medical professionals, we do not believe these laws restrict our business. We merely monitor and analyze historical claims data, including our Members’ interactions with licensed healthcare professionals and recommend the most suitable healthcare providers and/or sources of treatment. We do not provide medical prognosis or healthcare. In accordance with various states’ corporate practice of medicine laws and states’ laws and regulations which define the practice of medicine, our call center staff are prohibited from providing Members with any evaluation of any medical condition, diagnosis, prescription, care and/or treatment. Rather, our call center staff can only provide Members with general and publicly available information that is non-specific to the Members’ medical conditions and statistical information about the prevalence of medical conditions within certain populations or under certain circumstances. Our call center staffs do not discuss Members’ individual medical conditions and are prohibited from asking Members for any additional protected health information (PHI) as such term is defined under HIPAA. Our call center staff have been trained and instructed to always inform Members that they are not licensed medical professionals, are not providing medical advice, and that Members should reach out to their medical provider for any medical advice.
However, any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of those contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, and have an adverse effect on our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us. In the event that in the future we will share or allow access by Members to the contents of our alerts or related information, we will endeavor to do so only in full compliance with regulatory requirements, including, potentially, those regulations regarding the corporate practice of medicine, fee- splitting laws, and medical profession regulation.
State Laws Governing Licensure of Healthcare Professionals
State professional licensing boards contain requirements for the licensure of health care professionals and typically require a healthcare professional who is providing professional services in that state to be licensed. Some state licensing boards specifically address the licensure of professionals who are providing services via telephone or other electronic means. The requirements for 

13



licensure generally apply where individuals are engaged in a licensed activity. If we elect to hire a licensed professional to engage in a licensed profession, those individuals may be subject to state licensing laws. In addition, hiring licensed professionals may implicate state prohibitions on the corporate practice of medicine.
Finally, as a TPA, we must maintain active TPA licenses in all states that are not expressly exempt from requiring a TPA license where we conduct business.
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we have a total of 148 full-time employees, with 15 of them located in Tel Aviv, Israel. None of them are parties to any labor agreements or are represented by a labor union. Except for Ronnie Brown, our Chief Operating Officer, all our executive officers are full-time employees.
Competition
Although we believe that the services, we offer our Clients are highly differentiated, we operate in a highly competitive market. We only provide administrative services to self-insured employers who provide healthcare benefits to their employees. These self-insured employers can always elect to abandon self- insurance and simply buy medical insurance from one of the large players such as, Aetna, Cigna, or United Healthcare. There can be no assurances that our Clients or prospective Clients will remain self-insured for any given period. If the number of employers which choose to self-insure declines, the size of our targeted market will shrink.
Also, there are other technology-driven companies focused on creating a TPA business among self- insured employers. Like us, they provide machine learning predictions models targeted at measuring risks for Members, identifying members susceptible to adverse healthcare events before they occur, and provide proactive guidance for preventive care. We compete with almost 1,000 TPAs, all of whom are vying for the same business — the management of healthcare benefits for self-insured employers. There is only one TPA at a time for every employer wanting to provide health benefits via a self-insured model, and an employer may remain with the same TPA for many years. This means that although the market is very large, not all of it is accessible by us in any one year. In addition to the very large health insurance companies, there are new players in the market such as Collective Health, Bind Health Insurance, Bright Health Group (NYSE: BHG), Oscar Health, Inc. (NYSE: OSCR) and Centivo, which have all raised substantial venture capital funds, are pursuing a similar strategy to ours, and share our vision to use technology to transform the healthcare payer space. We believe that like us, Collective Health and Clover Health are also targeting at self-insured employers. Although all of them are relatively young companies, they have products in the market already and are known to provide technology- driven TPA services. These companies claim to save employers money and also claim to have high retention rates.
Some of the competitors named above perform care management functions as part of their offerings. Currently, we offer this function through our strategic partners. In the future, we may bring this function in- house. We believe our A.I.-enabled predictions further differentiate our solution by being able to steer Members to the appropriate healthcare Provider sooner. The ultimate gauge of success in our market will be who can help employers reduce the growth of long-term healthcare spending while also improving the quality of healthcare solutions.
Impact of COVID-19
In managing our ongoing our daily operations, in the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, we are taking all necessary precautions for the safety and well-being of our employees. We are continuing normal ongoing activities, subject to the directives of the relevant authorities. In addition, the majority of our employees have been vaccinated and we are using remote work technologies that enable the mitigation of office staff. To-date we estimate that the COVID-19 global pandemic did not have a material impact on our financial results, however, the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic is constantly evolving, and we may experience further impacts on our daily operations, including the need for our employees to potentially self-isolate based on potential exposure to the virus, which may lead to delayed or cancelled sales as well as difficulties in meeting contractual commitments to our customers.
