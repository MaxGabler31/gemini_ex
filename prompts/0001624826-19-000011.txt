ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
MPM Holdings Inc. (“Momentive”) is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its business through its subsidiaries. Momentive’s wholly owned subsidiary, MPM Intermediate Holdings Inc. (“Intermediate Holdings”), is a holding company for its wholly owned subsidiary, Momentive Performance Materials Inc. (“MPM”) and its subsidiaries. 
As a result of MPM’s reorganization and emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on October 24, 2014 (the “Effective Date” or the “Emergence Date”) (described below), Momentive became the indirect parent company of MPM in accordance with MPM’s plan of reorganization (the “Plan”) pursuant to MPM’s emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on the Emergence Date. Prior to its reorganization, MPM, through a series of intermediate holding companies, was controlled by investment funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Management Holdings, L.P. (together with Apollo Global Management, LLC and subsidiaries, “Apollo”).
Momentive is one of the world’s largest producers of specialty silicones and silanes and a global leader in fused quartz and specialty ceramics products. Momentive is based in Waterford, New York and has a long track record of creating innovative products and solutions designed to meet the complex requirements of our more than 4,000 customers in over 100 countries. Our strategic network of 24 production sites and 12 R&D facilities supports our global leadership positions and facilitates our ability to serve our blue-chip customer base across a diverse array of consumer, automotive and various industrial end-markets. We have invested significantly to develop and enhance our innovative and differentiated specialty product portfolio to address the evolving demands of the markets we serve and to maintain alignment with global megatrends.
Our value-added business model focuses on technical service, combined with our global footprint and long-term customer relationships uniquely positions us as a key innovation partner to our customers. Over our 75-year operating history, which began with the invention of silicone technologies by General Electric Company (“GE”) and includes our acquisitions of the silicone-based businesses of Bayer, Toshiba and Union Carbide, we have focused on investing in and developing technology to enable high performance applications in attractive end-markets. Our silanes and specialty silicones are used as additives and formulated products that provide or enhance certain attributes of the end product. Our products have a range of attractive properties including heat and chemical resistance, lubrication, adhesion and viscosity. These properties position our specialty silicones and silanes products as critical materials in many automotive, industrial, construction, healthcare, personal care, electronic, consumer and agricultural applications. Momentive’s advanced materials are ubiquitous in daily life and are instrumental inputs in a wide range of products, including applications in consumer and personal care (e.g., cosmetics, electronic displays, and foam mattresses), automotive (e.g., 
 3

headlights, paneling, and tires) and healthcare (e.g., medical tubing). The diverse molecular characteristics of specialty silicones and silanes continually lead to new applications, and as a result are increasingly being used as a substitute for other materials. 
Our value-added, technical service-oriented business model enables us to identify and participate in high-margin and high-growth specialty markets. We are focused on investing in our R&D capabilities, which enable us to develop new products and applications. Over the last three years, we have invested approximately $200 in R&D, dramatically upgrading our capabilities and facilities. For example, we implemented a full scale pilot line for our coatings business in Leverkusen, Germany and opened a new tire additives application development center in Charlotte, North Carolina. Our investments in strategically-located R&D centers of excellence enable us to quickly and effectively develop new products and maintain our technology leadership. We have long-term relationships with blue-chip customers which are leading innovations in their own industries, and work closely with their R&D teams to develop products uniquely suited to their needs. 
We generate revenue in three of our segments, Performance Additives, Formulated and Basic Silicones and Quartz Technologies, using direct and indirect approaches to selling a broad base of products to our customers. We utilize technical and application support to enhance our value proposition to customers and drive penetration into attractive end-markets. We also work with original equipment manufacturers to achieve specification of our products into theirs, which results in higher pull-through demand.
On September 13, 2018, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with MOM Holding Company, a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and MOM Special Company, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”).  Parent is a wholly owned subsidiary of affiliates of SJL Partners, LLC, a limited liability company formed under the laws of South Korea (“SJL”), KCC Corporation, a South Korean corporation (“KCC”), and Wonik Holdings Co., Ltd., a South Korean limited company (“Wonik” and, together with SJL and KCC, the “Investors”).  The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Momentive (the “Merger”), with Momentive surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.  The transaction is valued at approximately $3,100, which includes the assumption of net debt, pension and certain other postretirement liabilities. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of Momentive, KCC, Wonik, and the investment committee of SJL and by Momentive’s stockholders holding a majority of Momentive’s common stock, Parent will assume Momentive’s net debt obligations. Momentive stockholders will receive as merger consideration $32.50 for each share of common stock they own subject to a downward adjustment in the event that the aggregate cash held by the Company at the end of the last calendar quarter prior to completion of the Merger is less than $250. The transaction will be financed through a combination of cash and new debt that will be put in place at closing. The transaction is not subject to any financing contingency and is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to requisite regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. 
Products and Markets
Our products are used in thousands of applications and are sold into diverse markets, such as industrial, building and construction, transportation, agriculture, electronics, healthcare, personal care, semiconductor and fiber optics. The diversity of our products limits our dependence on any one market or end-use. We have a history of product innovation and success in introducing new products to new markets, as evidenced by more than 3,400 patents as of December 31, 2018, the majority of which relate to the development of new products and manufacturing processes.
As of December 31, 2018, we had 24 production sites strategically located around the world, which allows us to produce the substantial majority of our key products locally in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Through this network of production facilities, we serve more than 4,000 customers between our Performance Additives, Formulated and Basic Silicones, and Quartz Technologies businesses in over 100 countries worldwide. We use our global platform to deliver products to companies efficiently on a worldwide basis. Many of our customers are expanding internationally to serve developing areas in Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, India and Russia. Maintaining close proximity to our international customers allows us to serve them more quickly and efficiently and thus build strong relationships. Our customers include leading companies in their respective industries.
We believe that our scale and global reach provide significant efficiencies in our fixed and variable cost structure and that our breadth of related products provides significant operational, technological and commercial advantages. Manufacturing capacity at our internal sites and our joint venture in China is sufficient to produce the majority of one of our key intermediates, siloxane, which facilitates a cost effective operating structure and security of supply.
We believe we have created a value-added, technical service-oriented business model that enables us to target and participate in high-margin and high-growth specialty markets. These specialty markets account for the majority of our revenues and continue to be a growing part of our business.
 Growth and Strategy
Momentive has a clear corporate growth strategy and significant multi-dimensional earnings growth opportunities. We are focused on the following long-term strategies: 
Increase our siloxane sourcing. In October 2018, we exercised a contractual right acquiring an additional ownership interest for approximately $30 in Zhejiang Xinan Momentive Performance Materials Co., Ltd, a joint venture in China which manufactures siloxane, one of our key intermediate materials. As a result, our ownership interest in this joint venture was increased to 49% from 25%.

Increase shift to high-margin specialty products. Our strategy is to expand our product offerings in high-margin specialty silicones and silanes and optimize production to accommodate strategic investments in specialty growth products as the company rationalizes exposure to lower margin products. We are actively selling fewer lower-margin basic silicone products and redeploying capital resources to grow our specialty products. Accordingly, we have deployed approximately $140 of growth capital over the last three years to leverage our rich new product pipeline in innovative market applications. Areas of investment focus include specialty silanes, automotive clear coats, optical displays and liquid silicone rubber (“LSR”). For example, construction of our previously announced approximately $30 investment in NXT* silane production capacity in Leverkusen has been completed and we expect that production will ramp up in 2019. Simultaneously, we continue to expand our IP-protected leadership position in next generation silanes for low-roll resistance tires. With these actions, we are continuing to invest strategically in our specialty growth platforms while optimizing our siloxane capacity. 
Expand our global reach in faster growing regions and markets. We intend to continue to grow by expanding our sales presence and application support around the world. We are focused on growing our business by making targeted investments in emerging markets, specifically certain areas of Asia Pacific, India and Latin America. 
Develop new applications and market new products. We intend to maintain industry leadership through new product development and innovation initiatives. We aim to establish new relationships with customers and third parties to create next generation solutions. In the last five years, we generated approximately 13% of our revenue from new products, including several instances in which we co-developed applications with our customers. 
In addition, we will continue to invest in R&D capabilities by upgrading our technology facilities and expanding our new product offerings. In recent years, we upgraded technology facilities at our Tarrytown, New York site, implemented a full scale pilot line for our coatings business in Leverkusen, Germany and opened a new tire additives application development center in Charlotte, North Carolina, all of which further complement our network of innovation centers strategically located to support our customers globally. Throughout the course of 2017 and 2018, we commissioned two state of the art pilot plants in Nantong, China and Waterford, New York to accelerate commercialization of new innovative material solutions, serving both our Performance Additives and Formulated and Basic Silicones segments. Both pilot plants are expected to improve new product market adoption and drive growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific region. Through these investments, we expect to continue to drive incremental revenue and earnings growth. 
Invest in high-return capital projects. We have a history of investing capital in high-ROI growth projects to expand product sets, customer penetration and increase capacity to service rapidly expanding sales. Over the last three years, we have invested approximately $140 into growth capital projects. We constantly evaluate the highest and best use of each incremental growth capital dollar and consult with our partners to ensure we are prepared to efficiently get to market. 
Continue portfolio optimization, targeted add-on acquisitions and joint ventures. We will continue to pursue acquisitions of attractive businesses and technologies that provide exposure to higher-end specialty products and services. For example, in 2017 we acquired the operating assets of Sea Lion Technology, Inc. (“Sea Lion”) to further support the silanes business. Sea Lion was a contract manufacturer that worked with Momentive to produce silane products, including NXT silane, for more than 10 years. We believe the acquisition of Sea Lion together with our expanded NXT capacity in Leverkusen will enable us to strategically leverage production assets in support of our high-growth NXT business. 
We will continue to pursue other acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the attractive specialty silicone and silane, quartz, and specialty ceramics spaces. As a leading manufacturer of performance materials we have an advantage in pursuing add-on acquisitions and joint ventures in areas that allow us to build upon our core strengths and expand our product, technology and geographic portfolio to better serve our customers. We believe we will have the opportunity to consummate acquisitions at relatively attractive valuations due to the scalability of our existing global operations and deal-related synergies.

Identify and implement strategic cost reduction initiatives. We are committed to driving cost reductions and efficiencies throughout our global manufacturing footprint, including through implementing LEAN / Six Sigma initiatives and right sizing siloxane production. Our management team has a robust process to effectuate cost reduction plans and continuously reviews our operations to identify and evaluate further cost reduction opportunities. The team develops detailed process plans to facilitate staffing and execution, appoints a team leader and works with a steering committee to remain on track. The cost reduction plan we have put in place over the last three years is just the latest example of our ability to effectively implement such initiatives. We plan on achieving approximately $63 in annual structural cost reduction initiatives during 2019. Cumulatively through December 31, 2018, we have achieved approximately $55 of savings under these initiatives.
Industry and Competitors
We compete with a variety of companies, including large global chemical companies and small specialty chemical companies, in each of our product lines. The principal factors of competition in our industry include product quality, customer service and breadth of product offerings, product innovation, manufacturing efficiency, distribution and price.

The following paragraphs discuss our reportable segments, their corresponding major product lines and the primary end-use applications of our key products as of December 31, 2018.
Performance Additives
2018 Net Sales: $973

Our Performance Additives segment is one of the leading manufacturers of urethane additives, silicone fluids and silanes. Our liquid additives are key ingredients in our customers’ products and are used to improve or enable the performance characteristics and processability of a variety of products across different end-markets including automotive, personal care, agriculture, consumer and construction. Our silicone fluids, silanes, and urethane additives product lines are developed using a range of raw material inputs and generally use less siloxane than Formulated and Basic Silicone products. 
Products
Our portfolio consists of technology driven, proprietary products that enable high performance applications: 

• | Urethane additives product lines— Urethane additives include silicone stabilizers and tertiary amine catalysts, as well as organic-based foam property modifiers. Our products are essential ingredients in polyurethane foam processing, controlling the internal structure of the material to optimize properties such as the insulation performance of rigid foams in construction applications, the firmness and breathability of a foam mattress or the rebound and cushioning in a running shoe.


• | Specialty fluids product lines— Specialty silicone fluids are liquid polymeric materials that act like chains and can vary in lengths to create liquids that are very thick and barely flow or relatively thin and flow like water. Silicone fluids are used in personal care products as an additive in shampoos and conditioners to improve the look and feel of hair. Silicone fluids are also used in a variety of industrial applications, including the production and refining of crude oil, to reduce the formation of foam or separate water from oil.


• | Silanes product lines— Silanes are a group of additives that act as connectors or coupling agents. Our cross-linking agents form a three-dimensional network of siloxane bonds between constituents, which facilitates resistance to water or chemical intrusion, high temperatures, abrasion or other common deteriorating conditions, without compromising other important product features such as ductility. Examples include applications that enable stronger adhesion of rust-proof coatings to metal structures in construction and clear coat paints to automotive coatings. Our NXT silane product line connects silica-based fillers to the tire tread rubber, improving compound viscosity and resilience and maintaining dynamic properties at low temperatures, while simultaneously reducing mixing steps in the manufacturing process. Our NXT silane is uniquely positioned as a cost-effective patented solution that helps tire manufacturers meet U.S. and European green tire standards. We estimate the potential demand for NXT silane products in automobiles is approximately $1 billion and we estimate that we are approximately 10% penetrated into the opportunity. 

End-Markets and Applications
The physical properties of performance additives make them versatile products with broad commercial applications. In the automotive industry, performance additives are used to improve bonding performance of clear coat paints and improve compound viscosity and resilience of tire tread rubber. In the personal care industry, performance additives are used in consumer goods such as hair care and shaving products, antiperspirants and deodorants, cosmetics and shower and bath products. In the consumer goods industry, performance additives are used in the production of foam used in mattresses and running shoes, among other applications. We believe that such a broad range of commercial uses not only helps to maintain a steady demand for our products in industries that are less vulnerable to economic cycles, but also allows for continuous innovation leading into new applications for our products in high-growth industries.

These products can be used in a range of consumer electronics applications, as well as in critical aerospace and aviation applications with high temperature and stress resistance. In flat-panel displays, our hardcoat products provide protection and extend the exterior durability of plastics, while our ultra-clear liquid silicone rubber delivers high transmittance, low cure shrinkage, good elasticity and high stability in light emitting diodes (“LEDs”).


• | Elastomers product lines — Our chemically inert heat-cured elastomers have excellent mechanical properties for extrusion, molding and calendaring. Our low-viscosity, pumpable LSR can promote easier injection molding of complex articles. Our Ultra Clear LSRs provide heat and UV resistance without sacrificing optical clarity and are molded into lenses or light guides for automotive or other applications. Elastomers are also used as gasket material to seal and protect systems in under-hood applications in automotive and in appliances. Our LSR products, including medical tubing, enable cost-efficient, high-quality end-products for our customers in various applications across automotive, consumer goods, healthcare and electronics.


• | Sealants product lines — Our construction sealants are used in some of the world’s tallest skyscrapers to adhere and seal the windows into the frames on the sides of the building. Momentive is the exclusive global licensee of GE-branded silicone products, which are used in a wide range of construction and consumer applications.


• | Basic silicones product lines — Basic silicones, comprised of silicone-based cyclic or linear polymers, were the earliest materials developed by the industry. They are still utilized in a wide range of applications, including industrial lubricants and additives in personal and home care products. Basic silicones are a core input into our other formulated products.

End-Markets and Applications
The physical properties of formulated and basic silicones make them versatile products with broad commercial applications. In the transportation industry, silicones are used in a variety of original equipment manufacturer and aftermarket applications. In the electronics industry, silicones’ tolerance to high temperatures give them a considerable advantage relative to other traditional materials in a variety of computer and electronic manufacturing applications. In the healthcare industry, silicones are used in medical equipment, as well as in surgeries and other general medical procedures. In the building and construction industry, silicone sealants and caulks are used to seal expansion and control joints in pre-cast exterior concrete panels and metal curtain walls, as well as in siding, window and door perimeters. We believe that such a broad range of commercial uses not only helps to maintain a steady demand for our products in industries that are less vulnerable to economic cycles, but also allows for continuous innovation leading into new applications for our products in high-growth industries.

Quartz Technologies
2018 Net Sales: $210
Our Quartz Technologies segment is a global leader in the development and manufacturing of fused quartz and non-oxide based ceramic powders and shapes. Fused quartz products are manufactured from quartz sand and are used in processes requiring extreme temperature and high purity. Momentive’s high-purity fused quartz materials are used for a diverse range of applications in which optical clarity, design flexibility and durability in extreme environments are critical, such as semiconductor, lighting, healthcare and aerospace. Our product line includes tubing, rods and other solid shapes, as well as fused quartz crucibles for growing single crystal silicon. Our Quartz Technologies segment’s products are the material solution for silicon chip semiconductor manufacturing. 
We have also expanded into the primary pharmaceutical packaging market, producing fused quartz vials used for safely packaging, transporting and storing sensitive liquid-based parenteral drug formulations. Our Quartz Technologies segment has developed a new, state-of-the-art process to mass-produce fused quartz vials, which we are in the process of commercializing under the PurQ brand. Quartz vials are 99.995% pure SiO2, a level of purity which not only ensures unparalleled chemical durability, but also ensures exceptional inertness which can minimize a drug formulation’s physical interaction with the vial surface, resulting in superior liquid drug stability.
Products
Our Quartz Technologies business’ products are used as a superior substitute for glass. On a microscopic level, normal glass is filled with impurities, bubbles and other flaws. For this reason, applications that require transparency and a high level of purity or stress-resistance (such as process equipment for semiconductor manufacturing or lamp lenses for high intensity video projectors) require the use of quartz. A

significant driver of our Quartz Technologies volumes derives from semiconductor chip manufacturers adding to or adjusting their manufacturing lines for newly developed products. The manufacture of quartz products for use in the production of semiconductors generated approximately 76% of our Quartz Technologies business’ revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 74% and 72% in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Raw Material Purchases
Overall, in 2018, we purchased approximately $1.1 billion of raw materials. Many of the raw materials we use to manufacture our products are available from more than one source, and are readily available in the open market. As discussed above, we currently purchase under short-term, one-year or multi-year contracts and in the spot market so as to ensure competitive pricing and adequate supply.
Performance Additives and Formulated and Basic Silicones

• | Silicon Metal— Silicon metal is an inorganic material that is not derived from petrochemicals and represents approximately 12% of our 2018 raw materials purchases. Major silicon metal suppliers include Ferroglobe PLC, Elkem ASA, Lao Silicon Ltd., CBC Co. Ltd., and other smaller vendors located around the world. We currently purchase silicon metal under short-term, one-year or multi-year contracts and in the spot market. We typically purchase silicon metal under formal contracts in the United States and in the spot market in Asia Pacific. 


• | Siloxane— Siloxane is a key intermediate required to produce silicone polymers. We are one of two producers in the silicones market with global siloxane production capacity. We produce siloxane for our internal use in Waterford, New York and Ohta, Japan and source siloxane from our joint venture in Jiande, China and third parties. We also source siloxane under a purchase and sale agreement with Asia Silicones Monomer Limited (“ASM”) and from time to time, we enter into supply agreements with other third parties to take advantage of favorable pricing and minimize our costs.


• | Methanol— Methanol is a key raw material for the production of methyl chloride, which is used to produce chlorosilanes. Major methanol suppliers include Itochu Chemical Forontier Corporation, CBC Co. Ltd., Southern Chemical Corporation, and Mitsubishi Gas Chemicals. We typically enter into quarterly or annual contracts for methanol.

Quartz Technologies
Naturally occurring quartz sand is the key raw material for many of the products manufactured by our Quartz Technologies business, which is currently available from a limited number of suppliers. While we also use quartz sand from several global sand suppliers, one of our suppliers, a major producer of natural quartz sand, controls a significant portion of the market for this sand. In December 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement with this supplier, which expires on December 31, 2021. 
Marketing, Customers and Seasonality
We market an extensive product line to meet a wide variety of customer needs. We focus on customers who are, or have the potential to be, leaders in their industries and have growth objectives that support our own growth objectives. In addition, we focus on customers who value our service-oriented business model. This approach includes high-quality, reliable products backed by local sales support and technical expertise. An important component of our strategy is to utilize our broad product capabilities to win high-end specialty business from our customers. These customers value these capabilities and, as a result, we are able to become a supplier of choice, given our relationship and ability to develop solutions to meet their precise needs.
In 2018, our largest customer accounted for less than 4% of our net sales, and our top twenty customers accounted for approximately 22% of our net sales. Neither our overall Company nor any of our businesses depends on any single customer or a particular group of customers; therefore, the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on any of our businesses or the Company as a whole.
We do not experience significant seasonality of demand, although sales have historically been slightly higher during the second and fourth quarters due to increased industrial activity. Seasonality trends, however, have been skewed in recent years primarily due to volatile global economic conditions.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses include wages and benefits for research personnel, including engineers and chemists; payments to consultants and outside testing services; costs of supplies and chemicals used in in-house laboratories; and costs of research and development facilities. Our research and development efforts focus on the development of new applications for our existing products and technological advances that we hope will lead to new products.

Intellectual Property
As of December 31, 2018, we owned, licensed or had rights to approximately 3,400 patents and approximately 170 trademarks registered in a variety of countries, along with various patent and trademark applications and technology licenses around the world. These patents will expire between 2019 and 2038. Our rights under such patents and licenses are a significant strategic asset in the conduct of our business. Patents, patent applications, trademarks and trademark applications relating to our Velvesil, Silwet, Silsoft, Tospearl, SPUR+ and NXT brands, technologies and products are considered material to our business.
Solely for convenience, the trademarks, service marks and tradenames referred to in this report are without the “®” and “TM” symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the rights of the applicable licensors to these trademarks, service marks and tradenames.
Industry Regulatory Matters
Domestic and international laws regulate the production and marketing of chemical substances. Although almost every country has its own legal procedure for registration and import, laws and regulations in the European Union, the United States, and China are the most significant to our business. These laws typically prohibit the import or manufacture of chemical substances unless the substances are registered or are on the country’s chemical inventory list, such as the European inventory of existing commercial chemical substances and the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act inventory. Chemicals that are on one or more of these lists can usually be registered and imported without requiring additional testing in countries that do not have such lists, although additional administrative hurdles may exist. Under such laws, countries may also require toxicity testing to be conducted on chemicals in order to register them or may place restrictions on the import, manufacture and/or use of a chemical. 

The European Commission enacted a regulatory system in 2006 known as REACH, which requires manufacturers, importers and consumers of certain chemicals to register these chemicals and evaluate their potential impact on human health and the environment. As REACH matures, significant market restrictions could be imposed on the current and future uses of chemical products that we use as raw materials, or that we sell as finished products in the European Union. Other countries may also enact similar regulations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Future chemical regulatory actions may decrease our profitability.” 
Environmental Regulations
In the European Union and other jurisdictions committed to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, there is an increasing likelihood that our manufacturing sites will be affected in some way over the next few years by taxation of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, although the Trump administration announced in June 2017 its intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, numerous cities and businesses and several states, including California and New York, have made their own commitments towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and further enactment of federal climate change legislation in the United States is a possibility for the future. While only a small number of our sites is currently affected by existing greenhouse gas regulations, and none has experienced or anticipates significant cost increases as a result, it is likely that greenhouse gas emission restrictions will increase over time. Potential consequences of such restrictions include increases in energy costs above the level of general inflation, as well as direct compliance costs. Currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites. 
Our policy is to strive to operate our plants in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities. We have implemented company-wide environmental, health and safety policies and practices managed by our Environmental, Health and Safety, or EH&S department, and overseen by the Environment, Health and Safety Committee of the Board of Directors. Our EH&S department has the responsibility to monitor and enforce the compliance of our operations worldwide with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. This responsibility is executed via training, communication of environmental, health and safety policies, formulation of relevant policies and standards, environmental, health and safety audits and incident response planning and implementation. Our environmental, health and safety policies and practices include management systems and procedures relating to emissions to air, water and other media, waste generation, process safety management, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, worker health and safety requirements, emergency planning and response and product stewardship. 
We and our operations involve the use, handling, processing, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulation at the federal, state, local and international level. Our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal or modification. Violations of environmental, health or safety laws or permits may result in, among other things, restrictions being imposed on operating activities, substantial fines, penalties, damages or other costs. In addition, statutes such as CERCLA and comparable state and foreign laws impose strict, joint and several liability for investigating and remediating spills and other releases of hazardous materials, substances and wastes at current and former facilities and at third-party disposal sites. Other laws permit individuals to seek recovery of damages for alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to hazardous substances and conditions at or from our facilities or to hazardous substances otherwise owned, sold or controlled by us. Therefore, we may incur liabilities in the future, and these liabilities may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 9

Although our environmental, health and safety policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with international, federal, state and local laws and environmental, health and safety regulations, future developments and increasingly stringent regulation could require us to make additional unforeseen environmental, health and safety expenditures, which expenditures could be material. 
We expect to incur future costs for capital improvements and general compliance under environmental, health and safety laws, including costs to acquire, maintain and repair pollution control equipment. In 2018, we incurred capital expenditures of approximately $14 on an aggregate basis to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to make other environmental, health and safety improvements. We estimate that our capital expenditures in 2019 for environmental, health and safety improvements at our facilities will be approximately $37. This estimate is based on current regulations and other requirements, but it is possible that a material amount of capital expenditures, in addition to those we currently anticipate, could be necessary if these regulations or other requirements or other facts change. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 5,200 employees. Approximately 43% of our employees are members of a labor union or have collective bargaining agreements.
