General
 
Sierra Monitor Corporation, a California corporation (the “Company”, “Sierra Monitor”, “we” or “us”), was founded in 1978. The Company addresses the industrial and commercial facilities management market with Industrial Internet of Things (“IIoT”) solutions that target facility automation and facility safety requirements, also referred to as “Connect” and “Protect”.
 
On March 28, 2019 the Company signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by MSA Safety Incorporated (MSA), a global safety equipment manufacturer. Under terms of the agreement, Sierra Monitor Corporation will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of MSA Safety. Upon closing, each issued and outstanding share of SMC common stock (other than shares owned or held in treasury by SMC) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive $3.25 in cash. Under the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, MSA Safety will assume vested or unvested and outstanding SMC stock options and restricted stock awards granted to SMC employees.

Products and Applications
 
Our FieldServer family of protocol gateways, routers, and network explorers targets facility automation requirements, and is used by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and system integrators to enable local and remote monitoring and control of assets and facilities. The FieldServer family of products works with the FieldPoP™ device cloud portal; a cloud-based service that registers and manages FieldServer products, provides secure remote access to the local web-based applications that run on FieldServer products, and integrates with third-party applications over REST APIs. With more than 200,000 installed gateways supporting over 140 protocols such as BACnet, LonWorks, MODBUS, and XML in commercial and industrial facilities, FieldServer is the industry’s leading multi-protocol gateway brand and is delivered in a variety of form factors appropriate to the asset being interfaced. The intellectual property in FieldServer products is embodied in the proprietary embedded software that runs on a variety of customized hardware platforms with different connectivity options such as Serial, Ethernet, WiFi, or cellular. In addition to bridging data protocols between various assets or devices within a facility, the embedded software includes value-added “fog” or “local application” software for monitoring, logging, alarming, and trending local field data. Additionally, the embedded software enables the assets or devices in the facility to securely connect to third-party clouds and to Sierra Monitor’s own FieldPoP device cloud. The FieldPoP device cloud portal is a proprietary, secure, and scalable Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product and is developed and deployed using the same core technologies and providers that are used by many of the world’s leading web sites and Internet-based services. In 2018, combined revenue from sales of our FieldServer family of products was approximately 52% of our sales compared to approximately 51% in 2017.
 
Our Sentry IT fire and gas detection solutions target facility safety requirements, and are used by industrial and commercial facilities managers to protect their personnel and assets. The motivation for installing gas detection systems is driven, in part, by industrial safety professionals guided by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration, state and local governing bodies, insurance companies and various industry rule-making bodies. The solution consists of proprietary system hardware that runs embedded controller and gateway software, detector modules that sense the presence of various toxic and combustible gases and flames, connectivity between the modules and the controller, and a user interface and applications that a facility manager can interact with, either locally on site or remotely over the Internet. The complex software embedded in the various products facilitates system-wide functions such as calibration, alarm detection, notification, and mitigation. The controller software also includes local web-based applications that simplify management of the complete solution and a gateway to integrate the fire and gas detection solution with the facility’s local supervisory system or to Sierra Monitor’s device cloud portal. With more than 100,000 detector modules sold, our fire and gas detection solutions are deployed in a variety of facilities, such as oil, gas and chemical processing plants, wastewater treatment facilities, alternate fuel vehicle maintenance garages and other sites where hazardous gases are used or produced. Revenue from gas detection products was approximately 44% of our sales in 2018, compared to 43% in 2017.
 
Our solutions are also sold to telecommunication companies and their suppliers to manage environmental and security conditions such as temperature, gas, and smoke in remote structures such as local DSL distribution nodes and buildings at cell tower sites. Revenue from all products sold to the telecommunications industry was approximately 5% of our sales in 2018, compared to 6% in 2017.
 
Research and Development
 
We maintain research and development programs to develop new products and to enhance and support existing products. We use a core group of experienced engineers, supported by a dynamic network of third-party specialists with skills as needed by specific projects. Our research and development expenses, which include costs for sustaining engineering and technical support, were $3,159,157 or 14% of our sales in 2018, compared to $3,073,087 or 16% of our sales in 2017.

Sales and Distribution
 
We use a combination of in-region sales managers and a centralized inside sales and customer support team. Our in-region sales managers are located in western, central, southern and eastern regions of North America. Additionally, we have in-region sales managers in Europe, the Middle East and Canada. The regional sales managers are supported by our inside sales and customer support team based in Milpitas, California.
 
Our FieldServer products are sold to hundreds of OEMS and integrators who then use the product as part of their system integration projects. We target OEMs in North America and Europe and integrators worldwide through in-region sales managers supported by inside sales and customer support team at our headquarters in Milpitas, California. Our FieldServer products are also available from leading on-line catalog distributors of industrial products.
 
Our Sentry products are primarily sold to engineering and installation firms that utilize the products as part of larger fire and safety facility projects. Our in-region and headquarters-based sales teams work with a network of independent sales representatives and value-added resellers to identify and fulfill such opportunities. After-sale service is carried out by certified service partners. There are currently 28 authorized representative companies in the United States and approximately 16 international sales partners. The majority of our domestic representatives have exclusive territories and the sales agreements with each representative restrict them from representing competing products.
 
Our marketing activities include maintaining a comprehensive and search-optimized web site and social media presence, participating in relevant trade shows and events, issuing newsletters, blogging, conducting on-line seminars and other forms of communication, seeking press coverage, and developing tools to assist in the selling effort.
 
Our combined sales and marketing expenses for 2018 were $5,656,137 or 26% of revenue, compared to $5,165,931 or 26% of revenue in 2017.
 
We consider that we operate in one business segment. Substantially all of the revenues reported in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are attributable to sales to that single segment. See “Note 8: Segment Reporting” to our Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, we had a total of 82 full-time employees and consultants. At that date, 57 were located in Milpitas, California, and the rest were based out of regional offices.
Seasonality and Customer Concentration
 
The demand for monitoring devices and other products we manufacture is typically not seasonal. There were no customers to whom sales exceeded 10% of our net sales during 2018, or 2017. Factors affecting specific industries, such as telecommunications, building automation or petro-chemical processing, could affect our sales within any of those industries. Those factors may include, but are not limited to, a general economic downturn, labor problems, and rapid shifts in technology or introduction of competing products at lower prices.

Backlog
 
The commercial order backlog for our products at December 31, 2018 was approximately $4,296,427 compared to approximately $4,943,137 at December 31, 2017. The backlog includes orders for which we have not yet received engineering release from the customer. Since we generally ship many of our products within the same quarter that we receive a purchase order and engineering release from the customer, we believe that our backlog at any particular time is generally not indicative of the level of future sales.
Competition
 
The facility management market for automation and safety applications is highly competitive and generally price sensitive. The solutions that address this market compete on reliability, ease of use, product support, price, and increasingly, the ability to enable the IIoT vision.
 
Our FieldServer family of protocol gateway products competes in the building or industrial automation industries with products or alternate methods and technologies offered by, among others, Honeywell Tridium, Contemporary Controls, HMS, Control Solutions Inc., Loytec Electronics, and in some cases protocol gateway functionality developed in-house by device or system OEMs. In application areas outside of building and industrial automation where multi-protocol translation requirements are fewer, FieldServer protocol gateways may compete with gateways provided by companies such as Dell and Advantech. Our FieldPoP device cloud may compete with cloud-based platform offerings from companies such as PTC/ThingWorx, Amazon AWS IoT, Microsoft Azure IoT, Google Cloud, and other IoT startup companies.
 
Our Sentry IT gas detection products compete with systems offered by Draeger Safety Inc., Mine Safety Appliance Company, Honeywell Life Safety, TYCO, and the Detector Electronics division of UTC. Most of these competitors in the fire and gas detection area offer broad product lines including items that do not compete with our products and have greater financial, marketing and manufacturing resources than we do.
 
Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
We purchase materials and components for use in manufacturing our products. The majority of the materials and components used in our products are standard items which can be purchased from multiple distributors or fabricated by multiple custom fabrication vendors. Components which are generally purchased from sole sources are those which require a specific consistent quality such as gas sensors. Our principal suppliers of gas sensors are City Technology, Dynament and E2V Technologies. We anticipate that the majority of components and materials used in products to be developed by us will be readily available. However, there is no assurance that the current availability of these materials will continue in the future, or if available, will be procurable at favorable prices.
Environmental Regulation
 
We have no significant costs associated with compliance with environmental regulations. However, there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in the future.
Major Customers
 
No customers exceeded 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable at December 31, 2018, but two customers exceeded 10% of the Company’s accounts receivable at December 31, 2017. No customers exceeded 10% of the Company’s sales during the years ended December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017.
