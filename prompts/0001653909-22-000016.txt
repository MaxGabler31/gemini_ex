Item 1. Business
Who We Are
Allbirds is a global lifestyle brand that innovates with naturally derived materials to make better footwear and apparel products in a better way, while treading lighter on our planet. 
We began our journey in 2015 with three fundamental beliefs about the emerging generation of consumers: first, these consumers recognize that climate change is an existential threat to the human race; second, these consumers connect their purchase decisions with their impact on the planet, demanding more from businesses; and third, these consumers do not want to compromise between looking good, feeling good, and doing good. We became a public benefit corporation, or PBC, under Delaware law and earned our B Corporation, or B Corp, certification in 2016, codifying how we take into account the impact our actions have on all of our stakeholders, including the environment, our flock of employees, communities, consumers, and investors. Today, we are a high-growth company with a loyal and expanding customer base that has earned our brand the permission to expand beyond our casual footwear origins and enter adjacent categories such as performance running shoes and apparel. Our strong brand equity is fueled by our differentiated products created by sustainability-driven innovation.
Why We’ve Been Successful So Far
Allbirds has developed five core strengths that have enabled our success and given us a durable, competitive advantage. Using these core strengths outlined below, we created something new: an industry-redefining global lifestyle brand built around sustainability with best-in-class materials innovation capabilities and a unique approach to bringing our products to consumers around the globe.
•Product Innovation Based on Materials Research and Development, or R&D, and Simple, Purposeful Design
Innovation is built into our culture, and our product innovation platform starts with natural materials. With meticulous attention, we have examined every component that goes into our products to ensure we deliver design, comfort, and performance. We have a track record of nature-based innovations, including materials made from wool, tree, sugar cane, crab shells, and more. As we have scaled and built our commercialization capabilities, our innovation has created a virtuous cycle of research and development that translates to partners seeking us out to utilize their novel developments, and allows us to extend our advantage in sourcing and commercializing differentiated materials that reduce our impact on the planet.
With materials at our product platform’s core, we are able to extend into new categories and develop new innovations across the body leveraging our versatile, distinctly simple design, and a focus on performance and comfort. Our emphasis on design that removes unnecessary details to highlight our “Hero” materials allows us to capitalize on existing designs. Between our major materials innovations, we deliver product newness and brand excitement from incremental launches across color, pattern, exclusive partnerships, and additional features.
•Purpose-Driven Lifestyle Brand with an Inspirational Voice
Our brand inspires consumers to live life in better balance, which creates deep affinity and loyalty with our growing base of customers. For our customers, balance is not having to compromise between looking good, feeling good, and doing good for the planet. We spent years developing high-quality products while also pioneering sustainable practices in product development. Our commitment to environmental conservation and sustainability is built into our DNA as both a PBC under Delaware law and a certified B Corp. Through these efforts, we have been able to cultivate an authentic brand supported by a community that loves our products because they fit perfectly into their everyday lives.
•Deep Connection with Our Community of Customers
As a brand with a digitally-led vertical retail distribution strategy, we are able to own the customer experience, which allows us to use data to determine who our customers are, what is important to them, and what products are most relevant and when, allowing us to create a strong connection with our customers. We have learned that our customers live an active and curious lifestyle, care about health and well-being, prioritize quality over price, frequently purchase products online, live in urban center settings, and appreciate socially conscious brands. In 
Table of Contents

addition to communicating more effectively with our customers, these insights allow us to meet customers’ needs through the creation of new products and enhancements to our existing line.
•Global Vertical Retail Distribution Strategy that Melds Digital with Physical
Our digitally-led vertical retail distribution strategy combines our digital offerings with our stores so we can meet consumers where they are, delivering value and convenience. Our direct distribution to customers in 35 countries and across our 35 store locations as of December 31, 2021 enables us to own the customer experience, driving deeper brand engagement and loyalty, and effectively managing inventory, while also realizing better margins. Vertical retail not only allows us to better understand our customers, but also enables us to cut out the layers of costs associated with traditional wholesalers, creating a more efficient cost structure. Ultimately, we believe this provides unmatched value to customers, enabling us to deliver better products and a better experience to customers, one that competitors relying on wholesale distribution cannot afford to deliver at our price point.
•Unique and Agile Infrastructure with Key Investments in Place to Scale
Our vision from day one has been to be a global lifestyle brand that makes and delivers better products in a better way. Through careful investments and strategic partnerships, we have built a robust infrastructure with key investments in place across several functional areas that will enable our company to profitably scale, including supply chain, technology, and localized teams with market expertise.
Why We Will Continue to be Successful
Our intention is to be a high-growth, profitable business that consistently delivers great outcomes for our stakeholders. To do this, we believe it is vital to have a clear long-term growth strategy that translates into near-term growth initiatives.
Our long-term strategy to fulfill this vision has five strategic pillars:
•Make the world’s most comfortable shoes and apparel, powered by world-leading sustainable materials innovation and design;
•Build a global brand that attracts a large, loyal community of customers who love our products;
•Inspire that community of customers to keep coming back and to serve as our biggest advocates;
•Serve that community through a digitally-enabled and seamless cross-channel experience; and
•Deliver the highest quality products on time at a great value to our customers through a low-carbon, technology-enabled, consumer-focused supply chain.
Threading through these five strategic pillars is our commitment to tread lighter and have a positive impact on all stakeholders, including the environment, our flock of employees, communities, consumers, and investors.
In the near term, this strategy will manifest itself in the following five growth initiatives:
Table of Contents

•Innovate and make great new products with natural, sustainable materials in the following ways: introducing new materials, expanding footwear offerings, and broadening our apparel offerings.
•Raise awareness and grow our customer community with thought leadership moments, community, expanding our brand beacon through physical touchpoints, and full-funnel marketing. 
•Deepen engagement with our community of customers with an emphasis on product, personalization, and proximity. 
•Expand vertical retail distribution to meet our customers where they are by increasing our store fleet, growing within our existing international markets, further personalizing and growing our digital channels. 
•Optimize infrastructure for profitable growth with an innovation-focused partner network and technology-led efficiency improvements. 
Commitment to Profitable Growth
Our commitment to tread lighter and have a large positive impact on all of our stakeholders requires financial discipline and a focus on profitable growth. Our expectation is that the combination of our strategy and growth initiatives will result in both topline expansion and operational leverage, leading to a strong margin profile and a robust bottom line. If executed as we anticipate, the impact of the growth drivers should manifest in:
•gross margin improvement due to lower costs related to scale and favorable product, channel, and geographic mixes;
•marketing efficiency improvement, as a percentage of sales, due to favorable channel mix, greater awareness, and less reliance on new customer acquisition as a driver of revenue growth; and 
•operating expense improvement, as a percentage of sales, due to scale and leveraging historical infrastructure investments as we grow.
Our core strengths work in unison to allow us to make better things in a better way, tread lighter, and help our consumers to live life in better balance. Our core strengths also create a competitive moat that sets us apart from competitors. Starting from our materials science innovation and versatile, distinctly simple designs, we have built a powerful product innovation platform that allows us to continue to create new and differentiated products and grow closet share. Our superior products are backed by a global lifestyle brand and a vertical distribution strategy that offer our repeat customers value, convenience, and peace of mind. Underlying our business are our dedicated employees, supply chain capabilities, and technology that allow us to profitably grow our business and have a positive impact on the world.
Our Products
Allbirds started in 2016 with a single offering, the Wool Runner, which TIME Magazine named “The World’s Most Comfortable Shoe.” Since our initial launch, we have methodically built our product development engine through a fully-integrated team across strategy, sustainability, design, sourcing, development, and production, both in our U.S. headquarters and within our manufacturing and supply chain innovation partners, combining to deliver the same product philosophy and design principles that created our iconic Wool Runner: sustainability at the core with distinctly simple design and performance comfort in mind.
Table of Contents

Today, we offer more than 60 products across Footwear and Apparel within our Lifestyle and Perform categories. Each product adheres to our three product design principles, creating an evergreen, fad-resistant product that never goes out of style.
Footwear has historically represented the vast majority of our revenue and has been the foundation of our brand. We think of each new style launch as a franchise where each new design can be leveraged across new materials innovations, colors, partnerships, and adjacent stylings to create freshness for the brand and our customers.
Our unique technical expertise in footwear and materials research and development has provided us consumer credibility for our entry into apparel. Our apparel offerings currently include lifestyle tees, sweatpants, sweatshirts, as well as performance tanks, tees, leggings, and shorts, plus basics including socks and underwear. Our apparel offerings leverage our leading naturally derived materials innovation to re-imagine products in a category that has been historically reliant on synthetics and poor environmentally performing products and supply chains.
Materials and Innovation
Our innovation approach is to leverage materials that are both more sustainable than synthetic alternatives and also have real, tangible performance benefits that can easily be experienced and appreciated by customers, such as comfort, temperature regulation, and odor control. We have developed a unique, systemized approach to using natural materials R&D to create differentiated products that unlock value for our customer and are measurably better for the planet. This authenticity stands in contrast to legacy companies that claim sustainability by inserting a small amount of natural or recycled materials in their products.
Materials research and development is led by our Innovation team, which draws on its deep expertise in biomaterials commercialization and polymer science. Additionally, we collaborate with experts in the fields of biomechanics, polymer development, green chemistry, biotechnology, and sustainable venture investment to extend the innovation ecosystem beyond our employees and supply base. Our process of bringing these materials to market is executed in close coordination with our Product Development team to ensure that products utilizing these novel materials meet or exceed our customers’ 
Table of Contents

quality and performance standards before it is ready for commercialization. In the five years since our initial launch, we have already built a palette of distinctive “Hero” materials platforms that provide the foundation for our product innovation.
Table of Contents

We continuously refine our “Hero” materials to further enhance the customer experience, with each iteration seeking to improve upon the comfort, versatility, and performance of the previous materials.
Marketing Strategy and Brand
From the start, our goal to inspire people to live life in better balance has been central to our marketing. Our customers associate our brand with our mission and sustainability, supported by high-quality product experiences powered by our materials innovation, and our track record of striving to do what is right for all of our stakeholders. As a vertically integrated company that has a direct relationship with our customers, we couple an organic marketing approach with our vast data ecosystem to construct a well-balanced and diversified marketing funnel that consistently drives return on advertising spend that works well for our financial model today and as we scale.
We are focused on increasing brand awareness and consumer touchpoints through the following marketing initiatives: 
•Spreading our message through word-of-mouth, thought leadership and PR, partnerships, and community.
•Extending our reach and connecting with our customers through digital and performance marketing, TV and other media, stores as physical brand beacons, and customer experience.
Digitally-Led Vertical Retail
We reach our customers directly through our digitally-led vertical retail distribution strategy, which combines our digital offerings with our stores so we can meet consumers where they are, delivering value and convenience. Our digital channel includes our website, which supports seven languages and showcases the entire breadth of our product portfolio, the materials that create our portfolio, and our branded content. The seamless online experience from search to order to fulfillment creates the convenient shopping experience that our customers desire. In addition, our digital platform allows us to educate our customers on both our products and our mission, leveraging content from our research on sustainability innovation and our commitment to reversing climate change through better business. Complementary to our online presence, our mobile app allows customers to virtually try on footwear, purchase exclusive product drops, and gain early access to our new product launches, creating further engagement between our brand and our customer. 
As of December 31, 2021, our physical retail channel includes our 35 company-operated stores spread across eight countries and 22 cities and areas. In addition to performing well as standalone entities, our locations serve as brand beacons, increasing brand awareness and site traffic, and driving an overall lift in the business within the regions they operate. Our physical retail channel also enables us to offer cross-platform shopping which fulfills customer needs. Endless aisle allows us to fulfill a customers’ request for items that are not available in store, minimizing lost sales and optimizing a store’s footprint while still being able to provide the full product breadth to our customers.
Technology
Since our inception, we have aspired to leverage modern technology across physical and digital channels. Our current technology infrastructure is nimble and enables us to scale globally at a lower cost than large incumbents. We have married tried-and-true enterprise systems with custom-built technology stacks tailored to our needs. Because we started our business with a modern technology stack, we are able to rely on partners such as Shopify to more effectively scale. We have benefited from investments in digital customer experience, data analytics and science, back office business applications, and data security. We have grown our business with a Cloud-First approach, allowing us to execute and innovate with speed and agility. To create our digital customer experience, we leverage a common core set of APIs and tools that enable localization and speed-to-market. We have a sophisticated data infrastructure and toolset that allows our global teams to make informed decisions across key aspects of the business. Our data is vast and growing rapidly, giving us deeper understanding to continuously optimize our business. This data, coupled with advanced data science and analytics, powers many areas of our business including marketing, customer relationship management, personalization, inventory planning, logistics, and product investment decisions.
We made early investments in back office business applications to scale globally. This enabled us to build reusable technology and business processes such as procure-to-pay and order-to-cash that are leveraged across geographies, allowing us to rapidly grow our global footprint. In 2021, we completed the rollout of new technology that standardizes procure-to-pay and store replenishment business processes across our supply chain. This new technology gives us the 
Table of Contents

ability to track inventory more accurately and efficiently, thereby helping to improve our inventory planning and logistics decisions.
Protecting our customer data, employee data, and intellectual property is a responsibility we take very seriously and is essential to keep the confidence and trust of all our stakeholders. We employ multi-factor authentication, a suite of security tools, systems monitoring and alerting, audit logs, and controls across our major systems, corporate devices, and business processes to protect and secure sensitive data. 
Our Supply Chain and Operations 
Our unique combination of sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution capabilities create a foundation from which we can continue to innovate and scale across the globe. We work hard to keep our relationships with our suppliers robust, respectful, and resilient so that our relatively small supply chain can make a real difference in the drive toward innovation and lighter impact on the environment. Our distribution network, comprised of nine distribution centers across eight countries (the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, China, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand), puts us close to the customer, allowing us to reach 35 countries in a matter of days with quick, reliable service. 
•Responsible sourcing program and small, tight-knight supply chain. Unlike most footwear and apparel brands that pick from a set of predetermined, off-the-shelf materials, we have approached materials sourcing from the fiber and molecular level up, beginning with the farms and a greater focus towards the inputs to the materials we use through our direct supplier relationships. This process generates higher quality inputs, while also providing greater traceability, helping ensure that our supply chain remains aligned with our brand values. Because of the high standards we promise our consumers, we both partner with certification bodies and do our own work to ensure our suppliers are meeting standards for quality, ethical practices, and environmental sustainability. This often means that we develop relationships with producers of base resins for soles, and with the farmers of our base fibers used in both shoes and apparel. For example, we’ve built a deep relationship with the New Zealand Merino Company, or NZM, which has been our wool supplier since the beginning. NZM’s direct sourcing model allows us to develop relationships directly with farmers (who we visit regularly), creating the ability to choose sourcing partners who have aligned values with our brand. We also rely on a carefully selected set of leading standards and certifications such as NZM’s ZQ certified wool (which is the highest standard in sheep welfare) and Forest Stewardship Council, or FSC-certified (which is the world’s leading standard in responsible forest management), fiber, rubber, and paper, which we pull through our supply chain.
•Manufacturing. Due to our thoughtfully-curated product offering, we have carefully selected a tight group of Tier 1 factories as our partners to help us make world-class products, helping to develop the technical expertise needed to work with our sustainable materials via an extensive iteration process. We have established deep long-standing relationships by directly partnering with their development, commercialization, manufacturing, and quality teams from ideation through production, and have embedded our employees within some key factories to oversee the product process. Our relationship-based approach has helped us be nimble and drive flexibility and agility to react to changes in macroeconomic conditions, customer demand, or internal priorities, as evident during the COVID-19 pandemic when we experienced minimal disruptions to our manufacturing effectiveness across our entire factory base.
We require that all partners sign our Supplier Code of Conduct, or Supplier Code, which requires that suppliers operate in full compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of the countries in which they operate. Our Supplier Code goes further, drawing upon ILO Core Labor Standards, in order to advance social and environmental responsibility. We also expect supplier factories to undertake an onsite social assessment by an independent, third-party social assessment firm. These social assessments ensure suppliers meet our minimum expectations with regards to working conditions as specified in our Supplier Code. In addition to conducting our own audits when necessary, we accept third-party, mutually recognized standards to reduce audit fatigue at factories and ensure safe, lawful, humane, and ethical manufacturing practices.
Our footwear products are primarily manufactured in Korea and Vietnam across four vendors, with the ability to scale up manufacturing in China as a potential alternative. Our apparel and other non-footwear products are primarily manufactured in Vietnam and Peru, with China, the United States, and Indonesia supporting a smaller subset across six vendors.
•Logistics and distribution. From the beginning, we prioritized the customer experience by establishing distribution centers in all of our key markets. We have nine distribution centers in eight countries, giving us the ability to reach 
Table of Contents

35 countries. Each region has its own distribution center to manage pick, pack, and ship activities, including retail fulfillment and returns management. We rely solely on third-party logistics providers for these distribution centers, as well as last-mile carriers to distribute finished products from our warehouse locations to our stores and individual orders directly to consumers. Our U.S. business is serviced through two different locations in Kentucky and California that enable digital click-to-home of three to five business days on average while minimizing transportation cost and carbon impact. Having two distribution centers in the United States allows us to reduce shipping distance, costs, delivery, and our carbon footprint. Our entire supply chain has been carbon neutral since 2019. In almost all of our major markets, we directly interface with major parcel and freight carriers to drive cost and process efficiencies.
Competition
The market in which we primarily operate in is highly competitive. Our competitors include athletic and leisure footwear companies, and athletic and leisure apparel companies. While this market is highly fragmented, many of our competitors are larger, with strong worldwide brand recognition, and have substantially greater resources than us. In addition, access to offshore manufacturing and the growth of digital have made it easier for new companies to enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition in the footwear and apparel industry.
We believe we are well-positioned to compete in this industry given our unique combination of innovative materials and products, purpose-driven lifestyle brand, deep connection with our community of customers, global vertical retail distribution offering, and infrastructure ready for scale.
Public Benefit Corporation Status
As a demonstration of our long-term commitment to environmental conservation, our board of directors and stockholders elected in February 2016 to amend our certificate of incorporation to become a PBC under Delaware law. Under Delaware law, a PBC is required to identify in its certificate of incorporation the public benefit or benefits it will promote and its directors have a duty to manage the affairs of the corporation in a manner that balances the pecuniary interests of the corporation’s stockholders, the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation’s conduct, and the specific public benefit or public benefits identified in the corporation’s certificate of incorporation. A PBC is also required to assess its benefit performance internally and to disclose to its stockholders at least biennially a report detailing the corporation’s success in meeting its public benefit objectives.
As provided in our certificate of incorporation, the public benefit that we promote, and pursuant to which we manage our company, is environmental conservation. 
Certified B Corporation
While not required by Delaware law or our PBC status, we have elected to have our social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency assessed against the proprietary criteria established by B Lab, Inc., or B Lab, an independent non-profit organization. We were first designated as a B Corp in 2016. The term “B Corp” does not refer to a particular form of legal entity, but instead refers to a company that has been certified as meeting the social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency standards set by B Lab.
In order to be designated as a B Corp, companies are required to undertake a comprehensive and objective assessment of their positive impact on society and the environment. The assessment evaluates how a company’s operations and business model impacts its workers, customers, suppliers, community, and the environment using a 200-point scale. While the assessment varies depending on a company’s size (number of employees), sector, and location, representative indicators in the assessment include payment above a living wage, employee benefits, stakeholder engagement, supporting underserved suppliers, and environmental benefits from a company’s products or services. After completing the assessment, B Lab will evaluate the company’s score to determine if it meets the requirements for certification using a process described on B Lab’s website. Historically, the median score for companies evaluated by B Lab has been 50.9, compared to our latest recertification score of 89.4 in 2019/2020, which increased from our initial score of 81.9 in 2016 despite the growing size and complexity of our business during those years. Our next B Lab recertification will occur at the end of 2022.
Acceptance as a B Corp and continued certification is at the sole discretion of B Lab. To maintain our certification, we are required to update our assessment and provide documentation supporting our updated score with B Lab every three years. To maintain our status as a B Corp, we will need to update our current certification no later than January 2023.

Environmental, Social, and Governance
Environmental
Our intention is to help reverse climate change through better business. We believe that climate change is an existential threat and the number one issue facing humanity and the global economy. Climate change is a complex issue that can be summarized simply: the climate is changing because humans are releasing too many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. According to a 2020 McKinsey and Global Fashion Agenda report, the global fashion industry accounted for approximately 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, or 2.1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, or CO2e, and over 70% of those emissions were related to upstream activities like materials production, preparation, and processing. The 2015 Paris Agreement set the goal to limit global warming to well below 2° Celsius, preferably to 1.5° Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. Under its current trajectory, the fashion industry is expected to fall short of meeting the 1.5° Celsius target by 50%, according to a 2020 McKinsey and Global Fashion Agenda report. The pace of change must accelerate in order for the industry to be compatible with planetary boundaries, and Allbirds offers a blueprint for how to get there. Our approach to addressing the climate impact of our business is scientific and data driven—we first measure, then reduce, and finally offset the entirety of our emissions.
Measure
Allbirds measures CO2e produced in making our products and running our business—because you can’t reduce what you don’t measure. The information we gather not only informs product design and development, but enables us to identify hotspots in our value chain with the highest emissions and prioritize efforts in areas we can have the most impact.
We use a Life Cycle Assessment, or LCA, methodology to measure the emissions created across the lifetime of our products, including raw materials production, manufacturing, transportation, product use, and end of life. Our LCA methodology has been built in partnership with external experts, and has been third-party verified to meet ISO 14067 standards, the international standard for quantifying, monitoring, reporting, and validating greenhouse gas emissions.
In 2020, we began labeling each of our products with its carbon footprint. We did this for two reasons: to hold ourselves accountable to reducing our impact over time, and to help our customers develop a sense for the climate impact of the things they buy. According to a survey we conducted of 1,300 U.S. customers in 2020, 92% of our customers trust us to deliver reliable information, tools, and advice around sustainability. We empower people to make better decisions for the planet by providing them with objective and quantitative information about the impact of the product they’re buying. 
Our goal is to inspire other brands to follow suit, so that one day customers can compare carbon footprints of products just like they compare nutrition labels on food. This would create a productive “race to the top” where brands compete to have the lowest carbon footprint products. In service of this future, we have published our LCA methodology, detailed methodology, and our labeling system for anyone to download and implement in their own business, and have specifically shared these resources with the 15 largest fashion brands to invite them along on our journey. Several large companies have announced commitments to label products with carbon footprints, and we’re eager for more organizations to do the same. 
Reduce
By using natural, renewable materials in place of petroleum-based synthetics and responsible manufacturing practices, Allbirds produces footwear today with approximately 30% less emissions than our estimated carbon footprint for a standard sneaker. If we assume all 24 billion pairs of shoes produced by the industry in 2019 had a 30% lower carbon footprint relative to our estimate of the carbon footprint of a standard sneaker, the industry would have saved 98 million tonnes of CO2e, which is equivalent to taking 21 million cars off the road in the same timeframe. Using our product carbon footprint methodology, our internal estimates are that we reduced the weighted average carbon footprint of our top 10 products in 2021 by approximately 13.8%, as compared to 2020. In 2021, we teamed up with adidas to create a pair of performance running shoes with a carbon footprint of 2.94kg of CO2e—about ¼ the carbon footprint of standard sneakers.
We are able to produce lower-impact products because sustainability is a key design principle woven throughout the product development process, not an add-on at the end. At the very beginning of the product creation process, we integrate key sustainability constraints like target carbon footprint and preferred materials composition in addition to standard practices like establishing target profit margins. Our Sustainability Team also ensures that sustainability is considered at every key milestone of creating a product. We believe that great products must be sustainable, which does not require a compromise between looking good, feeling good, and doing good.

To continue to lead the industry, and to build a business that is compatible with less than 1.5° Celsius warming, we have an ambitious plan to dramatically reduce the per unit carbon footprint for each of our products by 50% by the end of 2025 and by 95% by 2030, in each case, relative to a baseline of what our average carbon emissions would be per unit in 2025 without any further action to limit emissions. Our plan to help reverse climate change has three strategic priorities: Regenerative Agriculture, Renewable Materials, and Responsible Energy. These initiatives are underpinned by five foundational areas: Fair Labor, Water, Chemistry, Animal Welfare, and Traceability and Transparency. These priorities have been defined through a materiality process informed by input from various stakeholder groups including employees, investors, customers, and suppliers.
Within our three priorities, we have outlined ten measurable commitments that collectively can yield a 50% reduction in the per unit carbon footprint for each of our products by the end of 2025, relative to what our average carbon emissions would be per unit in 2025 without any further action to limit emissions. Our strategy is aligned to the United Nations’ 
Table of Contents

Sustainable Development Goals, including affordable and clean energy, responsible consumption and production, climate action, and life on land, among others.
We believe that near term goals and progress must be coupled with long term ambition. We have outlined an extension of our 2025 goals to align with the scientific community’s focus on achieving significant climate progress by 2030. To that end we established a target to achieve a 95% reduction in our per unit carbon footprint by 2030, relative to a baseline of what our average carbon emissions would be per unit in 2025 without any further action to limit emissions. This is equivalent to a 44% reduction (or a 42% reduction excluding product use) in our absolute carbon footprint against a 2020 baseline across Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, despite ambitious growth goals for units sold. Our target has been externally validated as compliant with all the requirements of the Science Based Targets initiative, or SBTi, including a path to a 1.5° Celsius reduction, and we received formal validation by the SBTi in 2021.
Our sustainability plan is not just better for the planet; it is better for our business. We have conducted a rigorous feasibility assessment for each of our targets, including the investment required. We have targets to reduce raw materials use by 25%, relative to a baseline of what our average materials use would be per unit in 2025 without any further action to limit emissions, and to achieve a steady state of greater than 95% of shipments by ocean freight. We expect that these two targets would both reduce costs and positively impact gross margin such that we can achieve all of our targets at a cost 
Table of Contents

savings to the business. By proactively creating a climate-resilient business, we believe we are well-positioned to profitably grow and lead a new age of sustainable manufacturing.
Offset
While we’ve been a carbon neutral business through the use of offsets since 2019, our ultimate goal is to reach net zero carbon emissions across our entire footprint (Scopes 1, 2, and 3) by 2030—meaning on average our products have a carbon footprint of less than one kg of CO2e, before offsetting the rest. To do that, we are building the cost of carbon emissions into our business by implementing an internal carbon tax across all of our sourcing and business decisions today. Offsets are only a credible tool if you also have a robust plan to reduce emissions. We are taking steps, through regenerative agriculture, materials innovation, and clean energy, to reduce emissions within our direct footprint and within our supply chain. For those emissions that we are not able to abate today, we have invested in high quality carbon offset projects, and have purchased renewable electricity, to neutralize our remaining emissions. Allbirds has been a carbon-neutral business on an annual basis across Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions since 2019.
We know all carbon offsets are not created equal, so we work with trusted partners to source projects we believe in. All of our offset projects must be certified to an internationally recognized offset standard such as Gold Standard and Verified Carbon Standard, and are screened against criteria like permanence, additionality, leakage, and vintage year. Finally, our calculations and offset purchases are reviewed by Climate Neutral, a non-profit organization of which we are a founding member that helps brands decrease their emissions, in order to achieve Climate Neutral certification.
Social
People (Our Flock)
Our thriving culture and talented employees, also known as our “flock,” have been a critical factor in our success to date and will be critical to our success in the future. Further, as a PBC, employees are an important stakeholder in our business as are the communities that extend beyond our walls.
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 710 ’birds, 514 of whom were located in the United States. 258 of our ’birds work in one of our corporate offices, 410 work in retail, and 32 work in customer experience. We also hire seasonal employees in retail and customer experience, primarily during the peak holiday selling season. None of our employees are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment. In certain countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements, which include works councils and industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
•Culture and Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging
We are committed to diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging and believe our success as a company is dependent upon our ability to integrate tangible, measurable practices to ensure all voices are heard. We have seven employee resource groups, or ERGs, supporting various communities, including Women, LGBTQ+, AAPI, Black, Latinx, parents/caregivers, and international inclusion. These ERGs encourage employees to come together and support our business and each other through programming, education, and community engagement. We track and measure our diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging progress and representation quarterly. As of December 31, 2021, people of color and women made up 48% and 53%, respectively, of our U.S. workforce.
•Global Talent Development and Engagement
We enable the flock to operate at their highest potential by building critical skills and leadership capabilities across all levels. We train our global retail and customer support teams to deliver incredible customer experiences and drive sales, while maintaining our vision globally and localizing content through collaborative review processes.
As Allbirds scales to a global organization, we have implemented critical organizational structures and managerial capabilities, including building an executive leadership team with deep expertise across retail, consumer, and eCommerce, and intentionally implementing a structure appropriate for our scale. We conduct bi-annual surveys to collect feedback and understand employee sentiment and engagement, and host inclusive leadership training sessions.

•Our Response to COVID
Since March 2020, we have been closely monitoring the volatile COVID-19 landscape, with the health and safety of our flock top of mind. We acted swiftly in response to the crisis by temporarily closing most of our facilities, including the majority of our stores, and worked to implement various pay protection frameworks for retail employees.
We also offer a variety of resources to support our flock’s emotional and physical well-being during the pandemic, including helpful internal tools and resources, free access to telehealth therapists, and a wellness program with a variety of virtual classes. We will continue to prioritize the safety of our flock through the pandemic and are closely monitoring the situation in every market which we serve. We will temporarily close stores and restrict operations as necessary, based upon information from government and health officials.
•Total Rewards
Our total rewards strategy is designed to encourage employees to live our values while helping us to achieve company sustainability goals. For example, we provide our full-time employees with 16 hours of paid time off each year specifically for volunteer activities performed during working hours, as well as charitable donation matching up to $500 per year. Furthermore, our executive compensation for director level and above is explicitly tied to a target reduction in company-wide emissions. 
Our Customers
For too long the footwear and apparel industry has offered customers a false trade-off between sustainable products and great products. We offer great products that are also sustainable, and make it easy for our customers to understand the impact of the products they buy through our carbon footprint labels. In this way, as well as through our generous 30-day return policy, we believe we empower our customers to make purchasing decisions that make sense to them. We designed our vertical retail business strategy in order to provide more value to customers and to make our products more accessible, removing the cost, friction, and barriers of wholesale distribution. 
Our Community
A core tenet of our B Corp status is supporting the communities in which we operate. We are always looking for opportunities to uplift local communities where we are uniquely suited to lend a helping hand. To name a few examples:
•Allgood Collective. The Allgood Collective is a growing global community of individuals who promote the power of collective action as a force for good and who act as brand ambassadors for us. As of December 31, 2021, we had over 177 ambassadors who were part of our Allgood Collective. We offer our social media platforms to amplify their work and our retail spaces as community hubs.
•Soles4Souls. Our generous 30-day return policy means that a lot of gently worn shoes get sent back to us. When shoes are returned to Allbirds, those that can’t go back onto the shelf are donated to Soles4Souls. Soles4Souls works with partner organizations in developing countries. Since our first sale in 2016, we have donated more than 267,000 pairs of shoes to Soles4Souls.
•Pensole. In 2021, we teamed up with Pensole Academy, a footwear design academy, to launch the Better Responsible Design Program, an eight week online course that challenges aspiring product designers to redefine the category of sustainable footwear. At the end of the course, we selected two students for a fully paid internship at Allbirds.
•Fam 1st Family Foundation. In 2021, we partnered with Marshawn Lynch, a Bay Area native and former NFL player, and EARTHseed Farm, a 14-acre solar-powered organic farm in Sonoma County, California, to promote environmental education and expand access to nature for Bay Area youth. As part of this partnership, we donated $50,000 to the Fam 1st Family Foundation, an Oakland, California-based nonprofit founded by Mr. Lynch. The organization is dedicated to empowering underserved youth and fostering a new generation of innovative thinkers, leaders, and problem solvers.

Governance
In addition to our status as a PBC and certification as a B Corp, we also focus on the following areas of governance:
Oversight and Our Board of Directors
We regularly require that ESG issues are represented at the highest level of decision making (including through a Head of Sustainability). We have a gender-diverse board of directors, with 38% of our directors identifying as women. Management reports on ESG issues to our board of directors on a quarterly basis. The sustainability, nomination, and governance committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing ESG matters.
Sustainability Advisory Committee
In 2021, we formally established a Sustainability Advisory Committee composed of external and independent third-party ESG experts. The committee is co-chaired by our Head of Sustainability and aims to advise management on ESG strategy and reporting. 
Dual Class Common Stock Structure
Since the beginning of our history, our founders have been singularly focused on building a sustainable business that demonstrates profitable growth because it is sustainable. This is also true for the stockholders who have partnered with us since the early stages of our journey. We have prioritized protecting the ability of our founders and our early financial partners to continue driving toward that vision by implementing a dual class common stock structure that is designed to allow for a thoughtful calibration of long-term objectives with short-term demands.
ESG Reporting
In accordance with our PBC status, we publish a biennial report to stockholders that assesses our progress towards our stated public benefit of environmental conservation and general PBC objectives. In 2021, we made this report publicly available on our website. Before publication, each report is reviewed by a cross-functional group of internal stakeholders including Legal, Finance, Marketing, and Employee Experience with final signoff from our Co-Chief Executive Officers. We have worked with external experts to align our ESG reporting with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure frameworks, which are included below in the sections titled “Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Disclosures” and “The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures”.
SPO Framework
The SPO framework1 laid out in our final prospectus filed with the SEC on November 4, 2021 pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) is a set of ESG criteria that we call the Sustainability Principles and Objectives Framework, or the SPO Framework. The SPO Framework is designed to ensure that Allbirds takes into consideration positive ESG outcomes, as well as the need to mitigate negative ESG factors, and is committed to meeting a high standard of ESG criteria across its business. 
We believe that stakeholders will benefit from knowing that we have been assessed by one or more independent third parties as having satisfied objective, clearly defined ESG criteria and that we are committed to meeting high ESG standards across our business. We also believe we are leading by example through our commitment to establishing a rigorous, objective, and clearly defined SPO Framework and holding ourselves accountable to meeting those criteria. Finally, we believe the establishment and public disclosure of our SPO Framework will help investors better understand and assess our commitment to sustainability and positive outcomes for all stakeholders.
Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating
We believe it is important to seek external evaluation of the work we are doing to validate progress and identify areas for improvement. In a world where climate change is an existential threat, supply chains are increasingly complex, and 
1 The Sustainability Principles and Objectives Framework, or the SPO Framework, is a new and untested framework, which was not developed solely by disinterested third parties but rather was developed with input from Allbirds and other partners. There is no basis for investors to, or track record by which investors can, assess the impact of the SPO Framework on our operations, financial condition, and the market price of our Class A common stock. The SPO Framework was created in conjunction with, and supported by, an Advisory Council coordinated by BSR, a global non-profit business network focused on sustainability, and consisting of two individuals employed by Allbirds, two individuals employed by one of our stockholders, Baillie Gifford, which is a beneficial owner of less than two percent of our outstanding shares of capital stock, and several cross-sector thought-leaders, market participants, and stakeholders from the private and public sectors.

human capital management is more important than ever, it is important for Allbirds to analyze and manage ESG risks to our business. In 2021, we engaged Sustainalytics, a globally recognized independent ESG assessment provider, to perform a broad-based Corporate ESG Assessment of Allbirds covering seven distinct ESG categories, including Human Capital, Supply Chain, Resource Use, Emission & Waste, and Corporate Governance. Sustainalytics assessed us as having an overall indicative Corporate ESG Assessment score of 14.7, which places Allbirds in the “low risk” category as of August 2021. Our indicative score would place us in both the top 10% of Footwear companies assessed by Sustainalytics and in the top 10% of all companies assessed by Sustainalytics2.
Sustainability Accounting Standards Disclosures
The mission of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB, is to develop sustainability metrics for public corporations to disclose material, decision-useful information to investors. Our disclosures are designed to provide comparable and consistent data. We have included metrics from the SASB’s Consumer Goods Sector – Apparel, Accessories and Footwear industry standard and Consumer Goods Sector – ECommerce industry standard that are relevant to our business below. Although we include all the disclosures for the SASB Apparel, Accessories, and Footwear industry standard, our primary standard, in the tables below, we do not currently satisfy all of the requirements for that standard. In addition, we have included select disclosures from the SASB eCommerce industry standard in the tables below that we believe are relevant for our business. We will continue to build out our disclosures in alignment with these standards over time.

Strategic approach to managing environmental and social risks that arise from sourcing priority raw materials, and approach to managing risks associated with the use of raw materials in products, including physical limits on availability, access, price, and reputational risks | Allbirds relies on stringent material certifications to be sure we are buying high quality, natural materials. We work to trace our primary natural materials all the way back to the source, and certifications are an important part of ensuring that responsible practices are in place throughout our supply chain. In 2021, our main raw material certifications were ZQ for Wool and FSC for Tree-based products (TENCEL™ Lyocell, natural rubber, packaging). As we incorporate more natural materials into our products, we will continue to seek out the most stringent certifications available. Our 2025 Flight Plan goals include continuing to replace petroleum-based materials with natural ones such that 75% of our materials are sustainably sourced natural or recycled, reducing the carbon footprint of key raw materials by 25%, and reducing raw material use by 25% across footwear & apparel products. We calculate the carbon footprint of each of our products including emissions from materials, manufacturing, transportation, product use, and end of life using our LCA tool. We have published detailed information about our LCA tool on our website. | CG-AA-440a.1.
Priority raw materials that comprise products and the method of identifying priority raw materials | In 2021, the top raw materials in our products, by weight, were wool, TENCEL™ Lyocell (tree-based fiber), recycled polyester, and SweetFoam®, our midsole blend that is made with ethylene-vinyl acetate, or EVA, and sugarcane-based Green EVA.

Product Packaging & Distribution 
Management Approach 
Strategies to reduce the environmental impact of fulfillment and delivery of products, including impacts associated with packaging materials and those associated with product transportation including logistics selection, packaging choices, fuel and vehicle choices, route efficiency, etc. | We strive to minimize packaging and source packaging materials with the lowest environmental impact possible, while meeting functional requirements and delivering a best-in-class customer experience. We prioritize packaging that is made from traceable recycled materials that can be recycled at end of life. Practically, this means using FSC-certified recycled cardboard, printing with soy-based inks, limiting adhesives to enable recycling, and avoiding single-use polybags or bioplastics. During 2021, 100% of our packaging was made from recycled/renewable materials and 100% of our packaging was recyclable, renewable, or compostable, by weight.Moreover, we prioritize ocean transportation whenever possible.

We are developing a more robust testing program to coincide with our chemicals management program, which we plan to roll out to both Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers by 2025. | CG-AA-250a.2 
Labor Conditions in the Supply Chain 
Management Approach 
Standards to which labor code of conduct compliance is measured | We are committed to ensuring that working conditions in our supply chain are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that manufacturing processes are environmentally responsible. We require our suppliers to implement our Supplier Code of Conduct, which includes, but is not limited to, Occupational Health and Safety, Freely Chosen Employment, No Child Labor, Harassment or Abuse, No Discrimination, Freedom of Association, Working Hours, Wages and Benefits, Environmental Practices, and Animal Welfare. Allbirds adheres to recognized standards built from local law and internally accepted norms, including guidance from the International Labor Organization, to help ensure safe, lawful, humane, and ethical manufacturing practices. | CG-AA-430b.1 
Publicly available policy ensuring freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining | Our Supplier Code of Conduct stipulates that suppliers shall recognize and respect the right of workers to form and join trade unions and other worker organizations and participate in collective bargaining without fear of harassment, interference, or retaliation. Suppliers shall also develop effective, respectful, and transparent grievance mechanisms to resolve disputes and complaints, and ensure effective communication between employees, employee representatives, and management. | 
Measures to ensure freedom of association and facilitate collective bargaining (i.e., communication of rights, grievance procedures) | Allbirds’ initiatives include ensuring workers in our supply chain have channels to voice concerns, suggestions, or advocate for their rights through Worker Voice programs. We are aiming for 100% of our Tier 1 factory workers to have access to Worker Voice programs by the end of 2025.Our grievance procedures for employees in our flock include formalized feedback and complaint mechanisms beyond direct reporting lines (including reporting directly to Employee Experience, Legal or anonymously through a whistleblower hotline) to address concerns and improve our company practices. |

Additional context around supply chain auditing, including Audit methodologies and criteria (e.g., management system investigation, worker interviews, management interviews, document review, visual observations), efforts to increase transparency, etc. | We only source from a select number of Tier 1 suppliers that commit to protecting the rights of workers and the environment by signing our Supplier Code of Conduct. We also expect full transparency of our partners’ own supply chains and sub-suppliers.Before a factory is approved to produce for Allbirds, it must pass a social and environmental audit as part of its evaluation. To assess factories’ compliance with our Responsible Sourcing expectations, we use independent, third-party, expert auditors. These audits, which may or may not be announced, include confidential worker interviews, review of documentation and records, and visual inspection of safety conditions. Audits are conducted against international labor standards and local law. Where there are discrepancies between the two, the more stringent requirement will be applied. Audit cadence is determined based on risk level from identified in previous audits.In the middle of 2021, we updated our audit scoring system so that we could better track factory performance to enable future reporting. Audits are scored and factories are rated as Green (Low Risk), Yellow (Medium Risk), Red (High Risk), or ZT (Zero Tolerance), based on the highest risk level of non-compliance found in the audit. A passing audit is either Green or Yellow. Factories rated as Red or ZT after the initial audit will not be approved. Key metrics including risks identified and remediation efforts are expected to be published annually, once we have a full year of audit data.Allbirds believes in continuous improvement and will partner with the factory to develop a Corrective Action plan, based on the audit findings. We require our suppliers to follow-up and improve upon any identified deficiencies in a realistic but timely manner, emphasizing root-cause-analysis and effective management to ensure long-term performance and accountability. Whenever Allbirds starts working with a new factory, the factory will undergo the Allbirds Responsible Sourcing Audit. Once a compliance level is established, we will accept mutual recognition programs in order to reduce audit fatigue and collaborate with other brands. | CG-AA-430b.2.
Quantitative Metrics 
Percentage of (1) Tier 1 supplier facilities and (2) supplier facilities beyond Tier 1 that have been audited to a labor code of conduct, (3) percentage of total audits conducted by a third-party auditor | As of January 31, 2022, 100% of Tier 1 supplier facilities, by facility count, had social audits completed by a third-party in the previous 12 months. Two of our Tier 1 supplier facility audits were postponed from December 2021 to January 2022 due to COVID-related auditor availability. 100% of these audits were conducted by a third-party auditor. We are not yet able to report on labor code of conduct audits for suppliers beyond Tier 1, but plan to expand our audit program to all strategic Tier 2 suppliers by the end of 2025. | CG-AA-430b.1

We are also obligated to report to our stockholders every two years on our progress as a PBC. In 2021, we published our 2020 Sustainability Report, which fulfils the requirements of the Public Benefit Report, on our website, making it available to all stakeholders. Certified B Corp Status In addition to our PBC status, we have also achieved B Corp certification since 2016. Every three years, we must recertify through a process and set of expectations that have become more rigorous over time. According to B Lab, the median score of all businesses that have completed the B Impact Assessment is 50.9; our latest recertification score was 89.4 in 2019, up from our initial (2016) score of 81.9. Executive Compensation Management and employees at or above the Director level are incentivized, in part, through our bonus program, where bonuses are linked to sustainability outcomes, including specific metrics related to carbon reduction targets. Oversight and our Board of Directors We regularly require that ESG issues are represented at the highest level of decision making (including through our Head of Sustainability). Management reports on ESG issues to our board of directors on a quarterly basis. The Sustainability, Nomination, and Governance Committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing ESG matters. We have a gender diverse board, with 38% of our directors identifying as women. Sustainability Advisory Committee In 2021, we developed an external Sustainability Advisory Committee to provide an additional review of our sustainability strategy, progress, and insights into potential business risks and opportunities. |

Discussion of measures that have been implemented to increase customer awareness on sustainability impacts of products during their life cycle and to help customers reduce the environmental footprint of products | We understand the value customers place on authenticity and transparency, and since our inception, have run extensive campaigns to educate consumers about the sustainability impacts of footwear and apparel in general, and how we are working to address those impacts through our manufacturing processes and our products themselves. We share information on the social and environmental attributes of our products in our stores, in our social media channels, on our website, and in our Sustainability Report. Examples of Allbirds marketing campaigns with a sustainability focus include labeling all products with their carbon footprint and freethefootprint.com.In 2020, we began labelling all of our products with their carbon footprint. We did this for two reasons: to hold ourselves accountable to reducing our impact over time and to help our customers make informed purchasing decisions with climate impacts in mind. Providing a product’s planetary cost front and center empowers people to make intentional choices.According to a survey we conducted of 1,300 U.S. customers in 2020, 92% of our customers trust us to deliver reliable information, tools, and advice around sustainability. | CG-EC-230a.2.

The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures
The Financial Stability Board established the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD, which is committed to market transparency and stability, to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures. Allbirds supports the mission of the TCFD to improve and increase reporting of climate-related financial information. We believe our initial TCFD climate-related financial disclosures align with the TCFD recommendations, and we intend to continue to refine our strategy and reporting in this framework going forward. In the table below, we look at existing governance structures and strategy that fit within the TCFD framework, what was done in the year ended December 31, 2021, and indicate our aspirations for the future to make this disclosure more robust. TCFD provides a framework with four thematic areas—Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets—and 11 recommended disclosures. The following table provides information intended to address each recommendation.

a.Describe the board’s oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities. | Our board of directors considers sustainability risks and opportunities as part of its overall strategic decision-making process through review and approval of our annual operating plan and our sustainability strategy. Our Sustainability, Nomination, and Governance Committee has oversight of ESG topics; both the committee and the full board of directors receive quarterly reports from management on significant sustainability actions, goals, and progress.Annually, the board of directors reviews and approves our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which includes disclosures regarding climate-related risks and opportunities. 
b. Describe management’s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. | In 2021, we developed an external Sustainability Advisory Committee to provide a review of our sustainability strategy, progress, and insights into potential business risks and opportunities. The Sustainability Advisory Committee is composed of external ESG leaders who bring diverse experience and industry expertise. Management meets with the Sustainability Advisory Committee regularly to update and align on climate-related risks and opportunities.Our sustainability strategy, or the Allbirds Flight Plan, centers on three strategic priorities: Regenerative Agriculture, Renewable Materials, and Responsible Energy, which are underpinned by ten specific, quantitative targets. These climate-related strategic priorities are operationalized through our Sustainability team, which is led by our Head of Sustainability. These strategic priorities have oversight from our Chief Operating Officer who reports directly to our co-CEO. Executive bonuses are linked to sustainability outcomes, including specific metrics related to carbon reduction targets.Our Sustainability team collaborates on an ongoing basis with cross-functional teams to monitor climate-related issues, and promote sustainability initiatives across our value chain, including product development, supply chain sourcing, and broader business operations, and reporting through a consolidated sustainability scorecard that is shared with our board of directors and management on a quarterly basis. At the end of each fiscal year, the Sustainability team also engages with each business area to collect specific data to prepare the greenhouse gas inventory analysis. This process includes cross-functional and leadership reviews, as well as third-party verification of the data.

Strategy: Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy, and financial planning.
a.Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term. | According to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures’ 2020 Status Report, when companies choose to disclose on TCFD, only 7% globally fully disclose on the strategy pillar. Allbirds decided to pursue an analysis of climate-related risks in our strategy and our approach to risk management.In 2021, management began the process of identifying, assessing, and quantifying Allbirds’ climate-related transition and physical risks, as well as corresponding opportunities, through a hot spot analysis. This assessment was supported by Anthesis, a global sustainability consulting leader, to help us better understand our risk exposure, create a roadmap for scenario analysis and resiliency planning, develop strategies for leveraging opportunities, and meet our reporting and disclosure commitments.The first step in our climate-risk and opportunity analysis was to conduct climate risk and opportunity workshops with key business areas, including Sustainability & Innovation, Supply Chain, Product Development, Legal, Finance, Workplace, Marketing, Technology, and Retail. These workshops were intended to 1) identify a preliminary list of potential climate-related business risks and opportunities; 2) understand the potential scale of such risk or opportunity should it occur; and 3) identify substantive social, regional, or financial risk and opportunity thresholds that would designate a risk or opportunity as material to our business.Once we had a preliminary list of risks and opportunities, we identified the anticipated effect (the impact that a risk or opportunity will have on that key business area) and vulnerability (any management plans we have to mitigate against those risks or capitalize on those opportunities) to understand the potential scale. The exercise analyzed both effect and vulnerability of transition and physical risks across the short- (five years), medium- (ten years), and long-term (30 years). At the conclusion of these workshops, we evaluated the effect and vulnerability of each physical and transition risk associated with climate change, which informs the list of risks and opportunities provided below.The following risks have been identified through the workshops with the key business areas but have not been assessed for their materiality to our business. This will be completed through the upcoming scenario analyses.RISKSTransition - the risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy over the next decade:•Pricing on greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions•Energy and fuel price increasePhysical - the chronic and acute risks associated with the physical impacts of a changing climate may affect Allbirds’ ability to source natural materials and move them through a global supply chain. These physical climate risks include:•Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events including extreme precipitation and drought •Increased mean temperatures including extreme heat and cooling degree days•Wildfires brought on by droughts and extreme temperature•Rising sea levels•Changes in precipitation patterns

 | OPPORTUNITIES:Efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change also present opportunities for our business:•Energy Sources: Conventional fuel prices are projected to increase. Our goal is to use 100% renewable electricity to manufacture all Allbirds products at owned and operated facilities and finished goods manufacturers by the end of 2025. By procuring renewable energy, Allbirds will help mitigate additional costs to our business, helping preserve our competitive pricing structure. •Products & Services: We believe Allbirds’ corporate mission and increasingly sustainable products provide a competitive position within the landscape of shifting consumer preferences for environmentally and socially responsible products. •Resource Efficiency: Partnerships with manufacturing facilities on environmental initiatives may decrease costs. This could improve energy efficiency and indoor air quality, as well as improve employee attraction and retention through a commitment to sustainability and better working conditions. •Resilience: Allbirds has developed tools and strategies to quantify and manage emissions, which will help to respond to climate change. 
b. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning. | To support our bold ambition on climate change, our sustainability strategy, or the Allbirds Flight Plan, centers on three strategic priorities: Regenerative Agriculture, Renewable Materials, and Responsible Energy, which are underpinned by ten specific, quantitative targets. With these targets, we set a goal to cut our carbon emissions per unit of product produced in half by the end of 2025, relative to a baseline of what we expect our per-unit carbon emissions would be in 2025 without any further action to limit emissions. We will continue to be a carbon neutral business, as we have been since 2019 through the use of offsets.We believe in the importance of demonstrating near-term progress and laying out a clear path to achieve our goals. We expect that achieving these ten targets as a whole ultimately improves gross margin and business resiliency. 
c. Describe the potential impacts of different scenarios, including a 2°C scenario, on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning. | In 2021, we conducted a hotspot mapping exercise to prioritize our key climate-related risks and opportunities. Building off this exercise, we plan to conduct scenario analyses of the key transition and physical risks and opportunities. The analysis will quantify the financial implications associated with these climate-related risks and opportunities, enable us to gather the quantitative information necessary to assess our adaptive capacity, and further invest in opportunities to enhance resilience across our value chain.

Risk Management Disclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks. 
a.Describe the organization’s processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks. | Our Sustainability team collaborates on an ongoing basis with cross-functional teams to monitor climate-related issues, and promote sustainability initiatives across our value chain, including product development, supply chain sourcing, and broader business operations, reporting through a consolidated sustainability scorecard that is shared with our board of directors and management quarterly.Additional enterprise risk functions include climate-related risks as part of their analysis, which is presented to the Audit Committee of our board of directors and management annually.Allbirds evaluates climate risks based on their likelihood, significance, and scope of impact across the business. The 2021 climate risk and opportunity identification workshops also established the key business areas’ substantive risk thresholds. Revenue, cost, and adjusted EBITDA are metrics used by the key business areas to evaluate climate-related risks. Aggregating these data points allows Allbirds to establish company-wide substantive risk thresholds. These established substantive risk thresholds will serve as a basis for us to identify future climate-related risks posed to our operations. Allbirds will use these established thresholds to evaluate climate risks annually at a minimum, and more often as needed.
b. Describe the organization’s processes for managing climate-related risks. | Our Head of Sustainability and other subject-matter experts actively engage with Allbirds’ key business areas to manage climate risks and opportunities on an ongoing basis.We categorize risks according to four distinct management methods, based on enterprise risk management methodology: avoid, reduce, share, and accept. For example, we manage risks using the ‘reduce’ method through our strategic vendor partnerships, based on our partners’ willingness to implement and uphold best practices, decreasing the inherent vulnerability associated with vendor-based manufacturing. Once we identify a best practice for mitigating climate risk through vendor management, we proactively update our existing vendor agreements to align with improved internal standards. 
c. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organization’s overall risk management. | As part of our standard Enterprise Risk Management, or ERM, process, our cross-functional risk management team evaluates enterprise risks based on their likelihood, significance, and scope of impact across the business, including climate-related risks. The four climate risk management methods outlined above reflect the same methodology used to manage all enterprise-wide risks. Risks are evaluated at least annually and reported to management and the board of directors. Substantive risk findings from our climate risk identification and assessment process and scenario analysis established by the Sustainability team in 2021 will be integrated into our company-wide risk management process moving forward. 
Metrics & Targets Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities. 
a.Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process. | In 2020, we began the annual practice of measuring our carbon footprint across Scope 1, 2, and 3 categories, as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. This includes calculating the carbon footprints for all products produced in a given year. We have adopted an internal price on carbon to incentivize emissions reductions. We use the proceeds from this internal tax to purchase renewable energy credits and high-quality carbon offsets against our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. As a result, we are Climate Neutral certified. All carbon offset projects are third-party verified to the highest standards, such as Gold Standard, Verified Carbon Standard, or Climate Action Reserve.

b. Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2 and if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions and the related risks. | Since 2020, we have focused on calculating and disclosing the carbon footprint of each of our products, working with a LCA tool to estimate the cradle-to-grave carbon footprint of products, identify hotspots, and drive emission reductions. This LCA tool was developed by our Sustainability team in partnership with external LCA experts and has been third-party verified against the requirements of ISO 14067:2018. It enables our teams to make informed decisions in design and development, tracking both product-level and company-wide carbon impact. As a result, in April 2020, we published the carbon footprint for every product in our permanent collection.In 2021, we disclosed the absolute emissions across our direct and indirect operations for 2020, following the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, with additional third-party verification by SCS Global Services. Scope 1 and 2 emissions are driven by retail stores and corporate offices, and the majority of our Scope 3 emissions are from the materials, manufacturing, and transportation associated with our products.2020 Estimates of Allbirds’ Market-based Emissions (tonnes CO2e)a.Scope 1: 223b.Scope 2: 588c.Scope 3: 37,629We are currently in the process of a third-party verification for our 2021 Scope 1,2, and 3 emissions and we plan to disclose our 2021 emissions once the verification is complete. 
c. Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets. | The Allbirds Flight Plan centers on three strategic priorities: Regenerative Agriculture, Renewable Materials, and Responsible Energy, which are underpinned by ten specific, quantitative targets. The Allbirds Flight Plan drives our targets for climate-related risk mitigation.By the end of 2025, we aim to reduce our per-unit emissions by 50% relative to a baseline of what we expect our per-unit carbon emissions would be in 2025 without any further action to limit emissions, driving our average carbon emissions to around 7 kg CO2e per product. We aim to achieve this by sourcing zero carbon wool, replacing petroleum-based materials with natural ones, and using less and cleaner fuel and electricity. Specifically, our goal is that 75% of our materials will be sustainably sourced natural or recycled materials, and we are committed to reducing raw materials use and the impact of key raw materials by 25% across footwear and apparel products. In addition, our goal is to source 100% renewable electricity for all owned and operated facilities, including offices, retail stores, and distribution centers, as well as finished goods manufacturers, by the end of 2025. We are committed to achieve a steady state of more than 95% ocean shipping, reducing the amount of higher emission modes of transport, like air shipping. We also aim to encourage our customers to machine wash our products on cold and hang-dry Allbirds apparel. By 2030, we aim to reduce our per-unit emissions by 95%, driving our carbon emissions to less than 1 kg CO₂e per product. This ambitious goal is necessary to reduce our absolute carbon emissions in alignment with a science-based 1.5°C reduction pathway. We have set a science-based target to reduce absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions 42% by 2030 from a 2020 baseline. Our target is aligned with all the requirements of The Science Based Targets initiative, or SBTi, including alignment with a 1.5°C reduction pathway, and was approved by SBTi in 2021.
