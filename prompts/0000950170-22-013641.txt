We, together with our unconsolidated affiliates, operate 76 manufacturing facilities in 21 states and 10 countries. Twenty-eight of these facilities are operated by our wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiaries. The remaining 48 facilities are operated by our consolidated (15) and unconsolidated joint ventures (33).

Our operations are managed principally on a products and services basis and are comprised of four primary operating segments which correspond with our reportable business segments: “Steel Processing,” “Consumer Products,” “Building Products,” and “Sustainable Energy Solutions.”

We hold equity positions in nine joint ventures, which are further discussed in the Joint Ventures section below. Of these, Spartan Steel Coating, L.L.C. (“Spartan”), TWB, Worthington Samuel Coil Processing LLC ("Samuel") and WSP are consolidated with their operating results reported within Steel Processing.
 
During fiscal 2022, Steel Processing, Consumer Products, Building Products and Sustainable Energy Solutions served approximately 1,300, 1,700, 1,600, and 500 customers, respectively, located primarily in the United States and Europe. International operations accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated net sales during fiscal 2022 and were comprised primarily of sales to customers in Europe. Sales to one customer in the automotive industry accounted for 13% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022.

Refer to the following segment descriptions and “Note P – Segment Data” for a full description of our reportable business segments.
 
Steel Processing
 
Steel Processing is a value-added processor of carbon flat-rolled steel, a producer of laser welded solutions, and provider of electrical steel laminations. The segment includes our four consolidated joint ventures, Samuel, Spartan, TWB, and WSP. For fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, the percentage of our consolidated net sales generated by Steel Processing was approximately 75.0%, 64.9% and 60.8%, respectively.
    Steel Processing is one of the largest independent intermediate processors of flat-rolled steel in the U.S. It occupies a niche in the steel industry by focusing on products requiring exact specifications. These products cannot typically be supplied as efficiently by steel mills to the end-users of these products.
 
Steel Processing, including Spartan, TWB, Samuel, and WSP, operates 29 manufacturing facilities located in Ohio (9), Michigan (5), Tennessee (2), Kentucky (2), Indiana (1), Illinois (1), New York (1), Canada (2), China (1), India (1) and Mexico (4).

Steel Processing serviced approximately 1,300 customers during fiscal 2022 in many end markets including automotive, aerospace, agricultural, appliance, construction, container, energy, hardware, heavy-truck, HVAC, lawn and garden, leisure and recreation, office furniture, and office equipment. The automotive industry is one of the largest consumers of flat-rolled steel, and thus the largest end market for Steel Processing. For fiscal 2022, Steel Processing’s top three customers represented approximately 27% of the operating segment’s total net sales.
 


Steel Processing buys coils of steel from integrated steel mills and mini-mills and processes them to the precise type, thickness, length, width, shape and surface quality required by customer specifications. Computer-aided processing capabilities include, among others:
 •aluminum die casting, which injects molten aluminum into electrical motor components to improve motor efficiency;
 •progressive stamping and notching, a process used to convert steel coils into electrical motor laminates;
 •transformer core winding and blank sheet stacking, processes used to convert steel coils into electrical transformer cores;
 •cold reducing, which achieves close tolerances of thickness;
 •configured blanking, which mechanically stamps steel into specific shapes;
 •coil fed laser blanking, which uses lasers to cut coils of steel, aluminum and other metals into specific shapes;
 •cutting-to-length, which cuts coils into sheets of exact length;
 •dry-lube, the process of coating steel with a dry, soap-based lubricant;
 •hot dip coating, which coats steel with either zinc, zinc alloy or aluminum and silicon through a hot dip process;
 •annealing, a thermal process that changes the hardness and certain metallurgical characteristics of steel;
 •laser welding, which joins steel or aluminum blanks with different thicknesses, coatings or material strength;
 •pickling, a chemical process using an acidic solution to remove surface oxide which develops on hot-rolled steel;
 •slitting, which cuts steel coils or steel sheets to specific widths;
 •oscillate slitting, a slitting process that spools together several narrow coils welded end-to-end into one larger coil;
 •temper rolling, which is the process of light cold-rolling steel;
 •tension leveling, a method of applying pressure to achieve precise flatness tolerances; and
 •non-metallic coating, including acrylic and paint coating.
 


Steel Processing also toll processes steel for steel mills, large end-users, service centers and other processors. Toll processing is different from typical steel processing in that the mill, end-user or other party retains title to the steel and has the responsibility for selling the end product. Toll processing allows us to earn a fee for services without incurring inventory costs while enhancing Steel Processing's participation in the market for wide sheet steel and large standard orders, a market generally served by steel mills rather than by intermediate steel processors.

The steel processing industry is fragmented and highly competitive. There are many competitors, including other independent intermediate processors. Competition is primarily on the basis of price, product quality and the ability to meet delivery requirements. Technical service and support for material testing and customer-specific applications enhance the quality of products (see the Technical Services section below). However, the extent to which technical service and support capability has improved Steel Processing’s competitive position has not been quantified. Steel Processing’s ability to meet tight delivery schedules is, in part, based on the proximity of our facilities to customers, suppliers and one another. The extent to which plant location has impacted Steel Processing’s competitive position has not been quantified. Processed steel products are priced competitively, primarily based on market factors, including, among other things, market pricing, the cost and availability of raw materials, transportation and shipping costs, and overall economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad.
 
Consumer Products
 
Consumer Products consists of products in the tools, outdoor living and celebrations end markets sold under market-leading brands that include Coleman® (licensed), Bernzomatic®, Balloon Time®, Mag-Torch®, General®, Garden-Weasel®, Pactool International®, Hawkeye, Worthington Pro Grade and Level5®. These include propane-filled cylinders for torches, camping stoves and other applications, LPG cylinders, handheld torches, helium-filled balloon kits, specialized hand tools and instruments, and drywall tools and accessories sold primarily to mass merchandisers, retailers and distributors. LPG cylinders, which hold fuel for barbeque grills and recreational vehicle equipment, are also sold through cylinder exchangers.

Consumer Products generated approximately 12.1%, 16.5% and 14.7% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. Consumer Products serviced approximately 1,700 customers during fiscal 2022. Sales to the top customer represented approximately 22% of net sales for Consumer Products during fiscal 2022.

Consumer Products operates five manufacturing facilities located in Kansas (2), New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin.

We use the registered trademark Balloon Time® to market helium-filled balloon kits; the registered trademark Bernzomatic® to market certain fuel cylinders and handheld torches; the trademark Worthington Pro Grade to market certain LPG cylinders, hand torches and camping fuel cylinders; the licensed registered trademark Coleman® to market certain camping fuel cylinders; the registered trademark Mag-Torch® to market certain handheld torches; the registered trademarks General®, Garden-Weasel®, Pactool International® and Level5® to market certain tools.
 
Each registered trademark has an original duration of 10 to 20 years, depending on the date it was registered and the country in which it is registered, and is subject to an indefinite number of renewals for a like period upon continued use and appropriate application. We intend to continue using the trade names and trademarks described above and to timely renew each of our registered trademarks that remains in use.
 
Building Products
 
Building Products sells refrigerant and LPG cylinders, well water and expansion tanks, and other specialty products, which are generally sold to gas producers, and distributors. Refrigerant gas cylinders are used to hold refrigerant gases for commercial, residential, and automotive air conditioning and refrigeration systems. LPG cylinders hold fuel for residential and light commercial heating systems, industrial forklifts and commercial/residential cooking (the latter, generally outside North America). Well water tanks and expansion tanks are used in the residential market with the latter also sold into commercial markets. Specialty products include a variety of fire suppression and chemical tanks.

Building Products generated approximately 10.3%, 12.7% and 12.5% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. Building Products serviced approximately 1,600 customers during fiscal 2022.
   Building Products operates six manufacturing facilities located in Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio (2), Rhode Island, and Portugal.



For sales in the U.S. and Canada, cylinders are primarily manufactured in accordance with U.S. Department of Transportation and Transport Canada specifications. Outside the U.S. and Canada, cylinders are manufactured according to European norm specifications, as well as various other international standards. Other products are produced to applicable industry standards including, as applicable, those standards issued by the American Petroleum Institute, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and UL Solutions.
    Building Products has one principal domestic competitor in the low-pressure LPG cylinder market, and there are a number of foreign competitors in both of the LPG cylinder and the non-refillable refrigerant markets. We believe that this business has the largest market share in the domestic low-pressure cylinder market. In the other cylinder markets, there are several competitors. Building Products is a leading supplier to the European market for low-pressure non-refillable cylinders. Building Products generally has a strong competitive position for its industrial, energy, retail and specialty products, but competition varies on a product-by-product basis. As with our other operating segments, competition is based upon price, service and quality.

Sustainable Energy Solutions
 
Sustainable Energy Solutions, includes onboard fueling systems and services, as well as gas containment solutions and services for storage, transport and distribution of industrial gases operated out of three manufacturing facilities located in Austria, Germany, and Poland. It includes high pressure and acetylene cylinders for life support systems and alternative fuel cylinders used to hold CNG and hydrogen for automobiles, buses, and light-duty trucks.

 Sustainable Energy Solutions generated approximately 2.5%, 4.3% and 4.0% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. Sustainable Energy Solutions serviced approximately 500 customers during fiscal 2022.

Other consists of divested businesses historically reported within our legacy Pressure Cylinders segment but no longer included in our management structure and are presented within the “Other” category, on a historical basis, through the date of disposal. For the periods presented, these include the following: Structural Composites Industries, LLC ("SCI") (until March 2021); Oil & Gas Equipment (until January 2021); and Cryogenic Storage and Cryo-Science (until October 2020). The Other category also includes the results of our former Engineered Cabs operating segment, on a historical basis, through the date of disposition (November 1, 2019) as well as certain income and expense items not allocated to our operating segments.
Segment Financial Data
 
Financial information for the reportable business segments is provided in “Note P – Segment Data”.

Suppliers

The primary raw material we purchase is steel. We purchase steel in large quantities at regular intervals from major primary producers of steel, both domestic and foreign. The amount purchased from any particular supplier varies from year to year depending on a number of factors including market conditions, then current relationships and prices and terms offered. In nearly all market conditions, steel is available from a number of suppliers and generally any supplier relationship or contract can and has been replaced with little or no significant interruption to our business. During fiscal 2022, we purchased approximately 2.66 million tons of steel (66.9% hot-rolled, 19.3% cold-rolled and 13.8% galvanized) on a consolidated basis.

 Steel is primarily purchased and processed by Steel Processing based on specific customer orders, while Consumer Products, Building Products, and Sustainable Energy Solutions purchase steel to meet production schedules. For certain raw materials, for example, helium and zinc, there are limited suppliers and our purchases are generally at market prices. Since there are a limited number of suppliers in the helium and zinc markets, if delivery from a major supplier is disrupted due to a force majeure type occurrence, it may be difficult to obtain an alternative supply. Raw materials are generally purchased in the open market on a negotiated spot-market basis at prevailing market prices. Supply contracts are also entered into, some of which have fixed pricing and some of which are indexed (monthly or quarterly). During fiscal 2022, we purchased steel from the following major suppliers, in alphabetical order: Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.; NLMK USA; North Star BlueScope Steel, LLC; Nucor Corporation; Steel Dynamics, Inc.; and United States Steel Corporation (“U.S. Steel”). Major suppliers of aluminum in fiscal 2022 were, in alphabetical order: Arconic Inc.; Horizon; Meyer Aluminum; Norsk Hydro; Novelis Corporation; and Penn Aluminum International. Major suppliers of zinc to Steel Processing in fiscal 2022 were, in alphabetical order: Considar Metal Marketing Inc. (a/k/a HudBay); Glencore Ltd; Teck Resources Limited; and Trafigura Trading LLC. Approximately 45.51 million pounds of zinc and 3.57 million pounds of aluminum were purchased in fiscal 2022. We believe our supplier relationships are generally favorable.

Technical Services

We employ a staff of engineers and other technical personnel, and we maintain fully-equipped laboratories to support operations. These facilities enable verification, analysis and documentation of the physical, chemical, metallurgical and mechanical properties of raw materials and products. Technical Service personnel also work in conjunction with the sales force to specify components and materials required to fulfill customer needs. Laboratory facilities also perform metallurgical and chemical testing as dictated by International Organization for Standardization (ISO), ASTM International, and other customer and industry specific requirements.
Seasonality and Backlog
 
Demand for most of our products remained strong throughout fiscal 2022, but sales are generally strongest in our fiscal fourth quarter as our businesses are generally operating at seasonal peaks. Historically, sales have generally been weaker in our fiscal third quarter, primarily due to reduced seasonal activity in the building and construction industry, as well as customer plant shutdowns due to holidays, particularly in the automotive industry. We do not believe backlog is a significant indicator of our business.
Joint Ventures
 
As part of our strategy to selectively develop new products, markets and technological capabilities and to expand our international presence, while mitigating the risks and costs associated with those activities, as of May 31, 2022, we participated in four consolidated and five unconsolidated joint ventures.

Government Regulations
 
Our manufacturing facilities, generally in common with those of similar industries making similar products, are subject to many federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to the protection of our employees and the environment. We examine ways to improve safety, reduce emissions and waste, and decrease costs related to compliance with environmental and other government regulations. The cost of compliance or capital expenditures for environmental control facilities necessary to meet regulatory requirements are not anticipated to be material when compared with our overall costs and capital expenditures and, accordingly, are not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or the competitive position.
Human Capital Management
 
Culture
 
In line with our people-first philosophy, our employees have always been, and will always be, our most important asset. We operate under a set of core values that are rooted in our long-standing philosophy, which emphasizes the Golden Rule. These core values guide us as a company, including in our approach to human capital management. As such, we are continually focused on creating and maintaining a strong culture. Our culture provides employees with opportunities for personal and professional development, as well as community engagement, all of which we believe contribute to our overall success. We have repeatedly been recognized as a top place to work and we offer our employees competitive pay and above-market benefits, as compared to others in our industry, all while focusing on safety, wellness, and promoting a diverse and inclusive culture.
Employee Base
 
As of May 31, 2022, we had approximately 8,400 employees and our unconsolidated joint ventures employed approximately 3,000 additional employees. Approximately 15% of the employees who make up our consolidated labor force are represented by collective bargaining units. We believe that our open-door policy has created an environment which fosters open communication and serves to cultivate the good relationships we have with our employees, including those covered by collective bargaining units, which is evidenced by the results of recent employee engagement surveys. For example, in the spring of 2022, 63% of our employees participated in an engagement survey, and the results exceeded both manufacturing and global benchmarks in a number of categories, such as employee engagement (75%), safety (89%), and manager effectiveness (76%).
Safety, Health and Wellness
 
We have always made the safety and well-being of our people a top priority, and we have regularly maintained an industry-leading safety record. For us, safety is about engagement, and our employees have adopted a culture where safety is everyone’s responsibility, and not just the safety of our employees, but the safety of everyone who enters our facilities. We also provide our employees and their families with access to above-market benefits, as compared to others in our industry, including a parental leave benefit that offers all new parents the opportunity for paid time off. We have a broad array of other employee centered-benefits and programs, including a medical center, a pharmacy, chiropractic care, on-site fitness centers, free health screenings, health fairs, and other company-wide and location-specific wellness events and challenges. We believe our investments in safety, health and wellness are key to supporting and protecting our most important asset, our people.
Diversity, Inclusion and Equity
 
We believe that diversity, of all types, contributes to our success. We are committed to increasing the diversity of our employee base at all levels of our organization because we believe our differences make us better and that diverse thoughts and experiences drive innovation and produce better results. With our philosophy as our foundation, we are building an environment where diversity is valued, and where all employees feel they belong and are empowered to do their best work.

To further such efforts, we have hired a Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and established a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council (the “Council”) chaired by our Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer. The Council has developed a strategy where our diversity, inclusion and equity efforts are focused on strengthening four primary pillars: workforce, workplace, community and partnership. These pillars serve as a foundation for continually building and fostering an inclusive culture. We have also established certain employee resource groups (“ERGs”) that each have executive sponsors, and are working to establish additional ERGs. These ERGs are not only being tasked with raising awareness, but also with offering mentoring and development opportunities to their members.
 


Talent Development and Retention
 
 Our ability to successfully operate, grow our business and implement our business strategies is largely dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain talented personnel at all levels of our organization. As a result, we offer our employees competitive compensation and benefits, as compared to others in our industry, which include opportunities to participate in profit sharing plans. We also strive to provide our employees with continuous opportunities to learn the skills necessary to maximize their performance, and develop new skills that allow them to maximize their potential.
