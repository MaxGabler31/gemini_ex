ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

OVERVIEW
We are a global provider of trading services and solutions, specializing in over-the-counter, or OTC, and exchange-traded markets. Our retail and futures segments service customers in more than 180 countries worldwide, and we conduct business from our offices in Bedminster, New Jersey; New York, New York; Chicago, Illinois; Powell, Ohio; London, England; Tokyo, Japan; Sydney, Australia; Shanghai, China; Hong Kong; Dubai, U.A.E.; Krakow, Poland and Singapore.
We have invested considerable resources since our inception to develop our proprietary trading platforms to provide our customers with advanced price discovery, trade execution and order management functions, while improving our ability to acquire and service our customers efficiently, as well as manage market and credit risk associated with our customer’s trading activity. Today our customers can trade through web-based, downloadable and mobile trading platforms and have access to innovative trading tools to assist them with research and analysis, trade execution and account management.
We operate our business in two segments. Through our retail segment, we provide customers around the world access to a diverse range of global financial markets. We offer our customers access to over 15,000 global financial markets, including spot foreign exchange (forex), precious metals trading, as well as contracts for difference (CFDs), which are investment products with returns linked to the performance of underlying assets. We offer CFDs on currencies, commodities, indices, individual equities, cryptocurrencies, bonds, options and interest rate products. In the United Kingdom, we offer spread bets, which are investment products similar to CFDs, but that offer more favorable tax treatment for residents of that country. In addition to these OTC products, our futures segment offers exchange-traded futures and options on futures on more than 30 global exchanges. Each of our operating segments is discussed in more detail below. For financial information regarding our segments, please refer to Note 23 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
As a global provider of online trading services, our results of operations are impacted by a number of external factors, including market volatility, competition, the regulatory environment in the various jurisdictions and markets in which we operate and the financial condition of the retail customers to whom we provide our services. These are not the only factors impacting our results of operations for the most recent fiscal period, and additional factors may impact our results of operations in future periods. In addition, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of other factors that may impact our business.
The following table sets forth the key financial data and operating metrics for our business:

Growth Strategies
We intend to grow our business and increase our profitability principally by employing the following strategies:


• | Pursuing organic growth by:


• | Leveraging our global footprint and powerful brand assets to increase our overall share in the markets we operate;


• | Introducing new, innovative products and services; including upgraded and enhanced trading platforms and decision support tools that enhance the customer experience and improve competitive position;


• | Increasing our marketing investment to drive new account growth and asset gathering; and


• | Optimizing client onboarding to improve acquisition results and return on our marketing investment.


• | Increasing operational excellence by:

5


• | Simplifying our technology “stack”;


• | Seeking to achieve an optimal balance between insourcing versus outsourcing; and


• | Developing regional centers to provide administrative and support functions more efficiently.


• | Reducing revenue volatility through:


• | Reducing the variability between customer transaction revenue (CTR) and reported results;


• | Implementing artificial intelligence driven hedging programs;


• | Decreasing the cost of hedging; and


• | Further optimizing trade flow.


• | We will also continue to selectively review mergers and acquisitions and other inorganic opportunities which complement our organic growth strategy.

Tender Offer
On October 9th, the Company announced that it had commenced a "modified Dutch auction" tender offer to purchase up to $50 million of shares of its common stock, or such lesser number of shares of its common stock as are properly tendered and not properly withdrawn, at a price not less than $7.24 nor greater than $7.94 per share of common stock. On November 9th, the Company accepted for purchase 6,377,551 shares of its common stock at a price of $7.84 per share (reflecting a proration factor of approximately 0.95664), for an aggregate cost of approximately $50 million, excluding fees and expenses relating to the tender offer. At the time these shares represented approximately 14 percent of the shares outstanding.
Sale of GTX ECN Business
On June 29, 2018, we completed the sale of the assets of our GTX ECN business, an institutional platform for trading foreign
exchange, to 360T, a subsidiary of Deutsche Börse AG, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of May 29, 2018 (the “Purchase Agreement”). The Purchase Agreement provides for a cash purchase price for the GTX business of $100 million, less a working capital adjustment, which amounted to a $0.2 million reduction in the purchase price. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties that generally survive until the first anniversary of the closing date. We have also agreed to certain non-competition and non-solicitation obligations relating to the GTX business and its employees that expire on the third anniversary of the closing date. We have continued to provide certain transition services to the buyer following the closing date. The parties have entered into commercial agreements relating to a continued business relationship between GAIN and 360T.
Prior to its sale, we reported the results of our GTX ECN business as part of our institutional segment. We have determined
that the institutional reportable segment met the discontinued operations criteria set forth in ASC Subtopic 205-20-45,
Presentation of Financial Statements, in the quarter ended June 30, 2018. As such, the institutional segment results have been
classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Comprehensive Income. For more information relating to the discontinued operations of our GTX ECN business, please see
Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements elsewhere in this report.
Our Retail Segment
Our retail segment represented 83.9% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. We conduct our retail business primarily through our FOREX.com and City Index brands. As of December 31, 2018, we had 155,293 funded retail accounts.
Through our retail segment, we provide customers around the world access to a diverse range of global financial markets. We offer our customers access to over 15,000 global financial markets, including spot foreign exchange (forex), precious metals trading, as well as CFDs, which are investment products with returns linked to the performance of underlying assets. We offer CFDs on currencies, commodities, indices, individual equities, cryptocurrencies, bonds, options and interest rate products. In the United Kingdom, we offer spread bets, which are investment products similar to CFDs, but that offer more favorable tax treatment for residents of that country. We offer these products under the diverse regulatory environments in which we operate. Because of U.S. regulations, neither we, nor our subsidiaries, offer CFDs or spread bets in the United States or to U.S. residents.
We seek to attract and support our customers through direct and indirect channels. Our primary direct channels for our retail segment are our Internet websites, FOREX.com and Cityindex.com, which are available in multiple languages, including 
6

English, Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Our indirect channel includes our relationships with introducing brokers, who solicit customers on our behalf, and white label partners, who offer our trading services to their customers under their own brand. Total retail trading volume sourced through direct and indirect channels was 76% and 24%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.
We generate revenue in our retail segment in two ways: (1) trading revenue from our market making activities for OTC products, earned principally from the bid/offer spread we offer our customers and fees, including financing charges for positions held overnight, commissions on equity CFD trades, and other account related fees and (2) any net gains and losses generated through changes in the market value of the currencies and other products held in our net exposure.
In 2018, we generated approximately 69.2% of our retail segment trading volume from customers outside the United States. For a discussion of the risks associated with our retail segment operations outside the United States, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
The following sections provide additional information regarding our retail business:
Innovative trading tools
We have made significant investment in the development and support of our award-winning proprietary trading technology in order to provide our customers with an enhanced customer experience and multiple ways to trade and manage their accounts, tailored to their level of experience and preferred mode of access. In addition, we selectively offer third party trading tools that we believe complement our proprietary offerings. We believe that our proprietary trading technology has and will continue to provide us with a significant competitive advantage because we have the ability to adapt quickly to our customers’ changing needs, rapidly incorporate new products and features and offer our customers multiple ways to engage with us.
Competitive pricing and fast, accurate trade execution
We have longstanding relationships with a large number of institutional liquidity providers, as well as access to multiple liquidity venues. This allows us to offer our customers superior liquidity and more competitive pricing with tighter bid/offer spreads than many of our competitors. In addition, we have developed a proprietary pricing engine that electronically aggregates quotes from our liquidity sources. This ensures that our prices accurately reflect current market price levels and allows us to provide our customers with fast, accurate trade execution. 
Efficient customer onboarding and account management
We have developed proprietary technology to handle numerous aspects of account onboarding and customer service including account opening and customer verification process, fast online account funding and withdrawals with a wide variety of automated payment methods, and on-demand delivery of customer information, such as account statements and other account-related reporting. We also offer account opening and funding functions on our mobile trading applications in order to provide a superior experience to the large number of customers who trade primarily through their mobile devices. Given the highly regulated and global nature of our business, these processes are customized to each regulatory jurisdiction in which we operate, and are further tailored to customer needs and preferences in specific countries in order to make it easier for clients in these countries to open accounts with us and then to fund and trade in those accounts. 
Sophisticated risk management
Because we are exposed to market, credit and other risks in connection with our retail business, developing and maintaining robust risk management capabilities is a high priority.
We allow our customers to trade notional amounts greater than the funds they have on deposit with us through the use of leverage, making management of credit risk a key focus for us. We manage customer credit risk through a combination of providing trading tools that allow our customers to monitor their risk exposure and avoid taking on excessive risk, as well as automated processes that close customer positions in accordance with our policies, in the event the funds in customers' accounts are not sufficient to hold their positions. One such tool available on our trading platforms is a real-time margin monitoring tool that enables customers to know when they are approaching their margin limits. If a customer's equity falls below the amount required to support one or more positions, automated alerts are sent to make them aware, so they can manage their position.  If the customer's equity falls further beyond their liquidation level, we automatically liquidate positions to bring the customer's account into margin compliance.  If this is necessary, a further automated confirmation is sent to the client to confirm the action taken.
7

In addition, we actively monitor and assess various market factors, including volatility and liquidity, and take steps to address identified risks, such as proactively adjusting required customer margin (both initial and maintenance). 
With respect to market risk, when a retail customer executes a trade with us, the trade may be naturally hedged against an offsetting trade from another customer, hedged through an offsetting trade with one of our liquidity providers or may become part of our net exposure portfolio. For naturally hedged trades, we receive the entire bid/offer spread we offer our customers on the two offsetting transactions. For trades hedged with our liquidity providers, we earn the difference between the retail bid/offer spread we offer our customers and the wholesale bid/offer spread we receive from our liquidity providers. Customer trades in our net exposure portfolio are managed pursuant to our risk-management policies and procedures, including risk limits established by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors, and we receive the net gains or losses generated through the management of our net exposure.
Our risk management policies and procedures have been developed to enable us to effectively manage our exposure to market risk, particularly in connection with the management of our net exposure. Our net exposure is evaluated continuously and is continuously rebalanced in real-time throughout the trading day, thereby minimizing the risk we will be adversely affected by changes in the market prices of the products we hold. This real-time rebalancing of our portfolio enables us to curtail risk in both up and down market scenarios.
Our risk management policies and procedures are established and reviewed regularly by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. Our risk-management team monitors risk exposure continuously and updates senior management both informally over the course of the trading day and formally through real-time, intraday and end-of-day reporting. We do not actively initiate proprietary market positions in anticipation of future movements in the relative prices of the products we offer.
Customers
Our retail customers consist primarily of self-directed traders, who execute trades on their own behalf. A small number of our customers have engaged an intermediary to make trading decisions on their behalf. 
Our typical self-directed customer is generally comfortable making trading decisions and is specifically interested in trading leveraged products, which generally have a higher risk/reward profile. For the year ended December 31, 2018, self-directed customers represented approximately 99.7% of our retail trading volume.
The intermediaries engaged by our managed account customers, which we refer to as authorized traders, include professional money managers, which trade aggregated customer funds, and individuals that trade for a small number of customer accounts. For the year ended December 31, 2018, managed account customers collectively represented approximately 0.3% of our retail trading volume.
Sales and Marketing
In connection with our retail business, we look to acquire new customers as cost-efficiently as possible, primarily through online marketing efforts such as advertising on third-party websites, search engine marketing and affiliate marketing. Our experienced in-house marketing team creates highly targeted online campaigns tailored to experienced traders, as well as marketing programs and materials designed to support and educate newer traders. We use sophisticated tracking and measurement techniques to monitor the results of individual campaigns and continually work to optimize our overall marketing results.
One of our principal lead-generation tools is to offer prospective customers access to free registered practice trading accounts for a 30-day trial period. From a prospective customer’s point of view, we believe the registered practice trading account serves two important functions. First, it allows the prospective customer to evaluate our trading platform, tools and services. Second, for less experienced traders, it serves as an educational tool, providing the prospective customers with the opportunity to try trading in a risk-free environment, without committing any capital. During this trial period, our customer service team is available to assist and educate the prospective customers.
We also work with introducing brokers in order to expand our customer base. We work with a variety of different types of introducing brokers, ranging from small, specialized firms that specifically identify and solicit customers interested in forex and CFD trading, to larger, more established financial services firms. Introducing brokers direct customers to us in return for either a commission on each referred customer’s trading volume or a share of net revenue generated by each referred customer’s trading activity. We also offer a global affiliate program to which third parties refer customers to us in exchange for a one-time payment.

Competition
The market for our retail services is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Our competitors vary by region in terms of regulatory status, breadth of product offering, size and geographic scope of operations. Our main competitors during 2018 can be categorized as follows:

• | Regulated Forex Firms such as OANDA Corporation. For more information, please refer to Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.


• | Global Multi-Asset Trading Firms, including firms such as IG Group Holdings plc, CMC Group and Plus500 Ltd. These firms generally offer a broad set of asset classes and earn a significant percentage of their revenue from CFDs, forex and exchange-traded products.

Our Futures Segment
Our futures segment offers execution and related services for exchange-traded futures and futures options on major U.S. and European exchanges. We clear our customers’ trades through our regulated FCM, GAIN Capital Group, LLC (“GCGL”). In 2014, we expanded our futures business by acquiring a majority interest in Global Asset Advisors, LLC (“GAA”), a Chicago-based futures brokerage firm which principally markets to and services clients under the Daniels Trading (“DTR”) brand. GAA is an introducing broker targeting retail and professional traders, primarily in equities and agricultural products. At the same time, we also acquired a majority interest in Top Third Ag Marketing, LLC (“TT”), an introducing broker, which uses options-based hedging strategies to help clients manage the risks of agricultural production. Pursuant to the exercise of put options set out in the governing documents of GAA and TT, we acquired the remaining minority interest in GAA in September 2018 and the remaining interest in TT as of February 1, 2019. As such, as of the date of this report, both companies are now wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Revenue in our futures segment is primarily generated through commissions earned on futures and futures options trades. Our futures segment represented 11.1% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Advanced Trading Platform
Our futures segment provides customers an enhanced experience through our GAIN Trader proprietary trading platform. We have invested in high-speed connectivity to provide access to over 30 global electronic exchanges, which allows us to deliver streaming quotes and high-speed executions. The GAIN Trader platform has a robust suite of trading tools, including charting tools, custom alerts and indicators, as well as automated trading and risk management tools. Our futures segment also provides Trade Desk Manager, a version of our GAIN Trader platform offered to other introducing brokers, which allows them to manage their customers’ accounts. In addition, we facilitate connection to our trading services through Application Programming Interface (APIs) from other front-end applications, and we license a white label version of our GAIN Trader platform to select third parties.
Risk Management
In our futures segment, we are exposed to credit risk as it relates to customer positions. If an adverse market move occurs and triggers an additional margin requirement, we may be unable to collect the additional margin in a timely manner, or at all. In such a case, we would incur bad debt expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. To mitigate this risk, we monitor all client accounts in near real time using multiple tool and processes designed to ensure that our client accounts are trading within their means.
Sales and Marketing
As with our retail segment, we seek to acquire futures customers as cost-efficiently as possible. Our principal source of new customers comes from a large network of introducing brokers. Furthermore, sales leads are generated through seminars, online advertising and other media. In addition to our marketing efforts, we attract our futures segment customers through dedicated sales staff at GCGL, GAA and TT. These sales teams focus on a variety of sectors and provide differentiated services to our customers. 
Competition
Our futures segment is comprised of both introducing-broker (IB) business as well as direct client offerings that span service level (self-directed to full service).  For our IB business our largest competitors are RJO'Brien and ADM Investor Services and to a lesser extent Rosenthal Collins Group (RCG) and INTL FC Stone.  
9

Our direct full-service business is concentrated in the agricultural hedge sector where we compete with Allendale, Advance Trading and Roach Ag Market as well as a number of boutique smaller rural IBs.  For our self-directed, direct business, we compete with Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, E*Trade Financial Corporation and TradeStation.  All these firms own and operate their own proprietary trading platforms as GAIN does and they offer futures trading as a complement to their core equity trading clientele.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions to protect our proprietary technology, intellectual property rights and our brands (e.g., FOREX.com, GAIN Capital, and City Index). We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants, and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. We rigorously control access to our proprietary technology. Currently, we do not have any pending or issued patents.
We use a variety of service marks that have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including: GAIN Capital (registered service mark), FOREX.com GAIN Capital Group (registered service mark), Forex Insider (registered service mark), ForexTrader (registered service mark), FOREX.com (registered service mark), It’s Your World. Trade It. (registered service mark), GAIN Capital Futures (registered service mark), and GAIN Futures. We also have registered trademarks covering our City Index brand name and logo in a variety of jurisdictions, including Australia, the United Kingdom, European Union, Singapore and China.
Regulation
Overview
Our business and industry are highly regulated. Our operating subsidiaries are regulated in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States, the United Kingdom (through which we have historically accessed regulatory passport rights to operate in a number of European Economic Area jurisdictions), Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Canada, Singapore and the Cayman Islands. Government regulators and self-regulatory organizations oversee the conduct of our business in many ways, and several perform regular examinations to monitor our compliance with applicable statutes, regulations and rules. These statutes, regulations and rules cover all aspects of our business, including:

• | sales and marketing activities, including our interaction with, and solicitation of, customers;


• | trading practices, including the types of products and services we may offer;


• | the methods by which customers can fund accounts with us;


• | treatment of customer assets, including custody, control, safekeeping and, in certain countries, segregation of our customer funds and securities;


• | offer fair and transparent markets including offering symmetrical pricing;


• | maintaining specified minimum amounts of capital and limiting withdrawals of funds from our regulated operating subsidiaries;


• | continuing education requirements for our employees;


• | anti-money laundering practices;


• | recordkeeping and reporting; and


• | supervision regarding the conduct of directors, officers and employees.

In some jurisdictions in which we offer our products and services, we are not subject to regulation as a result of the nature of the market or the manner in which we conduct our business. We consult with legal counsel in jurisdictions in which we operate on a regular basis as to whether we have the required authorizations, licenses or approvals or whether we may conduct our business cross-border with residents in that jurisdiction without obtaining local regulatory authorization, approval or consent. To the extent that we wish to serve customers in a jurisdiction in which we determine licensing or registration is required, we may also elect to direct such customers to a licensed white label or other partner, rather than pursuing licensing or registration ourselves.
Though we conduct our business in a manner which we believe complies with applicable local law, regulators may assert authority over activities that they deem to take place within the jurisdiction they regulate, and new laws, rules or regulations may be enacted that change the regulatory landscape and result in new, or clarify preexisting, registration or licensing requirements.
10

The primary responsibility for ensuring that we maintain compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements is vested in our legal and compliance departments. In addition, our legal and compliance departments are responsible for our ongoing training and education programs, supervision of our personnel required to be licensed by one or more of our regulators, review of sales, marketing and other communications and other related functions. In addition, our sales employees are licensed pursuant to applicable regulation.
U.S. Regulation
In the United States, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association (NFA) regulate our forex and futures trading activities. Historically, the principal legislation covering our U.S. forex business was the Commodity Exchange Act, which provides for federal regulation of all commodities and futures trading activities and requires all futures and commodity options to be traded on organized exchanges. In recent years, as in the case of other companies in the financial services industry, our forex business has been subject to increasing regulatory oversight. The CFTC Reauthorization Act, which grants the CFTC express authority to regulate the retail forex industry includes a series of rules which regulate various aspects of our business, including:

• | creating “retail foreign exchange dealers,” or RFEDs, a regulated category of forex brokers focused on retail investors that are permitted to act as counterparty to retail forex transactions;


• | imposing an initial minimum security deposit amount between 2.0% and 5.0%, depending on the pair, of the notional value for retail forex transactions in “major currency” pairs and between 5.0% and 20.0%, depending on the pair, of the notional value for retail forex transactions in “non-major currency” pairs;


• | providing that introducing brokers, money managers and fund managers must either (i) register with the CFTC and become members of the NFA or apply for an exemption from registration and (ii) meet the minimum net capital requirements applicable to futures and commodity options introducing brokers or enter into a guarantee agreement with a CFTC-regulated forex dealer member and permitting only one such guarantee agreement per introducing broker;


• | requiring that a risk disclosure statement be provided to every retail forex customer, including disclosure of the number of profitable and unprofitable non-discretionary accounts maintained by the forex broker during the four most recent calendar quarters; and


• | prohibiting RFEDs, FCMs and introducing brokers from including statements in sales and marketing materials that would appear to convey to potential retail forex customers that there is a guaranty against loss, and requiring that FCMs, RFEDs and introducing brokers provide retail forex customers with enhanced written disclosure statements that, among other things, inform customers of the risk of loss and in 2018 the NFA imposed additional rule measures including but not limited to:


◦ | requiring swap dealers to file information related swap valuation disputes; and


◦ | additional disclosures and transparency regarding costs per trade; and


◦ | enhancements to the AML program requiring inclusion of FINCEN due diligence requirements; and


◦ | increased margin requirements for Turkish Lira (12%) and South African Rand (7%); and


◦ | requiring additional disclosures to clients for firms offering virtual currencies

In July 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act. A number of significant provisions contained in the law affected our business. Specifically, the Dodd-Frank Act included:

• | rules that, beginning in October 2010, required us to ensure that our customers residing in the United States have accounts open only with our NFA-member operating entity, GCGL; and


• | amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act that, beginning on July 15, 2011, required essentially all retail transactions in any commodity other than foreign currency to be executed on an exchange, rather than OTC.

The Dodd-Frank Act also provides for additional regulation of swaps and security-based swaps, including some types of foreign exchange and metals derivatives in which we engage. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the registration of swap dealers with the CFTC and imposes significant regulatory requirements on swap dealers and swap execution facilities. Effective February 27, 2013, GAIN GTX, LLC became provisionally registered as a swap dealer. During 2016, GTX SEF, LLC became permanently registered as a swap execution facility, although it withdrew its registration with the CFTC as a swap execution facility on December 30, 2018. The CFTC and NFA have adopted, and may adopt, new rules including those more recently adopted requiring RFEDs to provide greater transparency about the cost associated with their forex transactions; required notification to NFA for FCMs that decide to offer customers the ability to trade any virtual currency futures product and 
11

monthly risk data reporting requirements for Swap Dealers. Our operations in the U.S. are also subject to regulatory capital requirements that require various of our subsidiaries to maintain a minimum level of net capital relative to customer obligations. For more information, please see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Regulatory Capital Requirements.”
U.S. Patriot Act and Anti-Money Laundering
Like other companies in the financial services industry, we are subject to a variety of statutory and regulatory requirements concerning our relationships with customers and the review and monitoring of their transactions. Specifically, we are subject to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act, which requires that we maintain a comprehensive anti-money laundering, or AML, program, a customer identification program, or CIP, designate an AML compliance officer, provide specified employee training and conduct an annual independent audit of our AML program. Consistent with the USA PATRIOT Act, our CIP includes both documentary and non-documentary review and analysis of potential customers. Under our CIP, we review each prospective customer’s identity internally and also contract with third-party firms to aid in identity verification and to perform background checks. As part of the background check, all prospective customers are screened against the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets and Control, Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons lists. Our AML Program also includes procedures for verifying beneficial owners and control persons of legal entity customers in accordance with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s Customer Due Diligence Rule, or FinCEN CDD Rule. These procedures and tools, coupled with our periodic training, assist us in complying with the USA PATRIOT Act, as well as the CFTC, NFA, FinCEN, and OFAC applicable AML, CDD and CIP requirements.
United Kingdom Regulation
GAIN Capital U.K., Ltd. (“GCUK”) and Trade Facts, Ltd. (“Trade Facts”) collectively, the (“U.K. Entities”) are registered in the U.K. and are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in respect of their trading activity. These U.K. Entities are required to comply with relevant U.K. and E.U. legislation and regulation. Please see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Regulatory Capital Requirements” for a discussion of minimum regulatory capital requirements applicable to our U.K. businesses.
ESMA Intervention Measures
In March 2018, ESMA announced product intervention measures to further regulate the marketing, distribution or sale of CFDs to retail investors in the European Union. These measures require firms to:

• | implement leverage limits ranging between 30:1 and 2:1 by imposing minimum margin as a percentage of the overall exposure that the CFD provides;


• | close out a customer’s position when their funds fall to 50% of the margin needed to maintain their open positions on their CFD account;


• | provide a negative balance protection that guarantees that a client cannot lose more than the total funds in their CFD account;


• | stop offering monetary and non-monetary inducements to encourage trading;


• | provide a standardised risk warning, which requires firms to tell potential customers the percentage of their retail client accounts that make losses.

While the restrictions on leverage did affect our clients' trading patterns, the Company has taken actions that mitigated the impact of ESMA’s regulations and currently does not expect that the regulations will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.
These measures became effective on August 1, 2018 and have since been extended twice. The expectation is that in time the various EU regulators will introduce similar, permanent measures in their own jurisdictions. Specifically, in December 2018 the FCA released a consultation paper in which it proposed to permanently restrict the sale, marketing and distribution of CFDs to retail customers in the UK. The proposed measures are similar to ESMA’s existing temporary restrictions, but extend the restrictiopns to closely substitutable products, including knock- out products and turbo certificates. 
Furthermore, the FCA has announced that it will release a consultation paper in early 2019 on a potential ban on the sale of CFDs referencing cryptocurrencies to retail consumers. This follows the commitment made in the UK Crypto-asset Taskforce Final Report published in October 2018.

Client Money Rules
GCUK is subject to the FCA’s Client Money rules. Under these rules, we are required to: 

• | maintain adequate segregation of client funds;


• | maintain adequate records in order to identify appropriate client details;


• | have adequate organizational arrangements in place to minimize the risk that client money may be paid for by the account of a client whose money has not yet been received by us;


• | undertake daily internal and external client money reconciliations within an appropriate risk and control framework; and


• | appoint an individual who is responsible for Client Asset Sourcebook, or CASS, oversight.

Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions
As in the U.S., we are subject to statutory and regulatory requirements concerning our relationships with customers and the review and monitoring of their transactions. Specifically, GCUK is subject to ongoing customer due diligence, or CDD, obligations under the Money Laundering Regulations 2017 (MLR), and the FCA Handbook. 
The prescribed CDD measures require the U.K. Entities to (i) verify customer identity and understand the nature and purpose of the proposed relationship on the basis of documents, data or information obtained from a reliable and independent source and (ii) review and monitor their customer’s transactions and activities. The U.K. Entities are required to determine the extent of CDD measures required for each customer on a risk sensitive basis depending on the type of customer, business relationship, product or transaction and we must be able to demonstrate that such measures are appropriate in view of the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. Our procedures are based on the Joint Money Laundering Steering Group’s Guidance for the U.K. Financial Sector, which provides guidance to firms for the determination of appropriate CDD measures. 
The FCA requires the U.K. Entities to have systems and controls in place to enable them to identify, assess, monitor and manage money laundering risk. Accordingly, we have the requisite systems and controls in place which are comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of our activities. We provide appropriate training to our employees in relation to money laundering and retain documentation of our risk management policies and risk profile in relation to money laundering. As required, we provide regular reports to our Money Laundering Reporting Officer, or MLRO, on the operation and effectiveness of these systems and controls, including details of our regular assessments of the adequacy of these systems and controls to ensure their compliance with FCA requirements.
Our systems and controls also include CDD and other measures to identify where customers and others with whom we transact may be subject to financial sanctions, including those initiated or adopted by the U.K. Treasury or the EU. 
EMIR
The E.U. European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Regulation (EU) 648/2012), or EMIR, imposes requirements on entities that enter into any form of derivative contract, including foreign exchange derivatives, and applies directly to firms in the E.U. that trade derivatives and indirectly to non-E.U. firms that trade derivatives with E.U. firms. Accordingly, GCUK needs to:

• | report all derivative contracts and their lifecycle events (concluded, modified and terminated) to which we are a party to a trade repository either by ourselves or through a third party;


• | keep all records relating to concluding of derivative contracts and any subsequent modification for 5 years;


• | comply with the risk management requirements for OTC bilateral derivatives, including portfolio reconciliation, portfolio compression, record keeping, dispute resolution and margining (these requirements began to be phased in starting in September 2016); and


• | clear through central counterparties all OTC derivatives which will be subject to the mandatory clearing obligation.

Appropriateness assessments
Where firms offer “execution only” services for certain financial instruments which are deemed “complex”, E.U. Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Directive 2004/39/EC), or MiFID I, requires firms to assess the appropriateness of those 
13

investments for retail clients. For this assessment, we are required to collect information about our existing and potential clients’ knowledge and experience with regard to specific products and services, including: 

• | the types of services, transactions and financial instruments with which the retail client is familiar;


• | the nature, volume, and frequency of the retail client’s transactions in financial instruments and the period over which they have been carried out; and


• | the level of education, and profession or relevant former profession of the retail client or potential retail client.

We are required to offer to a retail client or transact for them only those products that are deemed appropriate for their knowledge, experience and other circumstances. If the retail client demands a product that has been assessed as inappropriate for the retail client’s circumstances by us, we may either refuse to offer the product to the client or allow them access to the product but we are required to give the retail client a warning that the product may be inappropriate to its circumstances. We are not required to undertake this analysis for professional clients as we are entitled to assume that a professional client has the necessary knowledge and experience in order to understand the risks involved in relation to the particular products or services for which they have been classified as a professional client. 
MiFID II
MiFID I applied in the U.K. from November 2007 but has been recast into a new directive, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (Directive 2014/65/EU), or MiFID II, and a new regulation, the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (Regulation 600/2014), or MiFIR. The changes implemented by MiFID II and MiFIR took effect on January 3, 2018.
MiFID II: 

• | expands the number of financial instruments for which firms are required to carry out an appropriateness assessment before providing an execution only service to retail clients;


• | extends the pre- and post-trade transparency regime to derivatives traded on regulated markets, multi-lateral trading facilities, or MTFs, and organized trading facilities, or OTFs;


• | expands transaction reporting to those financial instruments traded on MTFs, OTFs, and those financial instruments where the underlying instrument is traded on a Trading Venue; and


• | gives E.U. Member State regulators the new power to ban or restrict the marketing, distribution or sale of a financial instrument or types of financial practice where there is a threat to investor protection, the orderly functioning and integrity of markets or to financial stability. The European Banking Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority have similar powers to impose a ban on an EU-wide basis or in relation to a particular E.U. Member State.

Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPs) 
Regulation 1286/486 on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products, or the PRIIPs Regulation, took effect in the U.K. from January 1, 2018, reflecting a delay from the original implementation date of December 31, 2016. U.K. Entities now need to comply with the new regime set out in the PRIIPs Regulation in relation to PRIIPS that they manufacture, advise on or sell to retail clients. The FCA regards derivatives (including options, futures, and contracts for differences) as falling within the definition of a PRIIP. The new regime requires us to provide retail clients with a standardized key information document, or KID, in good time before any transaction in derivatives is concluded or for transactions concluded by distance communications, after the transaction has taken place, but only if it is not possible to provide the KID in advance and the client consents. 
Other International Regulation
