Item 1. BUSINESS.
The following discussion of our business contains various "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events and performance. We caution that although forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs and reasonable judgment based upon current information, these statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including those risks, uncertainties, and factors detailed from time to time in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and in particular those set forth under Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made as of the date hereof or the date specified herein. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.
The Company
Taubman Centers, Inc. (TCO) is a Michigan corporation (incorporated in 1973) that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT). TCO's sole asset is an approximate 71% general partnership interest in The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership (TRG), which owns direct or indirect interests in all of our real estate properties. In this report, the terms "we", "us", and "our" refer to TCO, TRG, and/or TRG's subsidiaries as the context may require. See "Our UPREIT Structure" for additional information about our structure.
We own, lease, acquire, dispose of, develop, expand, and manage shopping centers and interests therein. Our owned portfolio of operating centers as of December 31, 2018 consisted of 23 urban and suburban shopping centers operating in 11 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and China. The Taubman Company LLC (the Manager) provides certain management and administrative services for us and for our U.S. properties. See "Personnel" below for more information about the Manager.
The Consolidated Businesses consist of shopping centers and entities that are controlled, by ownership or contractual agreements, by TRG, the Manager, or Taubman Properties Asia LLC and its subsidiaries (Taubman Asia). Shopping centers owned through joint ventures that are not controlled by us but over which we have significant influence (Unconsolidated Joint Ventures) are accounted for under the equity method. See "Item 2. Properties" for information regarding the shopping centers.
In 2017, the U.S. Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which made significant changes to both corporate and individual tax rates and the resulting calculation of taxes, as well as international tax rules for U.S. domestic corporations. As a REIT, this legislation minimally changed the taxes we pay. However, it could impact the way in which our dividends are taxed on the holders of our stock.
Our UPREIT Structure
We are structured as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, referred to as an UPREIT. In our UPREIT structure, TCO, which is a publicly-traded REIT, is the sole managing general partner of TRG. TCO's sole asset is its ownership of partnership interests in TRG (TRG units), which constitute an approximate 71% economic interest in TRG as of December 31, 2018. The remaining approximate 29% of the TRG units are owned by TRG's partners other than TCO (Other Partners), including Robert S. Taubman, William S. Taubman, Gayle Taubman Kalisman, and the A. Alfred Taubman Restated Revocable Trust (Taubman Family). TRG owns direct or indirect interests in our real estate properties and in the companies that provide management services to us and our real estate properties, including in our Unconsolidated Joint Ventures and the Manager.

The following chart illustrates TCO's and TRG's structure:
Since TCO manages TRG as the sole managing general partner, the Other Partners have limited control rights in TRG in which they hold an economic interest. To provide the Other Partners with voting rights in TCO corresponding with their economic interests in TRG, in 1998, TCO issued, and made available for the Other Partners to purchase, Series B Non-Participating Convertible Preferred Stock (Series B Preferred Shares). The holders of the Series B Preferred Shares vote together with the holders of our common stock on all matters on which the common shareholders vote. Holders of our common stock and the Series B Preferred Shares are each entitled to one vote per share. 
Shares of TCO's common stock are held by TCO's public shareholders and represent, as of December 31, 2018, an approximate 71% voting interest in TCO, which corresponds with TCO's economic ownership of TRG. The Series B Preferred Shares represent, as of December 31, 2018, an approximate 29% voting interest in TCO, which corresponds with the Series B Preferred shareholders’ economic ownership in TRG. As of December 31, 2018, based on information contained in filings made with the SEC by members of the Taubman Family, members of the Taubman Family collectively held 97% of the outstanding Series B Preferred Shares, and collectively held an approximate 30% voting interest in TCO based on their ownership of TCO common stock and Series B Preferred Shares. For further information regarding the control rights of members of the Taubman Family, see “Risk Factors - Members of the Taubman Family have the power to vote a significant number of the shares of Capital Stock entitled to vote and have contractual rights.”
We operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In order to satisfy the provisions of the Code applicable to REITs, we must distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income prior to net capital gains and meet certain other requirements. TRG's partnership agreement provides that TRG will distribute, at a minimum, sufficient amounts to its partners such that our pro rata share will enable us to pay shareholder dividends (including capital gains dividends that may be required upon TRG's sale of an asset) that will satisfy the REIT provisions of the Code.

Recent Developments
For a discussion of business developments that occurred in 2018, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A)."
Business of TCO
We are engaged in the ownership, leasing, acquisition, disposition, development, expansion, and management of shopping centers and interests therein. We owned interests in 23 operating centers as of December 31, 2018. In the following discussion, the term "GLA" refers to gross retail space, including anchors and mall tenant areas, and the term "Mall GLA" refers to gross retail space, excluding anchors. The term "anchor" refers to a department store or other large retail store. The term "mall tenants" refers to stores (other than anchors) that lease space in shopping centers, including temporary tenants and specialty retailers.
As of December 31, 2018, the shopping centers:

• | are strategically located in major metropolitan areas, many in communities that are among the most affluent in the U.S. or Asia, including Denver, Detroit, Honolulu, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York City, Orlando, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, San Juan, Sarasota, Tampa, Washington, D.C., Hanam (South Korea), Xi'an (China), and Zhengzhou (China);


• | range in size between 236,000 and 1.7 million square feet of GLA and between 186,000 and 1.0 million square feet of Mall GLA, with an average of 1.0 million and 0.5 million square feet, respectively. The smallest center has approximately 60 stores, and the largest has over 300 stores with an average of approximately 150 stores per shopping center.


• | have approximately 3,200 stores operated by their mall tenants under approximately 1,700 trade names;


• | have 56 anchors, operating under 17 trade names;


• | lease approximately 90% of Mall GLA to national chains (U.S. centers only), including subsidiaries or divisions of Forever 21 (Forever 21 and XXI Forever), The Gap (Gap, Gap Kids, Baby Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta, and others), H&M, and Limited Brands (Bath & Body Works/White Barn Candle, Pink, Victoria's Secret, and others); and


• | are among the highest quality centers in the U.S. public regional mall industry as measured by our high portfolio average of mall tenants' sales per square foot. In 2018, our mall tenants at comparable centers reported average sales per square foot of $824.

The most important factor affecting the revenues generated by the centers is leasing to mall tenants (including temporary tenants and specialty retailers), which represents approximately 90% of revenues. Anchors account for less than 10% of revenues because many own their stores and, in general, those that lease their stores do so at rates substantially lower than those in effect for mall tenants.
Our portfolio is concentrated in highly productive shopping centers. Of our 23 owned centers, 21 have annualized rent rolls at December 31, 2018 of over $10 million. We believe that this level of productivity is indicative of the centers' strong competitive positions and is, in significant part, attributable to our business strategy and philosophy. We believe that our high-quality shopping centers are the least susceptible to direct competition because, among other reasons, anchors and specialty retail stores do not find it economically attractive to open additional stores in the immediate vicinity of an existing location for fear of competing with themselves. We also believe that our centers' success can be attributed in part to their other characteristics, such as being well-designed with effective layouts, natural light, good physical condition, strong and evolving retail programming, state-of-the-art technology infrastructure, and other amenities. Many of our shopping centers are also strategically located in high-quality markets, with convenient access to a high density of customers, including significant tourist traffic.
 4

Business Strategy and Philosophy
We believe that the shopping center business is not simply a real estate development business, but rather an operating business in which a retailing approach to the ongoing management and leasing of the centers is essential. Thus we:

• | offer retailers a location where they can maximize their profitability. We believe leading retailers and emerging concepts choose to showcase their brand in the best markets and highest quality assets;


• | offer a large, diverse selection of retail stores and dining in each center to give customers a broad selection of consumer goods, food, and entertainment and a variety of price ranges;


• | endeavor to increase overall mall tenants' sales by leasing space to a regularly changing mix of tenants, thereby increasing rents over time;


• | seek to anticipate trends in our industry and emphasize ongoing introductions of new concepts into our centers. Due in part to this strategy, a number of successful retail trade names have opened their first mall stores in our centers. In addition, we have brought to the centers "new to the market" retailers and other retailers that previously served customers through online presences. We believe that the execution of this leasing strategy is an important element in building and maintaining customer loyalty and increasing mall productivity; and


• | provide innovative initiatives, including those that utilize technology and the internet, to increase revenues, enhance the shopping experience, personalize our relationship with shoppers, build customer loyalty, and increase mall tenant sales, with the following as examples:


• | we are continuing to invest in other synergistic digital capabilities and are a developer of the "Smart Mall" concept. Of the 23 shopping centers in our portfolio, 18 are considered to be "Smart Malls." This technology includes a new fiber optic network throughout the centers, free shopper Wi-Fi, navigation and directory technology, advanced energy management, high-speed networking options for our tenants, new digital, mobile shopper engagement, and advanced shopper analytics;


• | our Taubman website program connects shoppers to each of our individual center brands through the internet. In 2018, we launched new mobile responsive websites for all of our centers, emphasizing the imagery of our premier properties and associated offerings;


• | we have a robust email program reaching our most loyal customers weekly and our social media sites offer retailers and customers an immediate geo-targeted communication vehicle;


• | we actively manage a comprehensive social media program at 18 centers, delivering authentic local content which gained over 800 million impressions in 2018;


• | we deploy highly targeted digital media programs that leverage geographic and behavioral targeting to drive incremental visits from local and tourist customers;


• | we have pioneered an indoor navigation technology at many of our centers that has the potential to significantly change a shopper's experience and connect them to retailers in new ways;


• | we have begun installing "smart parking" systems at some of our shopping centers, providing customers real-time information about parking availability, most convenient spots, and directions to their parked cars; and


• | we have implemented rewards, loyalty, VIP, and incentive programs that provide exclusive benefits to designated shoppers leveraging a variety of technologies ranging from dedicated applications for VIPs to customer relationship management database marketing efforts.

 5

For example, as part of Beverly Center’s redevelopment, we implemented the following:

• | free shopper Wi-Fi with analytics capabilities;


• | extensive fiber for future technology needs of the shopper, tenant, and shopping center;


• | a 35-foot-tall, 3-story portrait LED screen with highly immersive artistic and sponsored content;


• | exterior LED lighting system wrapping the entire building that allows the center to celebrate Los Angeles and key events;


• | the latest in digital directory technology, that provides real time map updates, restaurant menus, and interactive routing (in English and Chinese); and


• | a parking system with integration into our website and mobile application that allows consumers to find their car based on license plate recognition.

Our leasing strategy involves assembling a diverse and unique mix of mall tenants in each of the centers in order to attract customers, thereby generating higher sales by mall tenants. High sales by mall tenants make the centers attractive to prospective renewal and new tenants, thereby increasing the rental rates that current and prospective tenants are willing to pay. We have implemented an active leasing strategy to increase the centers' productivity and to set minimum rents at higher levels. Elements of this strategy include renegotiating existing leases and leasing space to prospective tenants that would enhance a center's retail mix. 
The shopping centers compete for retail consumer spending through diverse, in-depth presentations of predominantly fashion merchandise in an environment intended to facilitate customer shopping. Many of our centers include stores that target high-end customers, and such stores may also attract other retailers to come to the center. Each center is always individually merchandised in light of the demographics of its potential customers within convenient driving distance. When necessary, we consider rebranding existing shopping centers in order to maximize customer loyalty, maintain and increase mall tenant sales, and achieve greater profitability.
As our tenant mix continues to evolve to include tenants such as digitally native concepts, luxury, entertainment, restaurants, and fast fashion, increased tenant allowances are being provided to attract the best tenants to our centers. We believe bringing in great retailers will drive traffic and productivity to our centers, enhancing the long-term strategic position of each center.
Recent Trends in Retail
The U.S. shopping center industry has been challenged in recent years and is currently facing choppiness as it continues to evolve rapidly alongside retail. Across the industry, department store sales have weakened and their ability to drive traffic has substantially decreased, resulting in increased store closures, with mature mall tenants and anchors rationalizing square footage and being highly selective in opening new stores. There has been some stabilization of portions of the retail landscape recently, including comparatively strong sales performance during 2018. However, the retail headwinds still have the potential to be prolonged and ultimately may still result in many centers incurring lost or reduced rent, paying higher tenant allowances, and/or experiencing unscheduled terminations. 
The impact of e-commerce on shopping center retail has been steadily increasing. There have been secular changes in shopper behavior affecting how, where, and what consumers shop for. Technology has intervened in the direct relationship between shoppers and the mall by enabling them to research, compare, and purchase products online easily, challenging our unique position as the main shopping portal within a trade area.
 While challenging traditional retail in the shorter-term, e-commerce is also making high-quality brick-and-mortar assets more valuable, as retailers focus their real estate investments on the strongest assets. Successful retailers understand that a combination of both physical and digital channels is likely to best meet their customer needs. Physical locations are an important distribution channel that reduce order fulfillment and customer acquisition costs, while improving website traffic and brand recognition. Physical locations also allow for tenants to most successfully express their full brand statement, creating emotional connections to customers. We strive to position our assets to be desirable platforms for omni-channel retailers, believing technology improves the customer experience and will continue to do so, from the front of the house, logistics, efficiency, pricing, customer acquisition, customer knowledge and service. 
 6

Over time we believe high-quality mall portfolios such as ours will continue to gain market share of mall tenant sales and rents. We expect to achieve this because brick-and-mortar remains the heart of omni-channel retailing. Our high-quality portfolio of shopping centers complements retailers' strategies by positioning their brands among high-end, productive retailers in the best markets. We believe the current environment of significant consolidation of shopping centers will cause high-quality portfolios such as ours to become more valuable, solidifying our position in our current markets, and ultimately leading to greater market share. As an upscale, niche player in our industry, most of our assets have a unique value proposition in their respective markets for tenants and consumers - it's estimated that nearly 80% of our malls are ranked number one or two in their markets based on sales per square foot. They remain critical brick-and-mortar locations for retail brands and important destinations for shoppers. This is a strength of our assets that represents a key advantage against our larger competitors in our industry.
Apparel retailers, traditionally a dominant category for malls, had been facing particularly challenging times in recent years, however there has been recent momentum in the category, and sales have increased in 2018. While it is prudent to continuously adjust the use of space in order to broaden the mall experience, we believe that the rebound of apparel is further evidence that the dramatic reallocation of in-line space to other tenants across the board for the sake of reducing exposure to apparel is neither economically sustainable nor strategically necessary. We continue to expect that additional dining, entertainment, digitally native concepts, grocery, fitness, events, coworking and other new uses over time will gain a larger allocation of space alongside a significant presence of apparel, encouraging more shopping destination trips and strengthening high-quality malls as social hubs in their communities.
Throughout the industry, traditional department stores have been experiencing declining sales and market shares. As a result, some department stores have been pursuing strategies of consolidation and/or closure of under-performing locations. Given the overall quality of our real estate, however, many of our department stores have been performing comparatively well. As a result, we do not expect that we will have as many opportunities as others in our industry to reacquire and re-purpose anchor locations, with department stores often being reluctant to exit our malls. However, in the event of anchor closures, we generally expect re-purposing of anchors to add value strategically and be accretive financially.
Potential For Growth
Our principal objective is to enhance shareholder value. We seek to maximize the financial results of our core assets, while also pursuing a growth strategy that includes redevelopment of existing centers as well as a new center development program. As our current development pipeline is now largely complete in the U.S., our emphasis will now be on strengthening and growing our core assets, in addition to stabilizing our newest projects and executing our redevelopments. We continue to invest for the future and are creating value in our centers that is intended to lead to sustained growth for our shareholders. Our internally generated funds and distributions from operating centers and other investing activities (including strategic dispositions of centers or a portion of our interests therein), augmented by use of our existing revolving lines of credit and unsecured term loans, provide resources to maintain our current operations and assets, pay dividends, and fund a portion of our major capital investments. We pursue an overall strategy of creating value and recycling capital using long-term fixed rate financing on the centers upon stabilization. Excess proceeds from refinancings typically are used to reinvest in our business. Generally, our need to access the capital markets is limited to refinancing debt obligations at or near maturity and, funding major capital investments. From time to time, we also may access the equity markets or sell interests in shopping centers to raise additional funds or refinance existing obligations on a strategic basis, including using excess proceeds therefrom.
Internal Growth
As noted in "Business Strategy and Philosophy" above in detail, our core business strategy is to maintain a portfolio of properties that deliver above-market profitable growth by providing targeted retailers with the best opportunity to do business in each market and targeted shoppers with the best local shopping experience for their needs.
We continue to expect that over time a significant portion of our future growth will come from our existing core portfolio and business. We have always had and will continue to have a culture of intensively managing our assets and maximizing the rents from mall tenants over the long-term as this is a key growth driver going forward.
An element of our internal growth over time is the strategic expansion and redevelopment of existing properties to update and enhance their market positions by adding, replacing, re-tenanting, or otherwise re-merchandising the use of anchor space, increasing mall tenant space, or rebranding centers. Most of the centers have been designed to accommodate expansions. Expansion projects can be as significant as new shopping center construction in terms of scope and cost, requiring governmental and existing anchor store approvals, design and engineering activities, including rerouting utilities, providing additional parking areas or decking, acquiring additional land, and relocating anchors and mall tenants (all of which must take place with minimum disruption to existing tenants and customers).
 7

We substantially completed our redevelopment project at Beverly Center in November 2018, which included a complete renovation and significant re-merchandising, including transformation of food offerings. Additionally, we have an ongoing redevelopment project at The Mall at Green Hills that will add approximately 170,000 square feet of incremental GLA that we expect to be completed in 2019. 
We also look to monetize our common areas through robust specialty leasing and sponsorship programs. About 8% of our 2018 comparable center Net Operating Income (NOI) was generated from such programs. In the past five years, comparable center NOI from leasing and sponsorship programs has ranged from 8% to 9%. Examples found in our centers include destination holiday experiences, customer service programs, sponsored children's play areas, and turnkey attractions. In addition, we monetize our common areas through static and digital media that comes in a variety of formats.
External Growth
We pursue various areas of external growth, including traditional center development in the U.S., new opportunities in Asia, and acquisitions in both the U.S. and Asia. We have invested in a development project, Starfield Anseong, in South Korea for which we have formed an additional joint venture with Shinsegae Group (Shinsegae). Additionally, we opened one new center in 2017 and three new centers in 2016: one in Hawaii, one in South Korea, and two in China. We continue to evaluate various development and acquisition possibilities for additional new centers. 
Development of New U.S. Centers
We have developed 14 U.S. properties since 1998, or an average of about one every 18 months. Our most recent U.S. development, International Market Place, opened in Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii in August 2016. We have a 93.5% interest in the 0.3 million square foot center, which is subject to a participating ground lease.
Given the over saturation of suburban retail in the U.S., almost no new supply of suburban malls is expected in the foreseeable future. Current trends suggest that any future new supply of malls will likely be limited and in the format of mixed-use or destination projects. We do expect expansions of high-quality malls will continue as lower quality centers atrophy. In the next five years, in addition to The Mall at Green Hills expansion, we will pro-actively pursue the re-purposing of anchors where appropriate. We do not anticipate significant new ground-up developments.
While we will continue to evaluate potential future U.S. development projects using criteria, including financial criteria for rates of return, similar to those employed in the past, no assurances can be given that the adherence to these criteria will produce comparable or projected results in the future. In addition, the costs of shopping center development opportunities that are explored but ultimately abandoned will, to some extent, diminish the overall return on development projects taken as a whole. See "MD&A – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Spending" for further discussion of our development activities.
In 2015, we made a decision not to move forward with an enclosed mall that was intended to be part of the Miami Worldcenter mixed-use, urban development in Miami, Florida. Miami Worldcenter's master developer, Miami Worldcenter Associates, is pursuing a high street retail plan as a part of their master development of the site. We have agreed with Miami Worldcenter Associates on terms for a co-leasing services agreement with The Forbes Company for the retail portion of the street level project, with an option to purchase the retail component at a favorable price once it opens.
Asia
We are pursuing a development strategy in Asia to:

• | provide additional growth through exposure to countries that have more rapidly growing gross domestic products (GDPs);


• | utilize our expertise, including leasing/retailer relationships, design/development expertise, and operational/marketing skills; and


• | take advantage of a generational opportunity, as the demand for high-quality retail is early to mid-cycle, there is significant deal flow, and it diversifies longer-term growth investment opportunities.

Taubman Asia is responsible for our operations and development in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on China and South Korea. We have pursued a strategy of seeking strategic partners to jointly develop high-quality malls in our areas of focus. Taubman Asia is engaged in projects that leverage our strong retail planning, design, and operational capabilities with our strategic partners being responsible for acquiring and entitling the land and leading construction. 
 8

We envision that the Asia business will be a smaller but complementary and important part of the overall business. We have built three high-quality shopping centers and a fully integrated development and management platform with strategic, local partners. Our goal is to create a platform that finances itself by bringing in new capital partners, and potentially adding additional operating partners where appropriate, to create a less capital-intensive business that can grow the asset base with improved returns on equity, which is evidenced by our institutional partner in Starfield Hanam and the agreement with The Blackstone Group L.P. (Blackstone) to sell 50% of our interests in Starfield Hanam, CityOn.Xi'an, and CityOn.Zhengzhou described below.
As part of our Asia strategy, we look to mitigate our operating costs through property management fees and third-party service contracts when possible. We currently provide management and advisory services to third parties in Asia. We also attempt to manage risks and financial returns for our Asia developments through actively managing and limiting pre-construction costs, ensuring there is adequate anchor and tenant interest in the project prior to construction, and pursuing initial projects that are already fully entitled with partners having appropriate expertise in land acquisition and local regulatory issues. Developments in China and South Korea are subject to income taxes and taxes upon repatriation of earnings that also must be planned for and managed.
We have a joint venture with Shinsegae, one of South Korea's largest retailers, to build, lease, and manage Starfield Anseong, an approximately 1.1 million square foot shopping center, in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. We expect to beneficially own a 24.5% interest in the project; however we currently own and are funding 49% of the project until an additional capital partner is admitted. The center is scheduled to open in late 2020. 
We also have an additional joint venture with Shinsegae that owns and manages an approximately 1.7 million square foot shopping center, Starfield Hanam, in Hanam, South Korea. The center opened in September 2016. We are currently partnered with a major institution in Asia for a 49% ownership interest in Starfield Hanam. As of December 31, 2018, the institutional partner owned 14.7% of the center, bringing our effective ownership to 34.3%.
We also have two joint ventures with Wangfujing Group Co., Ltd (Wangfujing), one of China's largest department store chains. The first joint venture owns an interest in and manages an approximately 1.0 million square foot shopping center, CityOn.Xi'an, which opened in April 2016 and is located at Xi'an Saigao City Plaza, a large-scale mixed-use development in Xi'an, China. As of December 31, 2018, we had an effective 50% ownership interest in the center. The second joint venture with Wangfujing owns an interest in and manages an approximately 0.9 million square foot shopping center, CityOn.Zhengzhou, which opened in March 2017 and is located in Zhengzhou, China. As of December 31, 2018, we had a 49% ownership interest in the center.
In February 2019, we announced agreements to sell 50% of our interests in Starfield Hanam, CityOn.Xi’an, and CityOn.Zhengzhou to funds managed by Blackstone. Following the transactions, which are subject to customary closing conditions and are expected to close throughout 2019, we will retain a 17.15% ownership interest in Starfield Hanam, a 25% ownership interest in CityOn.Xi'an, and a 24.5% ownership interest in CityOn.Zhengzhou. We will remain the partner responsible for the joint management of the three shopping centers, with Blackstone paying a property service fee. The interests to be sold are valued at $480 million, with net cash proceeds expected to be about $315 million, after transaction costs and the allocation to Blackstone of its share of third-party debt. Also, we may receive up to an additional $50 million of consideration based on the 2019 performance of the three assets.
See "MD&A - Results of Operations - Taubman Asia" for further details regarding our activities in Asia.
Strategic Acquisitions
We expect attractive opportunities to acquire existing centers, or interests in existing centers, from other companies may be scarce and expensive. However, we continue to look for assets in both the U.S. and Asia where we can add significant value or that would be strategic to the rest of our portfolio. Our objective is to acquire existing centers only when they are compatible with the quality of our portfolio, or can be redeveloped to that level. We also may acquire additional interests in centers currently in our portfolio.
In March 2016, a joint venture we formed with The Macerich Company acquired Country Club Plaza, a mixed-use retail and office property in Kansas City, Missouri, from Highwood Properties for $660 million ($330 million at TRG’s beneficial share) in cash, excluding transaction costs. This purchase is consistent with our strategy to own high-quality, dominant assets in great markets. See "MD&A - Results of Operations - Acquisition - Country Club Plaza" for additional information regarding the acquisition.

Redevelopment Agreement for Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield
In May 2018, we closed on a redevelopment agreement for Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield. As of May 1, 2018, all operations at the center, as well as the building and improvements, were transferred to The Staenberg Group (TSG). TSG leases the land from us through a long-term, participating ground lease and we receive ground lease payments and a share of the property’s revenues above a specified level. TSG is planning a significant redevelopment of the property, which will transform it into a unique entertainment, shopping and dining destination. See "MD&A - Results of Operations - Redevelopment Agreement for Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield" for further details regarding the redevelopment agreement.
Rental Rates
As leases have expired in the centers, we have generally been able to rent the available space, either to the existing tenant or a new tenant, at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases. Generally, center revenues have increased as older leases rolled over or were terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that were usually higher than the average rates for existing leases. In periods of increasing sales, rents on new leases will generally tend to rise. In periods of slower growth or declining sales, rents on new leases will generally grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason, as tenants' expectations of future growth become less optimistic. Where appropriate, we are occasionally making decisions as we re-tenant space to use some shorter leases in order to maintain occupancy, merchandising, and preserve cash flow when possible; this activity can have a material impact on our releasing spread for an applicable period. See "Risk Factors" for further information.
The following table contains certain information regarding average mall tenant minimum rent per square foot of our Consolidated Businesses and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures at the comparable centers (centers that had been owned and open for the current and preceding year, excluding centers impacted by significant redevelopment activity, as well as The Mall of San Juan due to the impact of Hurricane Maria). Comparable center statistics for 2018 and 2017 exclude Beverly Center, CityOn.Zhengzhou, The Mall of San Juan, and Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield. Average rent per square foot statistics reflect the contractual rental terms of the leases currently in effect and include the impact of rental concessions.

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | 2014

(1) | Excludes rents from temporary in-line tenants and centers not open and operating at December 31, 2018.


(2) | In addition to tenants with spaces 10,000 square feet or less, includes tenants with spaces over 10,000 square feet and value and outlet center anchors. Excludes rents from mall anchors and temporary in-line tenants.


(3) | Weighted average of the annualized contractual rent per square foot as of the end of the reporting period.


(4) | Excludes leases that expire in 2019 for which renewal leases or leases with replacement tenants have been executed as of December 31, 2018.

We believe that the information in the table is not necessarily indicative of what will occur in the future, principally because of early lease terminations at the centers. The average remaining term of the leases that were terminated during the 2013 to 2018 period was approximately one year. The average term of leases signed was approximately seven years during both 2018 and 2017, excluding temporary in-line tenants (TILs).
In addition, mall tenants at the centers may seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws, which could result in the termination of such tenants' leases and thus cause a reduction in cash flow. In 2018, tenants representing 1.6% of leases filed for bankruptcy during the year compared to 3.1% in 2017. This statistic has ranged from 0.8% to 3.1% of leases per year over the last five years. The annual provision for losses on accounts receivable represents 0.6% of total revenues in 2018 and has ranged from 0.4% to 1.8% over the last five years. However, many bankruptcies do not ultimately impact our occupancy because historically less than half of bankrupt tenants actually close.

Major Tenants
No single retail company represents 5% or more of our Mall GLA or revenues. The combined operations of Forever 21 accounted for about 4% of Mall GLA as of December 31, 2018 and less than 3% of 2018 minimum rent. No other single retail company accounted for more than 4% of Mall GLA as of December 31, 2018 or 4% of 2018 minimum rent.
The following table shows the ten mall tenants who occupy the most Mall GLA at our centers and their square footage as of December 31, 2018:

Competition
There are numerous shopping facilities that compete with our properties in attracting retailers to lease space. We compete with other major real estate investors with significant capital for attractive investment opportunities. We also compete with online retailers as they draw sales away from our tenants or reduce sales attributed to their stores in our centers, which impacts rental rates. See "Risk Factors" for further details of our competitive business.
Seasonality
The shopping center industry in the U.S. is seasonal in nature, with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the Christmas season, and with lesser, though still significant, sales fluctuations associated with the Easter holiday and back-to-school period. See "MD&A – Seasonality" for further discussion.
Environmental Matters
See "Risk Factors" regarding discussion of environmental matters.

Personnel
The Manager provides real estate management, acquisition, development, leasing, and administrative services required by us and our properties in the United States, and employs all of our U.S. employees, including our executive officers. Taubman Asia Management Limited (TAM) and certain other affiliates provide similar services for third parties in China and South Korea as well as Taubman Asia. The Manager is 99.8% beneficially owned by TRG and 0.2% owned by Taub-Co Holdings LLC (Taub-Co), which is 100% owned by members of the Taubman Family. The Manager receives fees from the shopping centers, TCO, TRG, and their respective affiliates and third parties in exchange for the performance of its services. Since TRG has an approximate 99.8% beneficial interest in the Manager, substantially all of these fees accrue to TRG, with a de minimis portion of the fees accruing to the benefit of Taub-Co through its 0.2% beneficial interest in the Manager. For more information about the Manager, see "Risk Factors - Members of the Taubman Family have the power to vote a significant number of the shares of Capital Stock entitled to vote and have contractual rights."
As of December 31, 2018, the Manager, TAM, and certain other affiliates had 450 full time employees.
