Business Overview
 
Unique Logistics International, Inc. provides a full range of global logistics services by providing to its customers a robust international network that strategically supports the movement of its customers’ goods. Acting solely as a third-party logistics provider, Unique purchases available cargo space in volume from its network of carriers (such as airlines, ocean shipping, and trucking lines) and resells that space to our customers. Unique Logistics does not own any of these ships, trucks, or aircraft and does not plan on entering the ownership model.
 
Operating via its wholly owned subsidiaries, Unique Logistics International (BOS) Inc, a Massachusetts corporation (“UL BOS”) and Unique Logistics International (NYC), LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Unique Logistics provides a range of international logistics services that enable its customers to outsource to the Company sections of their supply chain process. The services provided by the Company are seamlessly managed by its network of trained employees and integrated information systems. We enable our customers to share data regarding their international vendors and purchase orders with us, execute the flow of goods and information under their operating instructions, provide visibility to the flow of goods from factory to distribution center or store and when required, update their inventory records.
 
Unique Logistics primary services include:
 

● | Air Freight services 
--+----------------------------------------------
● | Ocean Freight services 
● | Customs Brokerage and Compliance services 
● | Warehousing and Distribution services 
● | Order Management 

Air Freight Services
 
Operating as an Indirect Air Carrier (IAC) or an airfreight consolidator, Unique Logistics provides both time savings and cost-effective air freight options to its customers. An expansive global network enables the Company to offer door to door service allowing customers to benefit from our expert staff for guidance with the physical movement of cargo and documentation compliance. Unique purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to our customers at a lower price than they would be able to negotiate themselves for their individual shipments. The Company, through its integrated management system, determines the best routing for shipments and then arrangements are made to receive the cargo into a designated warehouse. Upon receipt, cargo is inspected and weighed, documentation is collected, and export clearance is processed. Once cargo is cleared it is prepared for departure. Unique Logistics offers real-time tracking visibility for customers to view when an order is booked, departs and arrives. Unique Logistics contracts with a worldwide network of airlines and other service providers to provide the best airfreight service in assisting importers to ship using the most efficient and cost-effective method. Some of the selections we offer include:

● | International, domestic, deferred, express and charter services, which permit customers to choose from a menu of different priority options that secure at different price levels, greater assurance of timely delivery 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Port to Port and Door to Door shipments, which provide customers the option of managing, independently, the post arrival services such as delivery or clearance if the Company is not providing such services 
● | Global blocked space agreements (BSA), which guarantee the availability of space on certain flights 
● | Air and ocean combination shipment which offer cost effective transportation using multimodal, combination movements, by one mode to an international hub, such as Dubai, UAE or Singapore and converting to a different mode at the hub 
● | Air and transload dedicated truck shipment, where arriving cargo is transferred from airline container or pallet into a truckload ready for delivery 
● | Dangerous goods handling requiring qualified handling 
● | Refrigerated cargo

Our Air Freight customer base is comprised of importers who are in various industries including fashion retail, technology and general department stores merchandise importers. The majority of shipments originate in Asian manufacturing countries. Air Freight is seasonal for fashion retailers, with the period July through December being much stronger than the remaining six months. For technology companies, the seasonal impact is less pronounced.
 
The Company works with its international network to ensure air freight shipping capacity is secured and planned in advance to meet our customers’ requirements. The capacity is then made available to our customers at competitive pricing and with the added security of availability, particularly during peak Air Freight shipping periods. We supplement scheduled capacity with full charter capacity to ensure customer capacity requirements are met throughout the year. While capacity management is critical to securing and maintaining Air Freight customers, the Company will try to quickly move to the position of offering additional primary services to our Air Freight customers.
 
The Company’s integrated management system is built around a cloud-based software package known as Cargo Wise. The software is accessible to our offices or overseas third party associates when planning and recording the receipt of cargo and booking shipments. The Cargo Wise system assists in the creation of documentation required to plan each shipment, including Management Information Systems that enable our Operational Management Teams to generate reports or provide access to information to our customers so that they have daily visibility to their purchased orders. This enables shipments to be approved, planned and routed within the available air freight capacity procured by the Company. The Cargo Wise software is part of the integrated management system that also incorporates (in some cases with interface) airline resources, congestion/ market condition information, pricing databases, customer preferences in Key Account Management databases and the trained personnel and experienced managers that make decisions as required based on the information.
 
Ocean Freight Services
 
Operating as an ocean transportation intermediary (“OTI”) to provide ocean freight service both as a non-vessel owning common carrier (“NVOCC”) and ocean freight forwarder, Unique Logistics provides to its customers ocean freight consolidation, direct ocean forwarding, and order management. We are a common carrier that holds itself out to the public to provide ocean transportation, issues its own house bills of lading or equivalent document, but does not operate the vessels by which ocean transportation is provided. The Company’s roles and responsibilities in ocean freight services include the following:

● | Selecting the most optimal ocean carriers based on both cost and service. The Company has NVOCC contracts with multiple ocean carriers and is thus able to offer its customers a choice in service; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Entering into contract/rate agreement with clients to transport their ocean shipments. Under such contracts the customer is assured of the Company’s pricing and weekly capacity to carry the customer’s cargo; 
● | Consolidating shipments at origin/deconsolidating of freight at destination. This enables the customer to receive the economics of a consolidated container rate rather than a higher rate for less than full container load (“LCL”). It also makes delivery at destination more efficient; 
● | Arranging pick-up of shipment at origin and deliver at destination, with a factory to door service; 
● | Preparing and processing the documentation/clearance (customs/security) for shipments during ocean transit, in advance of arrival of shipment at destination; 
● | Ocean freight services are provided in both major and minor trade lanes with representation in all trading nations in Americas, Asia, and Europe; 
● | Offering a wide array of services typically performed by multiple services provides including but not limited to, offering options to customers on ocean carrier service choices prior to final selection and securing such space based on customer requirement; this enables our customers to delegate more of its logistics management to us whereas a more limited range of service would require the customer to deal with multiple service providers; 
● | Communicating on any regulation/compliance issues on exporting and importing shipments; 
● | Playing intermediary role at any point of ocean transportation based on customer’s routing preferences; and 
● | Providing space acquisition on carrier service for committed delivery during high demand period, and providing lower price option in weak demand season for utmost cost saving. 

 
The website of Datamyne, a Descartes company (us1.datamyne.com) as of January 14, 2022 lists the Company as a top 100 NVOCC on the Transpacific Eastbound sector. Some of the major industry sectors we serve are Home Products and Appliances, Furniture, Automotive, Giftware and Fashion. Our customers are both retailers as well as wholesale importers. Our volumes enable us to enter significant contracts with shipping lines to lock in capacity at prices that enable us to secure and retain customers.

Customs Brokerage and Compliance Services
 
Unique Logistics is a licensed United States customs broker whose mission is to ensure that its importing clients are in compliance with all required regulations. Our services help importers clear cargo with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including documentation collection, valuation review, product classification, electronic submission to customs and the collection and payment of duties, tariffs and fees. Unique Logistics works with importers to develop a compliant trade program including product databases, compliance manuals and periodic internal audits. The development of product databases has become critical in the current economic environment due to the increasing trade tensions and various tariffs imposed as a result. Unique Logistics also offers importers tools to improve on efficiency such as reporting, visibility and trade consulting including training seminars. Additional services include:

● | Preparation of the Import Security Filing (10+2) required to be on file 24 hours prior to shipment departure; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Clearance and compliance with other government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Consumer Product Safety Commission and U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service; 
● | Focused assessment and internal audit to determine and eliminate weak areas of compliance; 
● | Post-entry service to change past entries and take advantage of tariff exclusions granted after the original entry was processed; 
● | Binding rulings to obtain pre-entry classification; 
● | Classification & valuation; 
● | Trade agreements; 
● | Warehouse entries to defer duty; 
● | Licensing and country of origin marking requirements; 
● | Free Trade Zone (FTZ); 
● | Duty drawback to get duty back on items exported under certain requirements; and 
● | Cargo insurance coverage 

Warehousing and Distribution Services
 
Unique Logistics operates a warehousing facility in Santa Fe Springs, CA and plans to expand such services through its own managed facilities. Unique Logistics also provides warehousing and distribution services through third party facilities. Our current facility is leased to the Company and is 110,000 sq. ft. with storage capacity for around 9,000 pallets and 10 dedicated employees.
 
Warehousing and Distribution services enable Unique Logistics to greatly expand its involvement in our customers’ supply chain, post arrival of international shipments into the United States. By providing inventory management, order fulfillment, and other services, our customers benefit from cost savings related to space, equipment and labor due to efficiencies of scale. Our list of Warehousing and Distribution Services include the following:
 

● | Transloading of cargo from incoming containers to trucks for delivery 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Pick and pack services 
● | Quality control services under customer instructions 
● | Kitting 
● | Storage 
● | Inventory management 
● | Delivery services, including e-Commerce fulfillment services 

 
Warehousing and Distribution is a higher margin business than Air Freight or Ocean Freight. In the case of freight service we are primarily re-selling capacity while in Warehousing and Distribution we are offering services based on fixed space cost, fixed staffing and equipment cost and relatively smaller variable labor and equipment cost. The customer base comprises freight customers with Warehousing and Distribution needs as well as customers who are exclusively Warehousing and Distribution service users. They are in a variety of industries: foot-ware, apparel, giftware, home appliances, etc. The customers are billed under three broad categories: Storage, Transloading (with quick turnaround and no storage) and Other Warehouse Services listed above. The location of our existing warehouse, within 15 miles of the Port of Los Angeles/ Long Beach and 20 miles from Los Angeles Airport is an important factor for our customers. Racking as well as bulk storage space availability enables us to handle a variety of customer requirements. In recent years, severe congestion at the terminals serving the Port of Los Angeles/ Long Beach has increased the demand for Transloading as well as short-term storage services at warehouses such as ours that are within a 50 mile radius of the Port.
 
The current facility is the first and only facility of its type operated by us. Warehousing and Distribution is an important opportunity for our business expansion.

Industry Overview and Competition
 
The global logistics industry is highly competitive, and we expect it to remain so for the foreseeable future. Although there are a large number of companies that compete or provide services in one or more segments of the logistics industry, Unique Logistics is part of a much smaller group of companies that provides a full suite of services. In each area of service, we face competition from companies operating within that service segment as well as companies that provide a wider range of global services.
 
The industry includes (i) specialized Non-Vessel Owning Common Carriers (“NVOCCs”), an ocean carrier that transports goods under its own House Bill of Lading, or equivalent documentation, without operating ocean transportation vessels and (ii) Indirect Air Carriers (“IACs”) which are persons or entities within the United States, not in possession of an FAA air carrier operating certificate, which undertake to engage indirectly in air transportation of property and uses for all or any part of such transportation the services of an air carrier, freight forwarders, trucking companies, customs brokers and warehouse operators who operate within their specialized space and very often pose pricing advantages within that segment.
 
Our mission is to bring value to our customers through specific competitive advantages:
 

● | Trained, experienced staff with knowledge of those areas of the world where customers are likely to require problem solving abilities. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Trained, experienced staff with knowledge of the various supply chain segments: Air, Ocean, Customs, Warehousing and Information Technology integration. 
● | Responsive customer service and the ability to meet our customer needs with people at the front of well-established processes. 

 
Our customer base includes companies in a wide range of industries. Some of the major industry sectors we serve are Home Products and Appliances, Furniture, Fashion Retail, Automotive and Technology. We aim to provide a wide range of services to each customer and cross sell all of our primary services.

Ocean Freight services and Air Freight services are the most significant revenue drivers for the Company. To distinguish our service offerings from our competitors our primary focus is on capacity management for these services. Our volumes enable us to enter significant contracts with shipping lines to lock in capacity at prices that enable us to secure and retain customers. Similarly, our Air Freight capacity strategy includes rate/ space agreements with scheduled airlines as well as a full air cargo charter program under which we are able to lock in capacity for our customers at contracted rates.
 
While capacity management is critical to establishing relations with new customers and securing existing ones, it is essential for the Company to expand its range of services to each customer. Our customer support teams will work with each customer to identify the areas such as Customs Brokerage, Warehousing & Distribution and Order Management where our service offerings may create additional value-added opportunities within the customer’s supply chain.
 
Seasonality
 
Historically, our own operating results, as well as the industry as a whole, have been subject to seasonal demand. With our financial year end of May 31, typically our first and second quarters are the strongest with the fourth quarter being the weakest; however, there are no guarantees that these trends will continue. These seasonal trends are influenced by a number of factors, including weather patterns, national holidays, economic conditions, consumer demand, major product launches, as well as a number of other market forces. Since many of these forces are unforeseen there is no way for us to provide assurances that these seasonal trends will continue.
Growth Strategy 
 
Unique Logistics has established plans to grow its business by focusing on the following key areas: (1) organic growth and expansion in existing markets; (2) strategic acquisitions; (3) warehousing and distribution; (4) growth of business on the Trans-Atlantic and Latin American trade lanes; and (5) specialized services to United States companies on their overseas logistics needs in conjunction with the export and distribution of products in certain Asian markets such as India, Vietnam and China.
Organic Growth and Expansion in Existing Markets:
 
We plan to focus on developing business domestically to drive organic growth. Since our initial formation and combination, we have significantly improved our operating efficiencies in the areas of procurement, customer service, finance and administration. We have achieved this by consolidating our volumes, centralizing many of the functions previously handled separately by individual operating subsidiaries and rationalizing our organizational structure hiring and empowering experienced executives in critical positions including the hiring of a full time Chief Operating Officer. We believe this resulted in much lower overhead and the ability to build a uniform marketing strategy to build market share and further the brand recognition of Unique Logistics throughout the United States. Additionally, the Company will continuously assess its Information Technology environment based on emerging trends in logistics and customer requirements. The first step in the strategy is already in place: a single operating platform. We will continue to build add-on service tools that enhance our operating platform. One key area for technology focus will be the seamless delivery of e-Commerce services from origin to consumer with shipment visibility for both customer and the customer’s consumer.
 
We believe Unique Logistics’ business base that includes three out of the fifty largest importers in the United States can be expanded by building our sales organization and the support organization to successfully deliver our brand of service.
 
Strategic Acquisitions:
 
On April 28, 2022, the Company entered into the Purchase Agreement, by and between the Company and ULHK, whereby the Company is planning to acquire prior to December 31, 2022, from ULHK all of ULHK’s share capital in nine (9) of ULHK’s subsidiaries as listed in Schedule I of the Purchase Agreement. The acquisition of the Subsidiaries is in line with our strategic plan to become a leading supply chain service provider. We believe that these acquisitions would serve to strengthen our control over supply chain services including capacity management and procurement.

Warehousing and Distribution
 
Unique Logistics has successfully established a major warehousing facility in Santa Fe Springs, CA and now has in-house the management expertise (commercial as well as operational) in successfully managing such facilities. Unique Logistics has also identified a method of identifying growth opportunities by focusing on specific areas of the United States and existing well-constructed facilities where lease assumption is available with an existing customer base.
Specialized Services to US Companies in Overseas Markets
 
Unique Logistics has several decades of experience in Asian markets such as India, Vietnam and China. Unique Logistics is constantly interacting with a United States customer base that seeks to do business in these areas but requires local expertise. We have the experience and the connections to assist United States companies with local importation, local warehousing and distribution and other local logistics and trade compliance services. We plan to build on our expertise in these three specific countries to build tailored services to US customers, including in business consulting pertaining to logistics and related trade services.
Government Regulations and Security
 
Our industry is subject to regulation and supervision by several governmental authorities.
 
Operations
 
The U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), have regulatory authority over our air transportation services. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, is the statutory basis for DOT and FAA authority and the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, is the basis for TSA aviation security authority.
 
All United States indirect air carriers are required to maintain prescribed security procedures and are subject to periodic audits by the TSA. Our overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation. Our offices are licensed as an airfreight forwarder from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities that prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members.
 
The shipping of goods by sea is regulated by the Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”). Our Company is licensed by the FMC to operate as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary (“OTI”) and as a NVOCC. As a licensed OTI and NVOCC, we are required to comply with several regulations, including the filing of our tariffs.
 
Under Department of Homeland Security regulations, we are a qualified participant in the Customs- Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“C-TPAT”) program requiring us to be compliant with relevant security procedures in our operations.
 
We are licensed as a customs broker by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Agency of DHS, nationally and in each U.S. customs district in which we do business. All United States customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by CBP. In other jurisdictions in which we perform customs clearance services, we are licensed by the appropriate governmental authority where such license is required to perform these services.
 
We do not believe that current United States and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon our business operations. However, the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to our ability to provide the full range of our business activities in a wholly or majority United States-owned subsidiary. For example, foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and, less frequently, the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding and/or freight consolidation is restricted to local entities. When we encounter this sort of governmental restriction, we work to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations, while also providing the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation. This can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required license.

Environmental
 
We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations across all of our business units. These laws and regulations cover a variety of processes, including, but not limited to: proper storage, handling and disposal of waste materials; appropriately managing wastewater and stormwater; monitoring and maintaining the integrity of underground storage tanks; complying with laws regarding clean air, including those governing emissions; protecting against and appropriately responding to spills and releases and communicating the presence of reportable quantities of hazardous materials to local responders. We have established site- and activity-specific environmental compliance and pollution prevention programs to address our environmental responsibilities and remain compliant. In addition, we have created several programs which seek to minimize waste and prevent pollution within our operations.
Corporate History
 
Unique Logistics International, Inc. (the “Company” or “Unique”) (formerly Innocap, Inc.) was incorporated in Nevada on January 23, 2004. In May 2011, the Company changed its business plan to begin researching the location of and salvaging sunken ships. Until October 2020, the Company had been actively negotiating several research and salvage projects in Indonesia, Malaysia, and other countries in connection with ships that were sunk during World War II.
 
Unique Logistics Holdings, Inc. (“Unique”) a Delaware corporation, was formed on October 28, 2019, for the purpose of conducting a management buyout of three United States subsidiaries majority owned by Unique Logistics Holdings Ltd., a Hong Kong company (“UL HK”).
 
UL HK was incorporated in Hong Kong in 1983. UL HK commenced its business with a focus on transpacific logistics services because of the increasing demands of trade between Hong Kong and the United States. The initial focus was on air freight services, but UL HK quickly diversified into ocean freight services. In its first fifteen years of operations, UL HK established itself as a major international logistics service provider in Hong Kong. Driven by the needs of its customer base, from 1997 through 2012, UL HK established a network of offices throughout Asia and the United States. By the end of 2012, the Unique Logistics brand was well recognized in several Asian countries including China, India, and Vietnam. In the United States, UL HK offices in Boston, Atlanta, New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago had a growing United States customer base in several sectors such as fashion, department stores, furniture, toys, and home goods. The vast majority of ULHK’s international business consisted of services pertaining to United States based companies.
 
On May 29, 2020, Unique Logistics Holdings, Inc., a privately held Delaware corporation headquartered in New York (“ULHI”), entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Unique Logistics Holdings Ltd, (“UL HK”), a Hong Kong company, (the “UL HK Transaction”). pursuant to which the Company purchased from UL HK (i) sixty percent (60%) of the membership interests of (“UL ATL Membership Interests”) of Unique Logistics International (ATL) LLC, a Georgia limited liability company (“UL ATL”); (ii) eighty percent (80%) of the common stock of Unique Logistics International (BOS) Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (“UL BOS”); and (iii) sixty-five percent (65%) of the Unique Logistics International (USA) Inc., a New York corporation (“UL NY”).
 
On October 8, 2020, the Company, Inno Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger Sub”), and ULHI. entered into an Acquisition Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Acquisition Agreement”) pursuant to which the Merger Sub was merged with and into ULHI, with ULHI surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). The Company acquired, through a reverse triangular merger, all of the outstanding capital stock of ULHI in exchange for issuing ULHI’s shareholders, pro-rata, an aggregate of 1,000,000 million shares of preferred stock, with certain of ULHI Shareholders receiving 130,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock par value $0.001 per share, and certain of the ULHI Shareholders receiving of 870,000 shares of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share. Immediately after the Merger was consummated, and further to the Acquisition Agreement, certain affiliates of the Company cancelled a total of 45,606,489 shares of the Company’s common stock, and 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock held by them (the “Cancellation”). In consideration of the Cancellation of such shares of the Company’s common stock and preferred stock, ULHI agreed to assume certain liabilities of the Company. As a result of the Merger and the Cancellation, the ULHI Shareholders became the majority shareholders of the Company. Immediately following the Closing of the Merger, the Company changed its business plan to that of ULHI.
 
On January 11, 2021, Innocap Inc. filed a certificate of amendment to its articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, for the adoption of amended and restated articles of incorporation of Innocap Inc. (the “Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation”). The adopted Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation: (i) increased the number of authorized common stock from 500,000,000 shares to 800,000,000 shares; and (ii) changed the Company’s name to Unique Logistics International, Inc. (the “Company”).
 
The Name Change was approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and became effective in the market on January 14, 2021. In connection with the name change, the Company changed its ticker symbol from “INNO” to “UNQL”.

Recent Developments:
 
On April 28, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement (the “April 2022 Purchase Agreement”), by and between the Company and Unique Logistics Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong corporation (the “Seller” and “ULHK”), whereby the Company will acquire, subject to financing, from the Seller all of Seller’s share capital (the “Purchased Shares”) in nine (9) of Seller’s subsidiaries (collectively the “Subsidiaries” and the “ULHK Entities”) as listed in Schedule I of the April 2022 Purchase Agreement (the “ULHK Entities Acquisition”).
 
As consideration for the Purchased Shares, the Company agreed to (i) pay the Seller $21,000,000 (the “Cash Consideration”); and (ii) issue to the Seller a $1,000,000 promissory note (the “Note” and, together with the Cash Consideration, the “Acquisition Purchase Price”).
 
The Acquisition Purchase Price is subject to certain adjustments set forth in the April 2022 Purchase Agreement. Accordingly, in the event that the Seller Adjusted Net Asset Amount (as defined in the April 2022 Purchase Agreement) is a positive number, the Acquisition Purchase Price at Closing (as defined in the April 2022 Purchase Agreement) shall be increased on a dollar-for dollar basis of such number up to a maximum of $4,500,000 (the “Adjusted Net Asset Maximum”, and such adjustment, the “Net Asset Positive Adjustment”), which shall be paid in two installments as a deferred dividend to Seller as follows: (A) one-half of the excess amount up to an aggregate amount of $2,500,000 to be paid at Closing, and (B) the remaining one-half of the excess amount up to an aggregate amount of $2,000,000 to be paid on the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date (as defined in April 2022 Purchase Agreement”).

However, if the Seller Adjusted Net Asset Amount (i) is a negative number, the Acquisition Purchase Price at Closing shall be decreased on a dollar-for-dollar basis by such amount up to the Adjusted Net Asset Maximum (such adjustment, the “Net Asset Negative Adjustment”, and together with the Net Asset Positive Adjustment, the “Net Asset Adjustment”) or (ii) if the Net Asset Adjustment is a positive number (the “Excess Asset Amount”) then the parties agree to have the Subsidiaries declare and distribute a dividend within twelve (12) months following the Closing Date and the Company shall pay Seller the Excess Asset Amount within twelve (12) months following the Closing Date.
 
If (i) based on the financial statements of the Subsidiaries available at the Closing Date, the Adjusted Net Asset Amount and/or the result of the calculation set forth in the Closing Adjusted Net Asset Statement (as defined in the April 2022 Purchase Agreement) is equal to or greater than five percent (5%) higher than the Adjusted Net Asset Amount and/or the result of the calculation set forth in the Seller Adjusted Net Asset Statement, as applicable, (such difference, the “Audited Excess Amount”), then Seller may, within six (6) months of the Closing Date, request the Company to pay to Seller an additional sum equivalent to the Audited Excess Amount, and the Company shall make the payment in the amount of the Audited Excess Amount to Seller within one (1) month of such request.
