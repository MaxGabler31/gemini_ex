 GENERAL 
 United Community was incorporated in the State of Ohio in February 1998 for the purpose of owning all of the outstanding capital stock of Home Savings Bank (Home Savings or the Bank) issued upon the conversion of Home Savings from a mutual savings association to a permanent capital stock savings association (Conversion). The Conversion was completed on July 8, 1998. On January 31, 2017, United Community completed an acquisition of Ohio Legacy Corp. (OLCB) and merger of United Community’s wholly-owned subsidiary bank with and into Premier Bank & Trust, OLCB’s wholly-owned subsidiary bank (PB&T), with PB&T as the surviving bank following the merger. As a result of this acquisition, United Community became a financial holding company and its surviving subsidiary bank became an Ohio-chartered bank with the name “Home Savings Bank.” The acquisition of OLCB and related merger with PB&T are discussed in further detail below under the heading “Acquisitions.”
 In addition to the Bank, United Community also operates through its subsidiaries, HSB Insurance, LLC, HSB Capital, LLC and HSB Insurance, Inc. HSB Capital, LLC was formed as an Ohio limited liability company by United Community during 2016 for the purpose of providing mezzanine funding for customers of the Bank. Mezzanine loans are offered by HSB Capital, LLC to customers in United Community’s market area, as defined below, and are expected to be repaid from the cash flow from operations of the business.  
 HSB Insurance, LLC, (d/b/a James & Sons Insurance) is a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary of United Community that was formed on April 6, 2016 to acquire James & Sons Insurance. As a result of this acquisition, HSB Insurance, LLC now offers a variety of insurance products for business and residential customers, including auto, homeowners, life-health, commercial, surety bonds and aviation, within United Community’s market area, as defined below.
 HSB Insurance, Inc., was formed on June 1, 2017 as a Delaware-based captive insurance company that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Community.  HSB Insurance, Inc. insures against certain risks that are unique to the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries and for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible; by pooling resources with several other insurance company subsidiaries of financial institutions to spread a limited amount of risk among themselves.  HSB Insurance, Inc. is subject to regulations of the State of Delaware and undergoes periodic examinations by the Delaware Division of Insurance.
 The term “Company” is used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to refer to United Community and its subsidiaries, collectively.

As a financial holding company, United Community is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and the SEC. United Community’s primary activity is holding the common shares of Home Savings. Consequently, the following discussion focuses primarily on the business of Home Savings. 
 Home Savings was organized as a mutual savings association under Ohio law in 1889. Currently, Home Savings is an Ohio-chartered bank, subject to the supervision and regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Division of Financial Institutions (ODFI) of the Ohio Department of Commerce (Ohio Division). Home Savings is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB) and the deposits of Home Savings are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. 
 Home Savings conducts business from its main office located in Youngstown, Ohio, and through 35 retail banking offices, three wealth management offices and 12 loan production centers located throughout Ohio, western Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The principal business of Home Savings is the origination of mortgage loans, including construction loans, on residential and nonresidential real estate located in Home Savings’ primary market area, which consists of Ashland, Belmont, Columbiana, Cuyahoga, Erie, Franklin, Geauga, Huron, Lake, Lucas, Mahoning, Portage, Richland, Stark, Summit and Trumbull Counties in Ohio, Allegheny and Beaver Counties in Pennsylvania and Monongalia County in West Virginia. In addition to real estate lending, Home Savings originates commercial loans and various types of consumer loans. For liquidity and interest rate risk management purposes, Home Savings invests in various financial instruments as discussed below under the heading “Investment Activities.” Funds for lending and other investment activities are obtained primarily from retail deposits, which are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC, principal repayments of loans, borrowings from the FHLB, repurchase agreements and maturities of securities. 
 Interest on loans and other investments is Home Savings’ primary source of income. Home Savings’ principal expenses are interest paid on deposit accounts and other borrowings, as well as salaries and benefits paid to employees. Operating results are dependent to a significant degree on the net interest income of Home Savings, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and other investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Like most financial institutions, Home Savings’ interest income and interest expense can be affected significantly by general economic conditions and by the policies of various regulatory authorities. 
 As of December 31, 2018, the FDIC categorized Home Savings as well capitalized. 
 ACQUISITIONS
 On January 29, 2016, United Community acquired James & Sons Insurance, an insurance agency that offers a variety of insurance products for business and residential customers, which include auto, homeowners, life-health, commercial, surety bonds, and aviation.  James & Sons Insurance was merged into HSB Insurance, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Community, with HSB Insurance, LLC as the surviving entity following the merger. This acquisition marked the initial step in the formation of The Home Savings Insurance Group. During fiscal year 2017, United Community completed two additional acquisitions to expand the product offerings and market area of HSB Insurance, LLC.  On February 28, 2017, HSB Insurance, LLC acquired Eich Brothers Insurance, an insurance agency that offers insurance products for business and residential customers, including auto, commercial, homeowners and life-health.  On July 1, 2017, HSB Insurance, LLC acquired Stevens Insurance Agency, which offers insurance products for business and residential customers, including auto, commercial, homeowners and life-health. On July 1, 2018, HSB Insurance, LLC acquired certain assets of Steinhauser Insurance Agency which offers property and casualty insurance for business and personal needs.  Home Savings intends to expand its insurance business via organic growth coupled with a selective acquisition strategy.

On January 31, 2017, United Community completed its acquisition of OLCB.  Immediately following the acquisition of OLCB, Home Savings was merged into PB&T, and PB&T changed its name to “Home Savings Bank.”  In connection with the acquisition, United Community issued 3,033,604 United Community common shares and paid $19,958,724.19 to OLCB shareholders.   As a result of the acquisition, United Community became a financial holding company and its wholly owned subsidiary became an Ohio-chartered bank. 
 LENDING ACTIVITIES
 General. Home Savings’ principal lending activity is the origination of conventional residential real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and various types of consumer loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, loans secured by deposit accounts and investments, direct and indirect auto lending and unsecured loans, primarily originated in Home Savings’ market area.

Loan Maturity. The following table sets forth certain information as of December 31, 2018, regarding the dollar amount of construction and commercial loans maturing in Home Savings’ portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity. Demand and other loans having no stated schedule of repayments or no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less. Mortgage loans originated by Home Savings always include due-on-sale clauses that provide Home Savings with the contractual right to deem the loan immediately due and payable in the event the borrower transfers the ownership of the property without Home Savings’ consent. The table does not include the effects of possible prepayments.

Commercial Loans: 
 Multifamily. Home Savings originates loans secured by multifamily properties that contain more than four units. Multifamily loans are offered with adjustable and fixed rates of interest, which adjust according to a specified index, and typically have terms ranging from five to ten years and of the value of the real estate and improvements (LTV) of up to 80%.
Multifamily lending generally is considered to involve a higher degree of risk than one-to-four-family residential lending because the borrower typically depends upon income generated by the subject property to cover operating expenses and debt service. The profitability of a subject property can be affected by economic conditions, government policies and other factors beyond the control of the borrower. Home Savings attempts to mitigate the risk associated with multifamily lending by evaluating the creditworthiness of the borrower and the projected income from the subject property and, in most cases, obtaining personal guarantees on loans made to corporations, limited liability companies and partnerships. Home Savings requires borrowers to submit financial statements annually to enable management to monitor the loan and requires an assignment of rents from borrowers. 
 At December 31, 2018, loans secured by multifamily properties totaled approximately $134.1 million, or 6.1% of total loans, of which $171,000, or 0.1% of Home Savings’ total multifamily loans, were considered nonperforming. New originations in this loan category totaled $43.2 million in 2018. 
 Nonresidential. Home Savings originates loans secured by nonresidential real estate, such as retail centers, office buildings, and industrial buildings. Home Savings’ nonresidential real estate loans typically have both fixed and adjustable rates, terms typically ranging from five to ten years and LTVs of up to 80%. The majority of such properties are located within Home Savings’ primary lending area.
Nonresidential real estate lending generally is considered to involve a higher degree of risk than residential lending due to the relatively larger loan amounts and the effects of general economic conditions on the successful operation of income-producing properties. Home Savings has endeavored to reduce such risk by evaluating the credit history of the borrower and their affiliates, the location of the real estate, analyzing the financial condition of the borrower, in most cases obtaining personal guarantees from the borrower or the borrower’s affiliates, and considering the quality and characteristics of the income stream generated by the property and the appraisal supporting the property’s valuation. 
 5


At December 31, 2018, approximately $410.0 million, or 18.7% of Home Savings’ total loans, were secured by mortgages on nonresidential real estate, of which $13,000, or 0.0% of Home Savings’ total nonresidential real estate loans, were considered nonperforming. New originations in this loan category totaled $68.7 million in 2018. 
 Land. Home Savings also originates a limited number of loans secured by vacant land. Home Savings’ land loans generally are fixed-rate loans for terms of up to five years and require a LTV of 65% or less. At December 31, 2018, approximately $16.8 million, or 0.8%, of Home Savings’ total loans were land loans. None of these loans were nonperforming at December 31, 2018. New originations in this loan category totaled $8.9 million in 2018. 
 Construction.  Home Savings originates loans for the construction of multifamily properties and nonresidential real estate projects.  Construction loans for multifamily and nonresidential properties typically have LTV at origination of up to 75% based on estimated value at completion, with the value of the land included as part of the owner’s equity.  
 Construction loans involve greater underwriting and default risks than loans secured by mortgages on existing properties because construction loans are more difficult to appraise and to monitor.  Loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction.  In the event a default on a construction loan occurs and foreclosure follows, Home Savings may take control of the project and attempt either to arrange for completion of construction or dispose of the unfinished project.  
 At December 31, 2018, Home Savings had approximately $141.7 million, or 6.5% of its total loans, invested in commercial construction loans.  None of these loans were nonperforming at December 31, 2018.  New originations for commercial construction loans totaled $96.0 million in 2018.  
 Secured and Unsecured. Home Savings makes commercial loans to businesses in its primary market area, including traditional lines of credit, revolving lines of credit and term loans. The collateral coverage ratios for commercial loans depend upon the nature of the underlying collateral. Lines of credit and revolving credits generally are priced on a floating rate basis, which is tied to the prime interest rate or LIBOR. Term loans usually have adjustable rates, but can have fixed rates of interest, and typically have terms of one to five years.
The repayment of commercial loans typically is dependent on the cash flow stream and successful operation of a business, which can be affected by economic conditions. The collateral for commercial term loans often consists of depreciating assets, which are generally matched to the amortization of the underlying loan. 
 At December 31, 2018, Home Savings had approximately $233.3 million invested in secured commercial loans and $7.0 million in unsecured commercial loans. The majority of these loans are secured by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, investment property, vehicles or other assets of the borrower. These loans are underwritten based on the creditworthiness of the borrower and the guarantors, where applicable. 
 Nonperforming secured and unsecured commercial loans at December 31, 2018 amounted to $531,000, or 0.2% of total commercial secured and unsecured loans. New originations of commercial loans totaled $148.6 million in 2018, of which $146.9 million were secured. 
 Residential Mortgage Loans: 
 One-to-Four-Family. Home Savings mainly originates conventional loans secured by first mortgages on one-to-four-family residences primarily located within Home Savings’ market area. 
 Home Savings currently offers fixed-rate mortgage loans and adjustable-rate mortgage loans (ARMs). Although Home Savings’ loan portfolio includes a significant amount of 30-year fixed-rate loans, a considerable portion of fixed rate loans are originated for sale. The interest rate adjustment periods on ARMs are typically one, three, five, seven or ten years. The maximum interest rate adjustment on most of the ARMs is 2.0% on any adjustment date and a total of 6.0% over the life of the loan. The interest rate adjustments on three-year, five-year and ten-year ARMs presently offered by Home Savings are indexed to the weekly average rate on the one-year U.S. Treasury securities. Rate adjustments are computed by adding a stated margin to the index. 
 FDIC regulations and Ohio law limit the amount that Home Savings may lend in relationship to the appraised value of the real estate and improvements that secure the loan at the time of loan origination. In accordance with such regulations, Home Savings is permitted to make loans up to 100% of the LTV. Home Savings typically requires private mortgage insurance on the portion of the principal amount of the loan that exceeds 80% of the appraised value or sales price of the property (whichever is less) securing the loan. 
 6


Under certain circumstances, Home Savings will offer loans with LTVs exceeding 80% without private mortgage insurance. Customers may borrow up to 80% of the home’s appraised value and obtain a second loan or line of credit from Home Savings for up to 90% of the appraised value without having to purchase mortgage insurance. Home Savings also offers a first-time homebuyers product that permits an LTV of 97% without private mortgage insurance. Such loans involve a higher degree of risk because, in the event of a borrower default, the value of the underlying collateral may not satisfy the principal and interest outstanding on the loan. To reduce this risk, Home Savings underwrites all portfolio loans to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae underwriting guidelines. 
 Currently, no interest-only, one-to-four-family loans are contained in the Home Savings’ mortgage loan portfolio. 
 Home Savings issues loan origination commitments to qualified borrowers primarily for the purchase of single-family residential real estate. Such commitments have specified terms and conditions and are made for periods of up to 60 days, during which time the interest rate is locked in. Home Savings utilizes various hedge strategies to mitigate its interest rate risk during this time period. 
 At December 31, 2018, Home Savings’ one-to-four-family residential real estate loans held in portfolio totaled approximately $927.3 million, or 42.3% of total loans. At December 31, 2018, $4.2 million, or 0.4%, of Home Savings’ one-to-four-family loans were nonperforming. New originations in this loan category totaled $258.8 million in 2018. 
 Construction.  Home Savings originates loans for the construction of one-to-four-family residences.  These construction loans to owner-occupants are structured as permanent loans with fixed or adjustable rates of interest and terms of up to 30 years.  During the construction phase, the borrower is required to pay interest only.  These loans have LTVs at origination of up to 95% with appropriate mortgage insurance.  
 At December 31, 2018, Home Savings had approximately $141.7 million, or 6.5% of its total loans, invested in one-to-four-family residential construction loans.  All of these loans were performing according to the terms of their agreement as of December 31, 2018.  
 New originations for residential mortgage construction loans to owner-occupants totaled $272.4 million in 2018.  The level of new originations exceeded the outstanding balance of these loans as not all funds have been drawn on such loans as of December 31, 2018. 
 Consumer Loans:
 Home Savings originates various types of consumer loans, including home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, vehicle loans, unsecured loans, and cash-secured loans.  Home Savings generally does not originate recreational vehicle loans or marine loans. Consumer loans are made at fixed and variable rates of interest for different terms based on the type of loan. 
 Home Savings generally makes closed-end home equity loans and lines of credit in an amount that, when added to the prior indebtedness secured by the real estate, does not exceed 90% of the estimated value of the real estate. Home equity loans typically are secured by a second mortgage on the real estate. Home Savings frequently holds the first mortgage, although Home Savings will make home equity loans in cases where it sells the first mortgage or another lender holds the first mortgage. Home Savings also offers home equity lines of credit. Fixed-rate home equity loans typically have terms of ten years. Rate adjustments on adjustable home equity loans change based on the prime interest rate for loans on residences of up to 90% LTV regardless of lien position. At December 31, 2018, approximately $185.7 million, or 8.5%, of Home Savings’ total loan portfolio consisted of home equity loans. Home Savings also makes cash-secured consumer loans and investment-secured loans for up to 100% of the principal balance of the account. These loans generally have fixed rates tied to market conditions. 
 For new automobiles, loans are originated for up to 115% of the MSRP value of the car with terms of up to 78 months. For used automobiles, loans are made for up to the National Automobile Dealers Association (N.A.D.A.) retail value of the car model and a term of up to 78 months. Most automobile loans are originated indirectly through approved auto dealerships. At December 31, 2018, automobile loans totaled $78.7 million, or 3.6% of Home Savings’ total loan portfolio. 
 7


At December 31, 2018, Home Savings had approximately $277.0 million, or 12.7% of its total loans, invested in consumer loans. Nonperforming consumer loans at December 31, 2018, amounted to $1.7 million, or 0.6% of such loans. New originations of consumer loans totaled $99.7 million in 2018. 
 Lending Process:
 Loan Solicitation and Processing. The lending activities of Home Savings are subject to the written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures approved by Home Savings’ Board of Directors (the Board). Loan originations generally are obtained from existing customers and members of the local community and from referrals by real estate brokers, lawyers, accountants, builders and current and former customers. Home Savings also advertises in the local print media, radio television, billboards and online.
Each of Home Savings’ retail banking offices and residential mortgage loan centers have loan personnel who can accept loan applications, which are then forwarded to Home Savings’ Credit Department for processing and approval. In underwriting real estate loans, Home Savings typically obtains a credit report and verification of employment and analyzes the cash flows of the borrower and other documentation concerning the creditworthiness of the borrower. Typically, an appraisal of the fair market value of the real estate that will be given as security for the loan is prepared by an approved independent fee appraiser. For all nonresidential real estate loans, the appraisal is conducted by an outside fee appraiser whose report is reviewed by a third-party appraisal review firm engaged by Home Savings. Upon the completion of the appraisal and the receipt of information on the credit history of the borrower, the loan application is submitted for review to the appropriate persons. Generally, all commercial requests and consumer loan requests of $500,000 or more and residential mortgage loan requests over $800,000 up to and including $5.0 million require the approval of the Officers’ Loan Committee or the appropriate Officer’s Loan Committee member. All loans that would cause the aggregate lending relationship to be greater than $5.0 million require approval from the Executive Officers’ Loan Committee. 
 Borrowers are required to carry satisfactory fire and casualty insurance and flood insurance, if applicable, and to name Home Savings as an insured mortgagee. Home Savings generally obtains a title guarantee or title insurance on real estate loans. 
 The procedure for approval of construction loans is the same as for permanent real estate loans, except that an appraiser evaluates the building plans, construction specifications and estimates of construction costs. Home Savings also evaluates the feasibility of the proposed construction project and the experience and record of the builder. Once approved, the construction loan is disbursed in installments based upon periodic inspections of the construction progress and lien releases. 
 Consumer loans are underwritten based on the borrower’s credit history and an analysis of the borrower’s income and expenses, ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral, if any. 
 Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales. Home Savings’ residential loans generally are made on terms and conditions and documented to conform to the secondary market guidelines for sale to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and other institutional and private investors in the secondary market. Home Savings originates first mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Authority and the Veteran’s Administration with the intention to sell in the secondary market. 
 Home Savings generally retains the servicing rights on the sale of loans originated in the geographic area surrounding its full-service branches. Home Savings anticipates continued participation in the secondary mortgage loan market to maintain its desired risk profile. 
 At December 31, 2018, Home Savings had $26.8 million of outstanding commitments to make mortgage loans with the intention to sell in the secondary market, as well as $277.5 million available to borrowers under consumer and commercial lines of credit and $60.3 million available in the OverdraftPrivilege™ program. At December 31, 2018, Home Savings had $128.3 million in funds related to commercial loans in process and $71.4 million related to construction loans in process under existing contractual obligations.

Loans to One Borrower Limits. Regulations generally limit the aggregate amount that Home Savings may lend to any one borrower to an amount equal to 15.0% of Home Savings’ unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus (Lending Limit Capital). A bank may lend to one borrower an additional amount not to exceed 10.0% of Lending Limit Capital if the additional amount is fully secured by certain forms of readily marketable collateral. Real estate is not considered readily marketable collateral. In applying this limit, regulations require that loans to certain related or affiliated borrowers be aggregated. 
 Based on such limits, Home Savings could lend approximately $45.3 million to one borrower at December 31, 2018. The largest amount Home Savings had committed to one borrower at December 31, 2018, was $22.5 million in the form of three loans, of which $8.0 million was outstanding at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, these commercial real estate loans were performing in accordance with their terms. 
 Delinquent Loans, Nonperforming Assets and Classified Assets. The following table reflects the amount of all loans in a delinquent status as of the dates indicated:

Total delinquent loans | | 258 | | $ | 10,895 | | | 0.50 | % | | 317 | | $ | 16,657 | | 0.83 | %

 
Home Savings determines the past due status of loans based on the number of payments the loan is past due. 
 Nonperforming assets include loans past due 90 days and on a nonaccrual status, loans past due 90 days and still accruing, loans less than 90 days past due and on a nonaccrual status, real estate acquired by foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and repossessed assets. Once a loan becomes 90 days delinquent, it generally is placed on nonaccrual status. 
 Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when collection in full is considered by management to be in doubt. Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is charged against interest income. Subsequent cash payments received, if any, generally are applied to principal unless the remaining recorded investment in the asset (i.e., after charge-off of identified losses, if any) is deemed to be fully collectable. In those cases, subsequent cash payments are applied to principal and interest income in accordance with the original terms of the note. 
 Home Savings does not extend additional credit to borrowers whose loans are classified — i.e., loans that exhibit a well-defined weakness such that management determines that the loan should be classified as substandard, doubtful or loss — without approval by the applicable loan committee.

In 2018, net income did not include uncollected interest on nonperforming loans. During 2018, approximately $640,000 in additional interest income would have been recorded had nonaccrual loans been accruing pursuant to contractual terms. 
 A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that Home Savings will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the strength of guarantors (if any). Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances surrounding the loans and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis by the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent, the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or the market value of the loan. Home Savings considers all troubled debt restructured loans as impaired. 
 During 2018, Home Savings experienced a decline in impaired loans of $5.7 million. Home Savings recognized a decrease in nonperforming secured commercial loans of approximately $974,000. Nonperforming residential one-to-four-family and home equity loans declined $3.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively.  Purchased credit impaired loans decreased $1.2 million. 
 Real estate acquired in settlement of loans is classified separately on the balance sheet at estimated fair value less costs to sell as of the date of acquisition. At foreclosure, the loan is written down to the value of the underlying collateral by a charge to the allowance for loan losses, if necessary. Any subsequent write-downs are charged against operating expenses. Operating expenses of such properties, net of related income or loss on disposition, are included in real estate owned and other repossessed asset expenses. At December 31, 2018, the carrying value of real estate and other repossessed assets acquired in settlement of loans was $1.1 million and consisted primarily of $868,000 in one-to-four-family residential properties, $181,000 secured by one-to-four-family residential construction properties and $39,000 in automobiles and recreational vehicles.

In addition to the classified loans identified above, other loans may be identified as having potential credit problems as a result of those loans being identified by our internal loan review function. These special mention loans, which have not exhibited the more severe weaknesses generally present in classified loans, amounted to $23.3 million, as of December 31, 2018, compared to $15.8 million as of December 31, 2017. 
 Allowance for Loan Losses. Management has established a methodology to calculate the allowance for loan losses at a level it believes adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The methodology is reviewed regularly by the Board and is revised as conditions and circumstances within the Bank’s loan portfolio dictate. Management bases its determination of the adequacy of the allowance upon estimates derived from an analysis of individual credits, prior and current loss experience, loan portfolio delinquency levels, overall growth in the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and results of regulatory examinations. Furthermore, in determining the level of the allowance for loan losses, management reviews and evaluates on a monthly basis the necessity of a reserve for individual impaired loans classified by management. The specifically allocated reserve for a classified loan is determined based on management’s estimate of the borrower’s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral, market value of collateral, other sources of cash flow and legal options available to Home Savings. Once a review is completed, a specific reserve is determined and allocated to the loan. 
 Other loans not reviewed specifically by management are evaluated as a homogenous group of loans (generally single-family residential mortgage loans and all consumer credits except marine loans) using a loss factor applied to the outstanding loan balance to determine the level of reserve required. This loss factor consists of two components, a quantitative and a qualitative component. The quantitative component is based on a historical analysis of all charged-off loans, net of recoveries, looking back 26 quarters as of December 31, 2018.  In determining the qualitative component, consideration is given to such attributes as lending policies, economic conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio, management, loan quality trend, loan review, collateral value, concentrations, economic cycles and other external factors.   The quantitative and qualitative components are combined to arrive at the loss factor, which is applied to the average outstanding balance of homogenous loans.  At December 31, 2017, the Company evaluated 22 quarters of net charge-off history.    
 In determining the qualitative factors, consideration is given to such factors as economic conditions, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, lending personnel, lending policies, past-due loan trends, and trends in collateral values. Specific reserves on individual loans and historical ratios are reviewed periodically and adjusted as necessary based on subsequent collections, loan upgrades or downgrades, nonperforming trends or actual principal charge-offs. When evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, consideration is given to geographic concentrations and the effect that changing economic conditions have on Home Savings. These estimates are particularly susceptible to changes that could result in a material adjustment to results of operations. The provision for loan losses represents a charge against current earnings in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level. 
 The following table sets forth an analysis of Home Savings’ allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated:

At December 31, 2018, the allowance for loan losses was 0.93% of net loans and 312.6% of total nonperforming loans. 
 The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by category. The allocations are based on management’s assessment of the risk characteristics of each of the components of the total loan portfolio and are subject to change when the risk factors of each component change. The allocation is not indicative of either the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge-offs may be taken, nor should it be taken as an indicator of future loss trends. The allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future loss in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.

INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES 
 General. Investment securities are classified upon acquisition as available for sale, held to maturity or trading. Securities classified as available for sale are carried at estimated fair value with the unrealized holding gain or loss, net of taxes, reflected in other comprehensive income and as a component of shareholders’ equity. Securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. Securities classified as trading are carried at estimated fair value with the unrealized holding gain or loss reflected as a component of income. United Community and Home Savings recognize premiums and discounts in interest on the level yield method without anticipating prepayments and realized gains or losses on the sale of debt securities based on the amortized cost of the specific securities sold. 
 Home Savings Investment Activities. Federal laws and regulations as well as Ohio law permit Home Savings to invest in various types of marketable securities, including interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, federal funds, U.S. Treasury and agency obligations, mortgage-related securities and certain other specified investments. The Board has adopted an investment policy that authorizes management to make investments in U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. federal agency and federally-sponsored corporation obligations, mortgage-related securities issued or sponsored by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), investment-grade municipal obligations and creditworthy, unrated securities issued by municipalities in which Home Savings is located. Such securities comprised 100% of Home Savings’ investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2018. The investment policy also authorizes management to make investments in securities issued by private issuers, investment-grade corporate debt securities, investment-grade asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit that are fully-insured by the FDIC, bankers’ acceptances, federal funds and money market funds. Home Savings’ investment policy is designed primarily to provide and maintain liquidity within regulatory guidelines, to maintain a balance of high quality investments to minimize risk and to maximize return without sacrificing liquidity. 
 Home Savings maintains a significant portfolio of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations that are issued by Fannie Mae, GNMA and Freddie Mac. These securities generally entitle Home Savings to receive a portion of the cash flows from an identified pool of mortgages. Home Savings is exposed to prepayment risk and reinvestment risk to the extent that actual prepayments will differ from those estimated in pricing the security, which may result in adjustments to the net yield on such securities. Mortgage-related securities enable Home Savings to generate positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense and reduce credit risk due to either guarantees provided by the issuer or the high credit rating of the issuer. Mortgage-related securities classified as available for sale also provide Home Savings with an additional source of liquid funds. 
 United Community Investment Activities. Funds maintained by United Community for general corporate purposes primarily are invested in an account with Home Savings.

SOURCES OF FUNDS 
 General. Deposits traditionally have been the primary source of Home Savings’ funds for use in lending and other investment activities. In addition to deposits, Home Savings derives funds from interest payments and principal repayments on loans and income on other earning assets. Loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows fluctuate in response to general interest rates and money market conditions. Home Savings also may borrow from the FHLB and other suitable lenders as well as use repurchase agreements as sources of funds. 
 Deposits. Deposits are attracted principally from within Home Savings’ primary market area through the offering of a selection of deposit instruments, including checking accounts, regular savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties for the various types of accounts are monitored periodically by management. The amount of deposits from outside Home Savings’ primary market area is not significant. 
 Brokered deposits represent funds, which Home Savings obtained, directly or indirectly, through a deposit broker. A deposit broker places deposits from third parties with insured depository institutions or places deposits with an institution for the purpose of selling interest in those deposits to third parties. Home Savings had $291.0 million in brokered deposits at December 31, 2018 and $156.5 million in brokered deposits at December 31, 2017. 
 The following table sets forth the dollar amount of deposits in the various types of accounts offered by Home Savings at the dates indicated:

At December 31, 2018, approximately $663.8 million of Home Savings’ certificates of deposit will mature within one year. Based on past experience and Home Savings’ prevailing pricing strategies, management believes that a substantial percentage of such certificates will be renewed with Home Savings at maturity. If, however, Home Savings is unable to renew the maturing certificates for any reason, borrowings of up to $403.0 million, as of December 31, 2018, were available from the FHLB.

Borrowings. The FHLB system functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for its member institutions and certain other financial institutions. As a member in good standing of the FHLB, Home Savings is authorized to apply for advances, provided certain standards of creditworthiness have been met December 31, 2018 Home Savings may borrow up to an additional $403.0 million from the FHLB and had $243.0 million in outstanding advances at December 31, 2018. None of the advances outstanding are callable. 
COMPETITION 
 Home Savings faces competition for deposits and loans from other financial institutions, credit unions, online banks and mortgage originators in Home Savings’ primary market area. The primary factors in competition for deposits are customer service, convenience, interest rates and fees. Home Savings competes for loan originations primarily through the interest rates and loan fees it charges and through the efficiency and quality of service it provides to borrowers. Competition is affected by, among other things, the general availability of lendable funds, general and local economic conditions, current interest rate levels and other factors, which are not readily predictable.

EMPLOYEES 
 At December 31, 2018, United Community had 504 full-time equivalent employees.  Home Savings believes that relations with its employees are good. Home Savings makes available health, life and disability benefits, access to variable compensation and a 401(k) plan for its employees. 
REGULATION 
 
The following is a summary of certain statutes and regulations affecting United Community and Home Savings.  The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations. Applicable laws and regulations restrict permissible activities and investments, and require actions to protect loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary and other customers, as well as the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund.  
Financial Holding Company Regulation
 
United Community is a bank holding company that is qualified and has elected to be a financial holding company.  As a bank holding company, United Community is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act and to the reporting requirements of, and examination and regulation by, the FRB.  The FRB also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist or removal orders, and require that a bank holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries).  In general, the FRB may initiate enforcement action for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.
 
A bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support those subsidiary banks.  The FRB may require a bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidary bank and may disapprove of the payment of dividends to the shareholders of the bank holding company if the FRB believes the payment would be an unsafe or unsound practice.  The FRB also requires bank holding companies to provide advance notification of planned dividends under certain circumstances.
 
The Bank Holding Company Act requires the prior approval of the FRB in any case where a bank holding company proposes to:
 
 
• | acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank that is not already majority-owned by it; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | acquire substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company.
--+----------------------------------------------------------

Financial Holding Company Activities
 
United Community is a financial holding company, permitting it to engage in activities beyond those permitted for traditional bank holding companies.  In order to become a financial holding company, a bank holding company must meet certain capital requirements and be “well managed,” and all of its depository institutions must be “well capitalized” under federal banking regulations, and the depository institutions must have received a Community Reinvestment Act rating of at least satisfactory.
 
Financial holding companies may engage in a wide variety of financial activities, including any activity that the FRB and the Treasury Department consider financial in nature or incidental to financial activities, and any activity that the FRB determines complementary to a financial activity and which does not pose a substantial safety and soundness risk.  These activities include securities underwriting and dealing activities, insurance and underwriting activities and merchant banking/equity investment activities.  Because it has authority to engage in a broad array of financial activities, a financial holding company may have affiliates that are functionally regulated by financial regulators other than the FRB, such as the SEC and state insurance regulators. 
 
A financial holding company and its subsidiaries must continue to meet the above described requirements in order to continue to engage in activities that are financial in nature without being subjected to regulatory actions or restrictions, which could include a requirement to divest of the subsidiary or subsidiaries.  If a financial holding company or a subsidiary bank fails to meet the requirements for the holding company to remain a financial holding company, the financial holding company must enter into a written agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements.  Until the FRB determines that the holding company and its subsidiary banks meet the requirements, the FRB may impose additional limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the financial holding company or any affiliate that the FRB finds to be appropriate or consistent with federal banking laws.  If the deficiencies are not corrected, the financial holding company may be required to divest ownership or control of some or all of its subsidiaries.  If restrictions are imposed on the activities of the holding company, such restrictions may not be made publicly available pursuant to confidentiality regulations of the banking regulators.

The Home Savings Insurance Group is supervised and regulated by the State of Ohio Department of Insurance.  The insurance laws and regulations applicable to insurance agencies require education and licensing of individual agents and agencies require reports and impose business conduct rules.  
 
Regulation of Ohio State-Chartered Banks
 
As an Ohio state-chartered bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, Home Savings is supervised and regulated primarily by the ODFI and the FDIC.  Home Savings’ deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC, and Home Savings is subject to the applicable provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and other regulations of the FDIC.  Home Savings is also subject to the regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has broad authority to adopt and enforce consumer protection regulations.
 
Various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the United States and the State of Ohio affect the operations of Home Savings, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged thereon, restrictions relating to investments and other activities, limitations on credit exposure to correspondent banks, limitations on activities based on capital and surplus, limitations on payment of dividends, limitations on branching and increasingly extensive consumer protection laws and regulations.  
 
Consumer protection laws and regulations include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act (prohibiting certain types of discriminatory lending practices), the Truth in Lending Act (requiring understandable disclosure of credit terms), the Home Mortgage Dislcosure Act (requiring the collection of data that enables regulatory agencies to determine whether the financial insitutions are serving the housing credit needs of the communities in which they are located), the Real Estate Seteelement Procedures Act (requiring disclosures to borrowers and prohibiting abusive practices that increase borrowers’ costs) and the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (requiring policies and procedures to restrict unauthorized sharing of non-public customer data with nonaffiliated parties and protecting customer information from unauthorized access).  The banking regulators also use their authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices by banks that may not necessarily fall within the scope of specific banking or consumer finance law.
 
In 2017, the State of Ohio completed a substantial re-writing of Ohio’s banking laws that became effective on January 1, 2018.  The law adopted one universal bank charter for depository institutions chartered by the state, rather than having separate types of state depository institution charters with different powers and limitations for banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations.  The result is that all Ohio-chartered depository institutions are now considered to have full commercial bank powers, unless an institution elects to continue to be governed by federal restrictions applicable to federal savings and loan associations and federal savings banks.  While the most substantial changes in the law affect institutions chartered by Ohio as savings banks or savings and loan associations prior to the effectiveness of the new law, some changes also apply to institutions, like Home Savings, that were chartered as commercial banks prior to the change in the law.  The changes for all Ohio-chartered banks include provisions allowing Ohio-chartered banks to exercise the same powers, perform all acts, and provide all services that are permitted for federally chartered depository institutions, with the exception of laws and regulations dealing with interest rates, thereby enhancing opportunities for Ohio-chartered banks to compete with other financial institutions.  Other provisions clarify previous laws addressing, or allow more flexibility with respect to, corporate governance matters, mergers and acquisitions and additional reliance on Ohio corporate law generally. 
 In addition, in October 2017, Ohio-chartered banks received notices of required assessments to be paid to the ODFI after two years without assessments while the ODFI was funded by State of Ohio excess unclaimed funds allocated to the ODFI by the State of Ohio.  
 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act
 On May 25, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”) was signed into law. The Regulatory Relief Act was designed to provide regulatory relief for banking organizations, particularly for all but the very largest, those with assets in excess of $250 billion. Bank holding companies with assets of less than $100 billion are no longer subject to enhanced prudential standards, and those with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion will be relieved of those requirements in 18 months, unless the FRB takes action to maintain those standards. Certain regulatory requirements applied only to banks with assets in excess of $50 billion and so did not apply to United Community even before the enactment of the Regulatory Relief Act.
 17


The Regulatory Relief Act also provides that the banking regulators must adopt regulations implementing the provision that banking organizations with assets of less than $10 billion are permitted to satisfy capital standards and be considered “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework if their leverage ratios of tangible assets to average consolidated assets is between 8%and 10%, unless the bank’s federal banking agency determines that the organization’s risk profile warrants a more stringent leverage ratio. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the FRB and the FDIC have proposed for comment the leverage ratio framework for any banking organization with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, limited amounts of certain types of assets and off-balance sheet exposures, and a community bank leverage ratio greater than 9%. The community bank leverage ratio would be calculated as the ratio of tangible equity capital divided by average total consolidated assets. Tangible equity capital would be defined as total bank equity capital or total holding company equity capital, as applicable, prior to including minority interests, and excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, goodwill and other intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing assets). Average total assets would be calculated in a manner similar to the current tier 1 leverage ratio denominator in that amounts deducted from the community bank leverage ratio numerator would also be excluded from the community bank leverage ratio denominator.
 The OCC, the FRB and the FDIC also adopted a rule providing banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of new current expected credit loss methodology accounting under U. S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
 The Regulatory Relief Act also relieves bank holding companies and banks with assets of less than $100 billion in assets from certain record-keeping, reporting and disclosure requirements.
 
Capital Requirements
 
Financial institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain capital as a way of absorbing losses that can, as well as losses that cannot, be predicted.  The FRB has adopted risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies, and the FDIC has adopted risk-based capital guidelines for state banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System.  The guidelines provide a systematic analytical framework which makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures expressly into account in evaluating capital adequacy and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets.  Capital levels as measured by these standards are also used to categorize financial institutions for purposes of certain prompt corrective action regulatory provisions. 
 The risk-based capital guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies are based on the “International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standard” (Basel I), published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee).  New capital rules applicable to smaller banking organizations (Basel III Capital Rules), which also implement certain of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), became effective on January 1, 2015.  Compliance with the new minimum capital requirements was required effective on January 1, 2015, whereas a new capital conservation buffer and deductions from common equity capital phased in from January 1, 2016, through January 1, 2019, and most deductions from common equity tier 1 capital have mostly phased in as of January 1, 2019.
 The rules include (a) a minimum common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent, (b) a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0 percent, (c) a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 percent, and (d) a minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average assets) of 4%.
 Common equity for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio includes common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, plus limited amounts of minority interests in the form of common stock, less the majority of certain regulatory deductions.         
 Tier 1 capital includes common equity as defined for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, plus certain non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, cumulative preferred stock and related surplus and trust preferred securities that have been grandfathered (but which are not permitted going forward), and limited amounts of minority interests in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, less certain deductions.
 Tier 2 capital, which can be included in the total capital ratio, includes certain capital instruments (such as subordinated debt) and limited amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to new eligibility criteria, less applicable deductions.
 The deductions from common equity tier 1 capital include goodwill and other intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, mortgage-servicing assets above certain levels, gains on sale in connection with a securitization, investments in a banking organization’s own capital instruments and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (above certain levels).  
 18


Under the guidelines, capital is compared to the relative risk related to the balance sheet.  To derive the risk included in the balance sheet, one of several risk weights is applied to different balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets, primarily based on the relative credit risk of the counterparty.  The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.  
 The rules also place restrictions on the payment of capital distributions, including dividends, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the company does not hold a capital conservation buffer of greater than 2.5 percent composed of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements, or if its eligible retained income is negative in that quarter and its capital conservation buffer ratio was less than 2.5 percent at the beginning of the quarter.  The capital conservation buffer phases in starting on January 1, 2016, at .625% and is fully phased in at 2.50%.  The implementation of Basel III is not expected to have a material impact on United Community’s or Home Savings’ capital ratios.
 Federal banking regulators have established regulations governing prompt corrective action to resolve capital deficient banks.  Under these regulations, institutions which become undercapitalized become subject to mandatory regulatory scrutiny and limitations, which increase as capital continues to decrease.  Such institutions are also required to file capital plans with their primary federal regulator, and their holding companies must guarantee the capital shortfall up to 5% of the assets of the capital deficient institution at the time it becomes undercapitalized.
 Effective January 1, 2015, in order to be “well-capitalized,” a bank must have a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8% and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and the bank must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level or any capital measure.  United Community’s management believes that Home Savings meets the ratio requirements to be deemed “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action regulations.  
 A bank with a capital level that might qualify for well-capitalized or adequately-capitalized status may nevertheless be treated as though the bank is in the next lower capital category if the bank’s primary federal banking supervisory authority determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or practice warrants that treatment.  A bank’s operations can be significantly affected by its capital classification under the prompt corrective action rules.  For example, a bank that is not well capitalized generally is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market without advance regulatory approval.  These deposit-funding limitations can have an adverse effect on the bank’s liquidity.  At each successively lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to additional restrictions.  Undercapitalized banks are required to take specified actions to increase their capital or otherwise decrease the risks to the federal deposit insurance fund. Bank regulatory agencies generally are required to appoint a receiver or conservator within 90 days after a bank becomes critically undercapitalized, with a leverage ratio of less than 2%.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that a federal bank regulatory authority may require a bank holding company to divest itself of an undercapitalized bank subsidiary if the agency determines that divestiture will improve the bank’s financial condition and prospects. 
 Regulations of the FRB require a financial holding company to maintain total risk-based capital of 10.0% and Tier 1 risk-based capital of 6.0%.  
 
Limits on Dividends
 The ability of a bank holding company to obtain funds for the payment of dividends and for other cash requirements is largely dependent on the amount of dividends that may be declared by its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries.  However, the FRB expects a bank holding company to serve as a source of strength to its bank subsidiaries, which may require the holding company to retain capital for further investments in its bank subsidiaries, rather than paying dividends to shareholders of the holding company.  Home Savings may not pay dividends to United Community if, after paying such dividends, it would fail to meet the required capital levels.  Dividends are also subject to limitations if United Community or Home Savings fails to hold the required capital conservation buffer.  Home Savings must have the approval of its regulatory authorities if a dividend in any year would cause the total dividends for that year to exceed the sum of its current year’s net profits and retained net profits for the preceding two years, less required transfers to surplus.  Under Ohio law, Home Savings may pay a dividend from surplus only with the approval of its shareholder United Community and the approval of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions.  Payment of dividends by Home Savings may be restricted at any time at the discretion of its regulatory authorities, if they deem such dividends to constitute an unsafe and/or unsound banking practice or if necessary to maintain adequate capital for Home Savings.  These provisions could have the effect of limiting United Community’s ability to pay dividends on its outstanding common shares.
 In addition, FRB policy requires United Community to provide notice to the FRB in advance of the payment of a dividend to United Community’s shareholders under certain circumstances, and states that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings.  The FRB may disapprove of such dividend payment if the FRB determines the payment would be an unsafe or unsound practice.
 19


Deposit Insurance Assessments
 The FDIC is an independent federal agency which insures deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, of federally-insured banks and savings associations and safeguards the safety and soundness of the financial institution industry.  The deposits of Home Savings are insured up to statutorily prescribed limits by the FDIC, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor.     
 As insurer as well as primary federal regulator of Home Savings, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by Home Savings, to prohibit Home Savings from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines to pose a threat to the Deposit Insurance Fund, and to take enforcement actions against Home Savings.  The FDIC may terminate insurance of deposits of any institution if it finds that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC or other regulatory agency.    
 The FDIC assesses a quarterly deposit insurance premium on each insured institution based on risk characteristics of the institution and may also impose special assessments in emergency situations.  The premiums fund the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF).  Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio (DRR), which is the amount in the DIF as a percentage of all DIF insured deposits.  In March 2016, the FDIC adopted final rules designed to meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets of less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%.  Although the FDIC's new rules reduced assessment rates on all banks, they imposed a surcharge on banks with assets of $10 billion or more to be paid until the DRR reaches 1.35%.  The DRR reached 1.36% at September 30, 2018.  The rules also provide assessment credits to banks with assets of less than $10 billion for the portion of their assessments that contribute to the increase of the DRR to 1.35%.  The rules further changed the method of determining risk-based assessment rates for established banks with less than $10 billion in assets to better ensure that banks taking on greater risks pay more for deposit insurance than banks that take on less risk.  
 In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, which was established by the government to recapitalize a predecessor to the DIF.  These assessments will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in September 2019.  The Financing Corporation has projected that the last assessment will be collected on the March 29, 2019, FDIC invoice.  
 Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations
 Banks are subject to regular examination to ensure compliance with federal statutes and regulations applicable to their business, including consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations. Potential penalties under these laws include, but are not limited to, fines. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has adopted numerous rules with respect to consumer protection laws, amending some existing regulations and adopting new ones, and has commenced enforcement actions. The following are just some of the consumer protection laws applicable to the Bank:

• | Community Reinvestment Act of 1977: imposes a continuing and affirmative obligation to fulfill the credit needs of its entire community, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act: prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction on the basis of any of various criteria.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Truth in Lending Act: requires that credit terms are disclosed in a manner that permits a consumer to understand and compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fair Housing Act: makes it unlawful for a lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person on the basis of any of certain criteria.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act: requires financial institutions to collect data that enables regulatory agencies to determine whether the financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the communities in which they are located.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act: requires that lenders provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements and prohibits abusive practices that increase borrowers’ costs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: requires financial institutions to establish policies and procedures to restrict the sharing of non-public customer data with non-affiliated parties and to protect customer information from unauthorized access.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The banking regulators also use their authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices by banks that may not necessarily fall within the scope of specific banking or consumer finance law.
 In October 2017, the CFPB issued a final rule (the “Payday Rule”) with respect to certain consumer loans to be effective on January 16, 2018, although compliance with most sections is required starting on August 19, 2019. The first major part of the rule makes it an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make short-term and longer-term loans with balloon payments (with certain exceptions) without reasonably determining that the borrower has the ability to repay the loan. The second major part of the rule applies to the same types of loans as well as certain other longer-term loans that are repaid directly from the borrower's account. The rule states that it is an unfair and abusive practice for the lender to withdraw payment from the borrower's account after two consecutive payment attempts have failed, unless the lender obtains the consumer's new and specific authorization to make further withdrawals from the account. The rule also requires lenders to provide certain notices to the borrower before attempting to withdraw payment on a covered loan from the borrower’s account.  
 On February 6, 2019, the CFPB issued two proposals with respect to the Payday Rule. First, the CFPB proposed to delay the compliance date for the mandatory underwriting provisions of the Payday Rule to November 19, 2020. It has requested comments on the proposed delay to be made within 30 days. Second, the CFPB proposed to rescind provisions of the Payday Rule that (1) provide that it is an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make a covered short-term or longer-term balloon-payment loan without reasonably determining that the consumer has the ability to repay the loan according to its terms; (2) prescribe mandatory underwriting requirements for making the ability-to-repay determination; (3) provide exemptions of certain loans from the mandatory underwriting requirements; and (4) provide related definitions, reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The CFPB has requested comments to be made within 90 days on this proposal. These proposals do not change the provisions of the Payday Rule that address lender payment practices with respect to covered loans. The CFPB also stated that it will be considering other changes to the Payday Rule in response to requests received for exemptions of certain types of lenders or loan products and may commence separate additional rulemaking initiatives.  The Payday Rule applies to short-term loans that have terms of 45 days or less, longer-term balloon-payment loans and longer-term loans that have a cost of credit exceeding 36% per annum and for which the lender obtains a leveraged payment mechanism.  Of these loan types, the Company does not offer either short-term loans that have terms of 45 days or less or longer-term balloon-payment loans.  The Company may occasionally offer, on an accommodation basis, vehicle title loans, which qualify as longer-term loans which may have a cost of credit exceeding 36% per annum for which the Company obtains a leveraged payment mechanism.  However, the Rule provides a conditional exemption for accommodation loans provided the lender and its affiliates have made 2,500 or fewer of these loans in the current year and have made 2,500 or fewer of these loans in the preceding calendar year.  Based upon this information, the Payday Rule will have no impact on the Company.
 Transactions with Affiliates, Directors, Executive Officers and Shareholders
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Act applies to state-chartered non-member banks Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W, which restrict transactions by banks and their subsidiaries with their affiliates.  An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity which controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank.  Generally, Sections 23A and 23B and Regulation W:  

• | limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of that bank’s capital stock and surplus (i.e., tangible capital);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with all affiliates to 20% of that bank’s capital stock and surplus; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank subsidiary, as those provided to a non-affiliate.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to the affiliate, the purchase of assets from the affiliate, the issuance of a guarantee on behalf of the affiliate, the purchase of securities issued by the affiliate, and other similar types of transactions.  
 Home Savings’ authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders, as well as entities such persons control, is subject to limits established by FDIC regulations, which incorporate by reference most of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated thereunder by the Federal Reserve Board.  Among other restrictions, these loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals or be made as part of a benefit or compensation program and on terms widely available to employees, and must not involve a greater than normal risk of repayment.  In

addition, the amount of loans a bank may make to these persons is based, in part, on the bank’s capital position, and specified approval procedures must be followed.
 Monetary Policy and Economic Conditions
 The business of commercial banks is affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities, including the FRB.  The FRB regulates the money and credit conditions and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions primarily through open market operations in U.S. Government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits.  These policies and regulations significantly influence the amount of bank loans and deposits and the interest rates charged and paid thereon, and thus have an effect on earnings. 
Patriot Act
 The Uniting and Strengthening of America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorist Act of 2001 (Patriot Act) gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through domestic security measures, surveillance powers, information sharing and anti-money laundering requirements.  Title III of the Patriot Act takes measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies.  Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions.  Among other requirements, Title III and related regulations require regulated financial institutions to establish a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts and establish due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report suspicious activity.  
Executive and Incentive Compensation
 In June 2010, the FRB, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued joint interagency guidance on incentive compensation policies (Joint Guidance) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking.  This principles-based guidance, which covers all employees who have the ability to affect materially the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should:  (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks; (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors.  The Joint Guidance made incentive compensation part of the regulatory agencies’ examination process, with the findings of the supervisory initiatives included in reports of examination and enforcement actions possible.
 After issuing proposed rules in 2011, in May 2016, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved their second joint notice of proposed rules (Second Proposed Joint Rules) designed to prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks at financial institutions.  The requirements of the Second Proposed Joint Rules would differ for each of three categories of financial institutions:  
  
• | Level 1 consists of institutions with assets of $250 billion or more;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Level 2 consists of institutions with assets of at least $50 billion and less than $250 billion; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Level 3 consists of institutions with assets of at least $1 billion and less than $50 billion.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some of the requirements would apply only to Level 1 and Level 2 institutions.  For all covered institutions the Second Proposed Joint Rules would prohibit certain practices and types of incentive compensation and:
  
• | prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that are “excessive” or “could lead to material financial loss;”
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require incentive based compensation that is consistent with a balance of risk and reward, effective management and control of risk, and effective governance; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require board oversight, recordkeeping and disclosure to the appropriate regulatory agency.
