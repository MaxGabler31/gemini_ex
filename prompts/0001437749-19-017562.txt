ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
Overview
 
We provide authentication and grading services to dealers and collectors of coins, trading cards, event tickets, autographs and historical and sports memorabilia (“collectibles”). We believe that our authentication and grading services add value to these collectibles by enhancing their marketability and thereby providing increased liquidity to the dealers, collectors and consumers that own and buy and sell them.
 
Once we have authenticated and assigned a quality grade to a collectible, we encapsulate it in a tamper-evident, clear plastic holder, or issue a certificate of authenticity, that (i) identifies the specific collectible; (ii) sets forth the quality grade we have assigned to it; and (iii) bears one of our brand names and logos: “PCGS” for coins, “PSA” for trading cards and event tickets and “PSA/DNA” for autographs and memorabilia. Additionally, we warrant our certification of authenticity and the quality grades that we assign to the coins and trading cards that we authenticate and grade. We do not warrant our authenticity determinations for autographs or memorabilia. For ease of reference in this Annual Report, we will sometimes refer to coins, trading cards and other collectibles that we have authenticated or graded as having been “certified.”
 
We generate revenues principally from the fees paid for our authentication and grading services. To a much lesser extent, we generate revenues from other related revenues, which consist of (i) the sale of advertising and click-through commissions earned on our websites, (ii) the sale of printed publications and collectibles price guides and advertising in such publications; (iii) the sale of membership subscriptions in our Collectors Club, which is designed to attract interest in high-value collectibles among new collectors; (iv) the sale of subscriptions to our Certified Coin Exchange (CCE) dealer-to-dealer Internet bid-ask market for certified coins, which offers a comprehensive one-stop source for historical U.S. numismatic information and value-added content; and (v) collectibles trade shows that we operate, at which primarily coins are exhibited and are bought and sold by collectibles dealers and collectors. We also generate revenues from sales of our collectibles inventory, which is comprised primarily of collectible coins that we have purchased under our coin grading warranty program; however, those sales are not the focus, and we do not consider them to be an integral part of, our ongoing revenue-generating activities.

We have developed some of the leading brands in the collectibles markets in which we conduct our business:
 

■ | “PCGS” (Professional Coin Grading Service), which is the brand name for our independent coin authentication and grading service;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | “PSA” (Professional Sports Authenticator), which is the brand name for our independent sports and trading cards authentication and grading service;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | “PSA/DNA” (PSA/DNA Authentication Services), which is the brand name for our independent authentication and grading service for vintage autographs and memorabilia.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
PCGS, PSA and PSA/DNA are among the leading independent authentication and grading services in their respective markets.
 
We foster brand loyalty and stimulate demand for our services by providing information and value added content to collectors and dealers through various means including our CCE websites, Collectors Clubs, Set RegistrySM programs, Collectors.com, CoinFacts and PSA Collectibles Facts, collectibles population reports and price guides. We believe that by providing this information and content we generate more knowledgeable and active collectors and dealers.
 
We began offering our PCGS coin authentication and grading services in 1986 and, from inception through the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we have authenticated and graded approximately 41 million coins. In 1991, we launched our PSA trading cards authentication and grading service and, through June 30, 2019, had authenticated and graded approximately 35 million trading cards. In 1999, we launched our PSA/DNA vintage autograph authentication business and in June 2004 we extended that business by introducing vintage autograph grading services to dealers and collectors of autographed sports memorabilia.
 
Our revenues are comprised principally of our authentication and grading service fees.  Those fees range from $1 to $15,000 but averaged $13.39 per item, based primarily on the type of collectible authenticated or graded, the turnaround times and the specific service selected by the customer.  We charge higher fees for faster turnaround times.  In fiscal 2019, our coin authentication and grading fees ranged from $1 to $15,000, and averaged $17.18, per coin. In the case of trading cards, in fiscal 2019, the authentication and grading fees ranged from approximately $1 to $5,000 and averaged $9.36, per trading card.  As a general rule, collectibles dealers and, to a lesser extent, individual collectors, request faster turnaround times and, therefore, generally pay higher fees for more valuable, older or “vintage” collectibles than they do for modern collectibles. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: Factors that can Affect our Revenues below.

Industry Background
 
The primary determinants of the prices of, and the willingness of sellers, purchasers and collectors to purchase high-value or high-priced collectibles, are their authenticity, quality and rarity. The authenticity of a collectible relates not only to the genuineness of the collectible, but also to the absence of any alterations or repairs that may have been made to hide, damage or to restore the item. The quality of a collectible relates to its state of preservation relative to its original state of manufacture or creation. The rarity of a collectible relates to its uniqueness and depends primarily on the number of identical collectibles of equivalent or better quality that become available for purchase from time to time. With regard to value, confirmation of authenticity generally is required before a buyer is willing to proceed with a purchase of a high-priced collectible. Quality and rarity directly affect value and price, with higher quality and rare collectibles generally attracting dramatically higher prices than those of lower quality and lesser rarity. Even a relatively modest difference in quality can translate into a significant difference in perceived value and, therefore, in price.
 
Until the advent of independent third-party authentication and grading, most prospective buyers, including experienced collectibles dealers and retailers, insisted on physically examining high-priced collectibles before consummating transactions. However, unlike professionals in the trade, most purchasers and collectors lacked the experience and knowledge needed to determine, with confidence, the authenticity, quality or rarity, and hence the value, of high-priced collectibles, even when they had the opportunity to examine them physically. Therefore, they had to rely on representations made by sellers regarding authenticity, quality and rarity. For these reasons, “buyer beware” characterized the high-value collectibles markets, and “sight-unseen” markets for rare coins and other high-value collectibles were practically non-existent.
 
High-value collectibles have been traditionally marketed at retail by dealers through direct mail, catalogues, price lists and advertisements in trade publications, and sold and purchased by them at collectibles shows, auction houses and local dealer shops. These markets were highly inefficient because:
 

■ | they were fragmented and localized, which limited both the variety of available collectibles and the number of potential buyers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | transaction costs were often relatively high due to the number of intermediaries involved;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | buyers usually lacked the information needed to determine the authenticity and quality and, hence the value, of the collectibles being sold; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | buyers and sellers were vulnerable to fraudulent practices because they had to rely on the dealers or other sellers for opinions or representations as to authenticity, quality and rarity.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coin Market. In an effort to overcome some of these inefficiencies, approximately 40 years ago, professional coin dealers began using a numerical quality grading scale for coins. That scale ranged from 1 to 70, with higher numbers denoting a higher quality. Previously, professional dealers used descriptive terms, such as “Fair,” “Fine” and “Uncirculated,” to characterize the quality of the coins they sold, a practice that continued after the development of the numeric grading system. However, whether using a numeric or a descriptive system, grading standards varied significantly from dealer to dealer, depending on a dealer’s subjective criteria of quality. Moreover, dealers were hardly disinterested or independent since, as the sellers or buyers of the coins they were grading, they stood to benefit financially from the assignment of a particular grade.
Trading Cards Market. Misrepresentations of authenticity, quality and rarity also operated as a barrier to the liquidity and growth of the collectibles market for trading cards. Even experienced and knowledgeable dealers insisted on physically examining purportedly rare and higher-priced trading cards. Most collectors lacked the knowledge needed to purchase collectible trading cards with confidence, even when they had physically examined them. Trading card dealers eventually developed a rudimentary adjectival system to provide measures of quality, using descriptive terms such as “Poor,” “Very Good,” “Mint” and “Gem Mint.” These measures of quality were assigned on the basis of such characteristics as the centering of the image on the card and the presence or absence of bent or damaged corners, scratches and color imperfections. However, as was the case with coins, grading standards varied significantly from dealer to dealer, depending on a dealer’s subjective criteria of quality. Additionally, since the dealers who bought and sold trading cards were the ones that assigned these grades, collectors remained vulnerable to misrepresentations as to the authenticity, quality and rarity of trading cards being sold or purchased by dealers.

Autographed Memorabilia Market. The market for autographed sports, entertainment and historical memorabilia has been plagued by a high incidence of forgeries and misrepresentations of authenticity. For example, Operation Bullpen, initiated by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies beginning in 1997, uncovered a high volume of outright forgeries of signatures and widespread misrepresentations as to the genuineness of sports memorabilia. We believe that the high incidence of such fraudulent activities was due, in large part, to a dearth of independent third-party memorabilia authentication services and an absence of systematic methodologies and specimen data needed for verification of authenticity.
 
These conditions created a need and the demand for independent authentication and grading services from which sellers, purchasers and collectors could obtain:
 

■ | determinations, from independent, third-party experts, of the authenticity of the high-value collectibles that are sold and purchased by dealers and collectors, particularly “sight-unseen” or over the Internet;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | representations of quality based on uniform standards consistently applied by independent, third-party experts; and 
■ | authoritative information, compiled by a credible third party, to help purchasers and collectors understand the factors that affect an item’s perceived value and price, including: 


— | its rarity; 
--+------------------------------------------
— | its quality or grade; and 
— | its historical and recent selling prices.

 
The Impact of eBay and Other e-Commerce Websites on the Collectible Markets. The advent of the Internet and, in particular, eBay’s development of an Internet or “virtual” marketplace and other Internet-selling websites, such as Amazon, have overcome many of the inefficiencies that had characterized the traditional collectibles markets. eBay and other online marketplaces (i) offer enhanced interaction between and greater convenience for sellers and buyers of high-value collectibles; (ii) eliminate or reduce the involvement of dealers and other “middlemen;” (iii) reduce transaction costs; (iv) allow trading to be conducted at all hours; and (v) regularly provide updated information to collectors. In addition, in August 2015, the Company launched its Collectors.com website where it aggregates and organizes collectibles listings from sellers and collectibles categories and markets; to enable collectors to expeditiously locate collectibles they are interested in buying. However, Internet commerce still raises, and has even heightened, concerns about the authenticity and quality of the collectibles that are listed for sale on the Internet. Buyers have no ability to physically examine the collectibles and no means to confirm the identity or the credibility of the dealers or sellers on the Internet. As a result, we believe that the growth of Internet-selling websites, such as eBay and Amazon, and individual dealer-owned websites, has increased awareness of the importance of, and the demand for, independent third-party authentication and grading services of the type we provide. Our services enable purchasers and collectors to use the Internet to purchase high-value collectibles, without physical examination (“sight-unseen”), with the confidence of knowing that they are authentic and are of the quality represented by sellers. The importance and value of our services to purchasers and collectors, we believe, are demonstrated by eBay’s inclusion, on its collectibles websites, of information that identifies, and encourages visitors to use, our independent third-party authentication and grading services, as well as similar services offered by some of our competitors.
 
Our Services
 
PCGS Coin Authentication and Grading Services. Recognizing the need for third-party authentication and grading services, we launched Professional Coin Grading Service in 1986. PCGS employs or retains the services of expert coin graders, who are independent of coin buyers and sellers, to provide impartial authentication and grading services. We also established uniform standards of quality measured against an actual “benchmark” set of coins kept at our offices. We place each coin that we authenticate and grade in a tamper-evident, clear plastic holder which bears our logo, so that any prospective buyer will know that it is a PCGS authenticated and graded coin. We also provide a warranty as to the accuracy of our coin authentication and grading determinations. As of June 30, 2019, we employed or retained the services of 39 coin experts who have an average of 11 years of service with the Company.

By providing an independent assessment by coin experts of the authenticity and quality of coins, we believe that PCGS has increased the liquidity of the trading market for collectible coins. Following the introduction of our independent, third-party authentication and grading service, buyer confidence, even between dealers, increased to such a degree that coins authenticated and graded by PCGS were able to be traded “sight-unseen.” In 1990, a dealer market was developed, known as the “Certified Coin Exchange,” on which coin dealers trade rare coins “sight-unseen.” We acquired CCE in 2005.
 
Our coin authentication and grading services have facilitated the development of a growing Internet or “virtual” marketplace for collectible coins. A prospective buyer, who might otherwise be reluctant to purchase a high-priced coin listed “sight-unseen” on the Internet, is able to rely on a PCGS certification, as well as authoritative information about the coin that is accessible on our website, in deciding whether or not to bid and in determining the amount to offer for the coin. As a result, to enhance the marketability of higher-priced coins, many sellers submit their coins to PCGS for authentication and grading. That enables the sellers to include, in their Internet sales listings, digital images of the coins in their tamper-evident, clear plastic holders, which identify the coins as having been authenticated and graded by PCGS, as well as their PCGS-assigned grades. We also provide a range of authoritative content on coin collecting to inform and communicate with the collector community, including guides and reports that track the trading prices and the rarity of PCGS-graded coins.
 
PSA Trading Card Authentication and Grading Services. Leveraging the credibility and using the methodologies that we had established with PCGS in the coin market, in 1991 we launched Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA), which instituted a similar authentication and grading system for trading cards. We are now the leading authenticator and grader of trading cards. Our independent trading card experts certify the authenticity of and assign quality grades to trading cards using a numeric system with a scale from 1-to-10 that we developed, together with an adjectival system to describe their condition. At June 30, 2019, we employed 27 experts who have an average of 14 years of service with the Company. We believe that our authentication and grading services have removed barriers that were created by the historical seller-biased grading process and, thereby, have improved the overall marketability of and facilitated commerce in trading cards, including over the Internet and at telephonic sports memorabilia auctions.
 
The trading cards submitted to us for authentication and grading include primarily (i) older or vintage trading cards, particularly of memorable or historically famous players, such as Honus Wagner, Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams and Mickey Mantle, and (ii) modern or newly produced trading cards of current or new athletes who have become popular with sports fans or have achieved new records or milestones, such as Derek Jeter, Albert Pujols, Mariano Rivera and Miguel Cabrera. These trading cards have, or are perceived to have, sufficient collectible value and are sold more frequently than are trading cards of less notable athletes, leading dealers and collectors to submit them for grading to enhance their marketability. Also, the production and sale of each new series of trading cards, which take place at the beginning and during the course of each new sports season, create new collectibles that provide a source of future additional authentication and grading submissions to us.
 
PSA/DNA Autograph Authentication and Grading Services. In 1999, we launched our vintage autograph authentication business, initially offering authentication services for “vintage” sports autographs and memorabilia that were autographed or signed prior to the time they were presented to us for authentication. The vintage autograph authentication business is distinctly different from the “signed-in-the-presence” authentication of autographs where an “authenticator” is present and witnesses the actual signing. Our vintage autograph authentication service involves the rendering of an opinion of authenticity by an industry expert based on (i) an analysis of the signed object, such as the signed document or autographed item of memorabilia, to confirm its consistency with similar materials or items that existed during the signer’s lifetime; (ii) a comparison of the signature submitted for authentication with exemplars of such signatures; and (iii) a handwriting analysis. As of June 30, 2019, we employed five autograph experts, as well as outside consultants that we sometimes use on a contract basis.
 
In June 2004, we also began offering grading services for autographs, beginning with baseballs containing a single signature or autograph. We use uniform grading standards that we have developed and a numeric scale of 1-to-10, with the highest number representing top quality or “Gem Mint” condition. We assign grades to the collectibles based on the physical condition or state of preservation of the autograph.

CCE Certified Coin Exchange and Collectors Corner. In September 2005, we acquired the Certified Coin Exchange (CCE), a subscription-based, business-to-business Internet bid-ask market for coins that have been certified by us or by other independent coin authentication and grading services. The CCE website now features over 100,000 bid and ask prices for certified coins at www.certifiedcoinexchange.com. CCE, since 1990, has provided liquidity in the geographically dispersed and highly fragmented market for rare coins. In March 2007, we introduced the Collectors Corner, a business-to-consumer website that enables sellers on CCE to offer many certified coins simultaneously at wholesale prices on CCE and at retail prices on Collectors Corner (www.collectorscorner.com). Registration on Collectors Corner is free for consumers, who can search for and sort coins listed on the Collectors Corner website. Coin sellers must register and pay a fixed monthly subscription fee to us for access to and to effectuate sale transactions on both CCE and Collectors Corner. Currently, there are over 160,000 collectibles, consisting primarily of coins, trading cards, currency and stamps, which are offered for sale on Collectors Corner, with offering prices aggregating approximately $260 million. The enhanced liquidity provided by CCE and Collectors Corner for certified coins, trading cards, and certified stamps, has increased the volume and turnover of these items, which benefits us because, as a general rule, increases in sales and purchases of those collectibles increase the demand for our authentication and grading services.
 
Publications and Advertising. We publish authoritative price guides, rarity reports and other collectibles data to provide collectors with information that makes them better informed consumers and makes collecting more interesting and exciting. Our publications also enable us to market our services, to create increased brand awareness and to generate advertising revenues. We publish the Sports Market Report on a monthly basis and the Rare Coins Market Report on a 2-month basis primarily for distribution to approximately 22,000 Collectors Club members. We sell advertising to dealers and vendors for placement in our publications. We manage a Collectors Universe website and individual websites for our authentication and grading services. On those websites, we offer collectible content, relevant to the marketplace for the specific authentication and grading service. We believe our websites for PCGS in coins, and PSA in trading cards, have the highest number of visitors and web traffic in their respective markets. We sell advertising to dealers and vendors on these two websites and on the websites we maintain for PSA/DNA in autographs and CCE and Collectors Corner in coins.
 
Collectible Trade Shows. We own Expos Unlimited LLC (“Expos”) a trade show management company that operates one of the larger coins and collectibles shows, staged in Long Beach, California, three times a year. At these shows collectibles are exhibited and are bought and sold by collectibles dealers and collectors.
Our Mission
 
Our mission is to provide the finest available independent authentication and grading services to sellers and buyers of high-value collectibles in order to:
 

■ | increase the values and liquidity of collectibles;
--+---------------------------------------------------


■ | enable and facilitate transactions in collectibles;
--+----------------------------------------------------


■ | generally enhance interest, activity and trading in collectibles; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | achieve profitable growth, build long-term value for our stockholders and provide rewarding opportunities for our employees.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
 
We have established leading brands in our existing collectibles markets, including PCGS, PSA and PSA/DNA. We use those brands to promote Collectors Universe as the premier independent provider of authentication and grading services in the collectibles markets, in order to (i) increase our market share among existing users of authentication and grading services, (ii) increase the use of our services by the numerous collectors that do not currently use any independent third-party authentication or grading services, and (iii) expand our coin and trading cards services to selected international markets.

Although we have authenticated and graded approximately 41 million coins since the inception of PCGS, and approximately 35 million trading cards since the inception of PSA, we believe that less than 10% of the vintage United States coins and less than 10% of the vintage trading cards have been authenticated and graded by independent providers of authentication and grading services. Additionally, we estimate that we have authenticated and graded less than 10% of the potential market of autographs in the United States. Moreover, new collectibles are introduced each year into the markets in which we operate, some of which are authenticated and graded in the year of their introduction. Over time, these collectibles will increase the supply of vintage items that are sold by dealers and collectors, and we expect that many of them will be submitted for independent authentication and grading.
 
To take advantage of these market opportunities to expand our service offerings to customers and to solidify our position as a leading authority in the collectible markets that we serve, we have:
 

■ | expanded our geographical reach by opening offices in France, Japan, Hong Kong and China, the operations of which, in total, accounted for approximately 10% of our net revenues in fiscal 2019;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | provided special packaging on certain modern coin programs that enhances the value of commemorative coins and helps drive increased volumes of coins sold by dealers and distributors of those coins;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | provided collectibles information and value-added content through our online encyclopedia- CoinFacts and PSA Collectible Facts, as well as through printed publications;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | participated at collectibles industry trade shows and organized “members only” shows for PCGS authorized dealers and Collectors Club members, at which we offer on-site authentication and grading services to facilitate collectibles trading activities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | established authorized PCGS and PSA dealer networks to increase the visibility of our brands and the use of our services by those dealers and their customers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | continued to enhance our Set RegistrySM programs to increase demand for our collectible coin and trading card authentication and grading services, among collectors and to increase traffic on our websites;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | promoted our Collectors Clubs to attract and to provide incentives for collectors to use our services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | expanded our website information services, to include auction results, reference materials and ongoing collectibles price guides and population reports.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operations
 
We offer authentication and grading services for coins, trading cards, autographs and autographed memorabilia. Our trained and experienced authentication and grading experts determine the authenticity of and using uniform quality standards, assign quality grades to these collectibles.
PCGS. Our authentication and grading of coins involves an exacting and standardized process. We receive coins from dealers and collectors and remove all packaging that identifies the submitter in any way. We then enter information regarding each coin into our proprietary computerized inventory system, which tracks the coin at every stage of the authentication and grading process. Generally, our process requires that at least two of our experts evaluate each coin independently. In some cases, depending on the type of coin being authenticated and graded or on the results of the initial review process, we involve a third expert to make the final determinations of authenticity and grade. The coin’s authenticity and grade are then verified by one of our senior experts, who has the authority to resubmit the coin for further review if he or she deems it to be necessary. Only after this process is complete is the coin reunited with its identifying paperwork, thus keeping the authentication and grading process from being influenced by the identity of the owner and the history of the coin. The coin is then sonically sealed in our specially designed, tamper-evident, clear plastic holder, which also encases a label describing the coin, the quality grade that we have assigned to it, a unique certificate number, the PCGS hologram and brand name and if requested by the customer, special inserts that can enhance the collectible value of the coin.
PSA. On receipt of trading cards from dealers and collectors, we remove all packaging that identifies the submitter in any way and enter information regarding the trading card into our proprietary computerized inventory system that enables us to track the trading cards throughout the authentication and grading process. Only after the authentication and grading process is complete is the trading card reunited with its identifying paperwork, thus keeping the authentication and grading process independent of the identity of the owner and the history of the trading card. The trading card is then sonically sealed in our specially designed, tamper-evident, clear plastic holder, which also encases a label that identifies the trading card, the quality grade that we have assigned to it and a unique certificate number, and the PSA hologram and brand name. We primarily authenticate and grade sportscards and, to a lesser extent, entertainment, as well as other types of collectible cards that are growing in popularity.
PSA/DNA. Because of the variability in the size of autographed memorabilia, the authentication and grading procedures we use necessarily differ from those used in authenticating and grading coins and trading cards. Customers may ship the autographed memorabilia to us for authentication at our offices or, in the case of dealers or collectors that desire to have a large number of items authenticated, we will sometimes send an expert to the customer’s location for “on-site” examination and authentication. Our experts reference what we believe is one of the largest databases of known genuine exemplars of signatures for comparison to a submitted item and draw upon their training and experience in handwriting analysis. In most cases, we take a digital photograph of the autographs that we have authenticated and store those photographs in a master database. Before shipping the item back to the customer, a tamper-evident label is affixed to the collectible at the customer’s option. The label contains our PSA/DNA name and logo and a unique certificate number. For additional security, in all cases when an item is fully authenticated, we tag the items with synthetic DNA-laced ink, which is odorless, colorless and tasteless and visible only when exposed to a narrow band wavelength of laser light using a hand-held, battery-powered lamp. Additional verification that an autographed item was authenticated by us can be obtained by using a chemical analysis to determine whether or not the ink used in the unique DNA code by PSA/DNA was applied to the autographed item. As a result, if the tamper-evident label that we affixed to an autographed item were to be removed or otherwise separated from the item, it is still possible to verify that the item was authenticated by us.

Marketing
 
We employ both “pull” and “push” strategies in marketing our services to dealers and collectors of high-value collectibles. For collectibles, our “pull” strategies are designed to promote our brands, increase the preference among collectors for our authentication and grading services and encourage collectors to communicate that preference to their collectibles dealers, because most authentication and grading submissions are made by dealers. In our experience, if a customer requests a particular grading service, the dealer ordinarily will comply with that request. On the other hand, if the customer expresses no preference, the dealer will make its own choice of authentication and grading service or may even decide not to submit the collectible to an independent service for authentication and grading. Therefore, our “pull” oriented marketing programs emphasize (i) the protections that collectors and retail customers will have if they purchase collectibles that we have authenticated and graded; and (ii) the improved marketability and higher prices that they and the associated retailers can realize if they use our independent third-party authentication and grading services. Our “push” strategy, on the other hand, is designed to market our services directly to collectibles dealers to encourage them to use and promote our services.
 
Our “Pull” Strategy. We have developed and implemented a number of marketing programs and initiatives designed to create consumer preference for collectibles that have been authenticated and graded by us. Those programs and initiatives include:

■ | Set Registry Programs. We provide collectors with the opportunity to participate in free Internet “Set Registry” programs that we host on our collectibles websites. These programs encourage collectors to assemble full sets of related collectibles that have been authenticated and graded by us. Generally, each registered set is comprised of between 50 and 200 separate, but related, collectibles. Examples include particular issues of coins, such as Twenty Dollar Gold Double Eagles or Morgan Silver Dollars; particular sets of trading cards, such as all Hall of Fame pitchers or a particular team, like the 1961 Yankees. Our Set Registry programs enable collectors:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


— | to register their sets on our websites, which provides them with an off-site reference source for insurance and informational purposes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


— | to display on our websites, and compare the completeness and quality grades of the collectibles making up their sets to those of other collectors who have registered similar sets on our websites, thereby creating a competitive aspect to collecting that adds to its excitement; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


— | to enter our annual Company-sponsored Set Registry competitions and awards programs in which collectors can win awards for having collected the most complete and highest graded sets of particular series or issues of coins or trading cards.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The collectibles that may be registered on our Set Registries and included in our Set Registry competitions are limited to collectibles that have been authenticated and graded by us. To register the collectibles to be included in a particular set, a collector is required to enter the unique certificate number that we had assigned to each of the collectibles when last authenticated and graded by us. We use the certificate number to compare the information being submitted by the collector with our database of information to verify that the collectibles being registered by a participant for inclusion in a particular set, qualify to be included in that set. We have found that our Set Registry competitions (i) create a preference and increase demand among collectors for our brands, and (ii) promote the trading of collectibles authenticated and graded by us by set registrants seeking to improve the completeness and overall quality of their sets, which generally results in additional authentication and grading submissions to us. Annual awards for set completeness and quality have been issued by PCGS and PSA each year since 2002. As an indication of the increasing popularity of our Set Registry programs, approximately 254,000 sets were registered on our Set Registries as of June 30, 2019, which represents a 12% increase over the number registered as of June 30, 2018.
 

■ | Collectors Club Subscription Program. We also have established “Collectors Clubs” for coin and trading card collectors. For an annual membership fee, ranging from $59 to $249, collectors receive a number of benefits, including (i) the right to have, without any further charge, a specified number of collectibles authenticated and graded by us, a privilege that non-member collectors do not have; and (ii) access to certain proprietary data that we make available on our websites or in print. At June 30, 2019, there were approximately 22,000 members in our Collectors Clubs.

■ | Certified Coin Exchange (“CCE”) Business-to-Business Website and Collectors Corner Business-to-Consumer Website. The CCE website is a business-to-business website where recognized dealers make markets in and can sell and purchase coins and other collectibles that have been certified by us or by other independent coin grading services. Currently, there are over 160,000 certified coins being offered at bid and ask prices. We believe that the liquidity created for certified coins by CCE increases the demand for PCGS certified coins among dealers. In addition, we provide a market on Collectors Corner , which is a business to consumer website where consumers can identify and purchase coins, trading cards and currency offered for sale by authorized dealers. We believe that Collectors Corner has advantages over other business-to-consumer websites because the counterparties to the consumers, who buy and sell collectibles via Collectors Corner, have been accepted as sellers on the Collectors Corner website and are known members in the collectibles markets and the collectibles selling communities. Collectibles are listed at fixed prices, with the opportunity to negotiate lower prices. We believe that the increased turnover offered for collectibles listed on Collectors Corner, as well as the ability to use Collectors Corner to improve a coin or trading card set in the PCGS and PSA Set Registries, respectively, creates increased brand preference for PCGS and PSA authenticated and graded collectibles.

Our “Push” Strategy. We also market our services directly to collectibles dealers and auctioneers to promote their use of our authentication and grading services. Our marketing message is focused on the enhanced marketability of collectibles that we have certified due to the increase in customer confidence that is attributable to our independent authentication and grading of those collectibles. These marketing programs include:

■ | Trade Shows and Conventions. There are numerous collectibles trade shows and conventions held annually in the United States and overseas, where collectibles dealers gather on a trading floor or bourse to buy and sell collectibles. We attend the largest and most significant of those trade shows and conventions, at many of which we offer same-day on-site authentication and grading services, which facilitate the trading and sales of collectibles at these shows and conventions. At the same time, we obtain additional brand exposure and generate increased revenues, because dealers and collectors generally are willing to pay higher fees for same- day on-site authentication and grading services at such trade shows and conventions.

■ | Expos. We own Expos Unlimited LLC (“Expos”), a trade show management company that operates one of the larger and better-known coin and collectibles shows staged, three times a year, in Long Beach, California. Those shows enable us to showcase our services and expertise better than at trade shows that we do not own or operate. In addition, Expos assures us of the continued availability of this show venue for our onsite authentication and grading services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


■ | Authorized Dealer Network. We have implemented authorized dealer programs for coin and trading card collectibles dealers and auction companies. Authorized dealers are able to use our marketing materials which are designed to promote our services and those of our authorized dealers to collectors. Those materials include “point of sale” and “point of purchase” displays and brochures and direct mail pieces for insertion in customer mailings. In addition, authorized dealers may use our brand logotypes on their websites to attract buyers for coins and trading cards that have been authenticated and graded by us. We also conduct joint marketing programs with our authorized dealers in which we provide financial support for dealer marketing programs, approved by us, that promote both the dealer’s products and services and our authentication and grading services.

Collectibles Experts
 
As of June 30, 2019, we employed 71 experts in our authentication and grading operations, with an average of 12 years of service with the Company. Our experts include individuals that either (i) had previously been collectibles dealers or were recognized as experts in the markets we serve, (ii) have been trained by us in our authentication and grading methodologies and procedures, or (iii) had gained authentication and grading experience at competing authentication and grading companies. However, talented collectibles authentication and grading experts are in short supply, and there is considerable competition among collectibles authentication and grading companies for their services. As a result, we focus on training young authenticators and graders (including non-US individuals) who we believe have the skills or knowledge base to become collectibles experts. We also contract with outside experts, usually collectibles dealers, to assist us with special grading issues or to enable us to address short-term increases in authentication and grading orders.
Service Warranties
 
We generally issue an authenticity or grading warranty with every coin and trading card authenticated or graded by us. Under the terms of the warranty, in general, if a coin or trading card that was authenticated or graded by us later receives a lower grade upon resubmission to us for grading, or is determined not to be authentic, based on our opinion, we will offer either to purchase the coin or trading card at the current market value at the originally assigned grade or, instead, at the customer’s option, to pay the difference in the current market value of the item between its original assigned grade and its lower grade. We accrue for estimated warranty costs based on historical claims experience, and we monitor the adequacy of the warranty reserves on an ongoing basis. If warranty claims were to increase in relation to historical trends and experience, we would increase the warranty reserve and incur additional charges that would have the effect of reducing income in those periods during which the warranty reserve is increased. See ITEM 7: “MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-Critical Accounting Policies: Grading Warranty Costs”, and ITEM 8: Consolidated Financial Statements -Note 6 of this report for more information regarding our warranty reserves. As discussed above, before returning an authenticated or graded coin or trading card to our customer, we place the coin or trading card in a tamper-evident, clear plastic holder that encapsulates a label identifying the collectible as having been authenticated and graded by us. The warranty is voided if the plastic holder has been broken or damaged or shows signs of tampering.
 
We do not provide a warranty with respect to our opinions regarding the authenticity or quality of autographs or memorabilia.

Customer Service and Support 
 
We devote significant resources to customer services, including a 40-person staff that provides personalized customer service and support in a timely manner, while also supporting our Set Registry, trade show programs and overseas offices. On our websites, customers are able to check the status of their collectibles submissions throughout the authentication and grading process and to confirm the authenticity of the collectibles that we have graded. When customers need services or have any questions, they can telephone or e-mail our support staff, Monday through Friday between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., Pacific Time. We also involve our collectibles experts in providing support services, when necessary, to address special issues.
Supplies
 
In order to obtain volume discounts, we have chosen to purchase the injection-molded critical high-volume plastic parts for our clear plastic holders from a limited number of suppliers. We typically concentrate the purchase of holders through one supplier when developing new holders, although, we now have back up suppliers and dies for our critical parts. If it became necessary for us to obtain parts from an additional supplier, we would have to arrange for the fabrication of a die for that new supplier, which can be a lengthy process. However, as we own the dies used to manufacture the parts they should be able to be moved to replacement suppliers. We believe the inventory of parts we maintain and the availability of back-up suppliers (including overseas suppliers) is sufficient to give us the time to change suppliers, if considered necessary.
Competition
 
Coin Authentication and Grading. Our principal competitors in the coin authentication and grading market are Numismatic Guaranty Corporation of America (“NGC”), Independent Coin Grading, Certified Acceptance Corporation (“CAC”) and ANACS, all of which are privately owned businesses.
Trading Card Authentication and Grading. Our primary competitors in trading card authentication and grading are Beckett Trading Card Grading Corporation, and Trading Card Guaranty, LLC.
 
Autograph Authentication and Grading. In the vintage autograph authentication market, we compete with James Spence Authentication (“JSA”) and a few smaller competitors.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our collectibles authentication and grading markets are (i) brand recognition and awareness; (ii) an established reputation for integrity, independence and consistency in our approach to establishing authenticity and in the application of grading standards; and (iii) responsiveness of service. We have found that price is much less of a factor in the case of vintage collectibles, but is a more important consideration with respect to modern coins and trading cards because of their significantly lower values. We believe that our PCGS, PSA and PSA/DNA brands compete favorably with respect to all of these factors and are among the leaders in each of their respective markets. Barriers to entry into the authentication and grading market are relatively low, especially in the trading card authentication and grading market. However, brand name recognition and a reputation for integrity, independence and consistency in the application of grading standards can take several years to develop. In addition, we believe that the sheer number of coins and cards that are in PCGS and PSA holders acts as a barrier to entry to new competitive start-up brands. The limited supply of experienced collectibles experts also operates as a barrier to entry.
Information Technology
 
IT Systems. We have developed a number of proprietary software systems for use in our authentication and grading operations, as well as for the operation and maintenance of our websites. Custom applications include grading systems, inventory control and order tracking systems, and other internally developed applications to manage the day-to-day operations of the Company. Websites have multiple customer-facing content/information systems, including (but not limited to) PSA CollectibleFacts, PCGS CoinFacts, multiple price guide and population reports, and multiple eCommerce solutions. Internally, these websites and applications are managed through a proprietary content management system. The majority of internally developed systems are written in Microsoft C# .NET and, in some limited cases, Microsoft Visual Basic .NET (all using a number of high-availability virtual machine systems or Microsoft SQL Server clusters on the back end).
 
The majority of the information technology systems (both for internal use and on publicly-accessible websites) are located at a Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (“SSAE”) 18 compliant data center in Southern California. This data center offers:
 

● | 24/7/365 monitoring and alerting of environmental conditions (including temperature, humidity, power status, etc.) through multiple/redundant hardware sensors and systems;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | 24/7/365 physical security through both technology (cameras, sensors, biometric access control, etc.) and always-present security staff; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | redundant Internet connectivity, power, and cooling systems that are tested on a regular basis.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also maintain a number of systems to monitor the availability and performance of our sites and systems, including:
 

● | 24/7/365 monitoring and alerting of website availability and performance through both internally developed and third-party solution providers; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 24/7/365 monitoring and alerting of Internet-based security threats through internal security systems, dedicated hardware devices, and external third-party solution providers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to the Southern California data center, smaller internal-use-only local area networks exist in our Southern California, New Jersey, Paris, Shanghai, and Hong Kong operations centers. However, the Information Technology infrastructure in those smaller offices is limited. Therefore, any damage to, or failure of, our computer systems due to a catastrophic event in Southern California, such as an earthquake, could cause an interruption in our services. We believe that these risks are mitigated by a comprehensive data backup/protection solution, which includes regular rotation of offsite data storage.
 
Cyber Security. Cyber security is one of our top priorities and is always contemplated when developing and deploying new systems (both software and hardware). To this end, key staff members maintain industry-standard security and audit certifications and regularly expand their security knowledge and deploy new security tools as considered necessary.
 
We maintain multiple Internet connections for both web serving and outbound Internet access. Internet access points (across all offices) are protected with Palo Alto enterprise-level firewalls and security products. Additional security features include limiting access to critical infrastructure components through next generation end point protection that includes dynamic machine learning capabilities and predictive models. In addition to the constant monitoring of these security devices, network security scans (of both internal and publicly-accessible servers) are performed on a regular basis. These scans include penetration/intrusion testing, vulnerability assessments, and attack surface analysis. We have multiple overlapping security infrastructures to mitigate potential single failures. However, as many other businesses have experienced, there can be no assurance that the security measures we have adopted will prove to be adequate to enable us to detect and prevent all cyber-security breaches that could lead to the theft by hackers of confidential information entrusted to us by our customers, including passwords and credit card numbers. See “Risk Factors-Our business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches” in ITEM 1A below in this Annual Report.
 
Government Regulation
 
With the exception of laws in some states that require memorabilia authenticators to certify to the accuracy of their authentication opinions, there are no material government regulations specifically relating to the authentication and grading businesses that we conduct, other than regulations that apply generally to businesses operating in the markets where we maintain operations or conduct business.
Employees
 
As of June 30, 2019, we had a total of 434 employees, of which 377 were full-time employees and 57 were part-time employees including 57 who were employed outside of the United States. Our authentication and grading-related businesses employed 371 people, including our 71 experts and 40 customer service and support personnel. Of the other 63 employees, 18 work in information services, 6 in marketing, 6 in our CCE subscription business, 6 in our Expos business (of which 5 were part-time employees), and 27 in other business and administrative services. We have never had a work stoppage, and no employees are represented under collective bargaining agreements. We consider relations with our employees to be good.
