ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a global medical technology company that develops, manufactures and markets a variety of noninvasive monitoring technologies and hospital automation™ solutions. Our mission is to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of patient care. Our patient monitoring solutions generally incorporate a monitor or circuit board, proprietary single-patient use or reusable sensors, software and/or cables. We provide our products to hospitals, emergency medical service (EMS) providers, home care providers, long-term care facilities, physician offices, veterinarians and consumers through our direct sales force, distributors and original equipment manufacturers (OEM) partners. We were incorporated in California in May 1989 and reincorporated in Delaware in May 1996.
Our core business is Measure-through Motion and Low Perfusion™ pulse oximetry, known as Masimo Signal Extraction Technology® (SET®) pulse oximetry. Our product offerings have expanded significantly over the years to also include noninvasive monitoring of blood constituents with an optical signature, optical regional oximetry monitoring, electrical brain function monitoring, acoustic respiration monitoring, exhaled gas monitoring, nasal high flow ventilation, minimally invasive neuromodulation technology for pain and addiction reduction, hospital automation™ and connectivity solutions and home wellness and monitoring. 
These technologies are incorporated into a variety of product platforms designed to meet our customers’ needs. In addition, we provide our technologies to OEMs in a form factor that is easy to integrate into their patient monitors, defibrillators, infant incubators and other devices. 
Our technology is supported by a substantial intellectual property portfolio that we have built through internal development and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions and license agreements. We have also exclusively licensed from Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (Cercacor) the right to certain OEM rainbow® technologies and to incorporate certain rainbow® technology into our products intended to be used by professional caregivers, including, but not limited to, hospital caregivers and alternate care facility caregivers.
Core Business
Conventional Pulse Oximetry 
Pulse oximetry enables the noninvasive measurement of the oxygen saturation level of arterial blood (SpO), which delivers oxygen to the body’s tissues. Pulse oximetry also measures pulse rate (PR), which, when measured by electrocardiogram (ECG), is called heart rate. Pulse oximeters use sensors attached to an extremity, typically the fingertip or certain core body sites. These sensors contain two light-emitting diodes that transmit red and infrared light from one side of the extremity through the tissue to a photodetector on the other side of the extremity. The photodetector in the sensor measures the amount of red and infrared light absorbed by the tissue. A microprocessor then analyzes the changes in light absorption to provide a continuous, real-time measurement of the amount of oxygen in the patient’s arterial blood. Pulse oximeters typically give audio and visual alerts, or alarms, when the patient’s arterial blood oxygen saturation level or pulse rate falls outside of a user-designated range. As a result, clinicians have the opportunity to assess patients who may need immediate treatment to prevent the serious clinical consequences of hypoxemia, or low arterial blood oxygen saturation levels, and hyperoxemia, or high arterial blood oxygen levels.
As one of the most common technologies used in and out of hospitals around the world, pulse oximetry has gained widespread clinical acceptance as a standard patient vital sign measurement because it can give clinicians a warning of possible hypoxemia or hyperoxemia. SpO2 monitoring of oxygen saturation is critical because hypoxemia can lead to a lack of oxygen in the body’s tissues, which can be toxic and result in organ damage or death. Pulse oximeters are used in a variety of critical care settings, including surgery, recovery rooms, intensive care units (ICUs), emergency departments and general care floors, as well as alternative care settings, such as long-term care facilities, physician offices and the home monitoring of patients with chronic conditions.
Clinicians also use pulse oximeters to monitor oxygen saturation in premature babies to ensure that appropriate oxygen saturation levels are maintained. In premature babies, oxygen saturation levels above clinically acceptable limits may lead to a condition known as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), which, if left untreated, can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness. By ensuring that oxygen saturation levels in babies remain within clinically acceptable limits, clinicians believe they can lower the incidence of ROP.
Conventional pulse oximetry has limitations that can reduce its effectiveness and the quality of patient care. In particular, when using conventional pulse oximetry, oxygen saturation measurements can be distorted by motion artifact, or patient movement, and low perfusion, or low arterial blood flow at the measurement site. Motion artifact can cause conventional pulse oximeters to inaccurately measure the arterial blood oxygen saturation level, due mainly to the effect of movement-induced pulsations of venous blood, which is at a lower oxygen saturation than arterial blood. Low perfusion can also cause conventional pulse oximeters to report inaccurate measurements or, in some cases, no measurement at all. In addition, conventional pulse oximeters cannot distinguish oxygenated hemoglobin from dyshemoglobin, including the most prevalent forms of dyshemoglobins, carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin. As a result, conventional pulse oximeters may report falsely high oxygen levels when these dyshemoglobins are present in the blood. Furthermore, conventional pulse oximetry readings can also be impacted by bright light and electrical interference caused by the presence of electrical surgical equipment. 
Independent research has shown that over 70% of oxygen saturation alarms outside the operating room are false when conventional pulse oximetry is used. In the operating room, conventional pulse oximeters can fail to give accurate measurements due to weak physiological signals or low perfusion. Manufacturers of pulse oximeters have attempted to address some of these limitations with varying degrees of success. Some competing devices have attempted to minimize the observed effects of motion artifact by repeating/freezing the last measurement before motion artifact was detected until a new, clean signal is detected and a new measurement can be displayed. Other competing devices increase the averaging time during motion, known as long averaging, in an attempt to reduce the observed effect of motion on their measurements. Still other competing devices extend the audible alarm notification delay, which reduces awareness of inaccurate measurements. These competing “motion tolerant” or “alarm management” techniques mask the limitations of conventional pulse oximetry. Several published studies have demonstrated that these also contribute to increased occurrences of undetected true alarms, or events where hypoxemia occurs but is not detected by the pulse oximeter.
Lastly, because conventional pulse oximetry cannot consistently measure SpO2 and pulse rate in the presence of motion artifact or low perfusion, its use is limited in lower acuity settings in the hospital, such as in general care areas, where a hospital’s staff-to-patient ratio is significantly lower and the staff have less tolerance for false alarms. In addition, two-wavelength pulse oximeters cannot distinguish oxygenated hemoglobin from dyshemoglobin, including the most prevalent forms of carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin. As a result of these dyshemoglobins, pulse oximeters will report falsely high oxygen levels when they are present in the blood.

Masimo Difference
Masimo SET® Pulse Oximetry 
Masimo SET® was designed to overcome the primary limitations of conventional pulse oximetry by maintaining accuracy in the presence of motion artifact, low perfusion and weak signal-to-noise situations. Our Masimo SET® platform, which became available to U.S. hospitals in 1998, is the basis of our pulse oximetry products, and we believe represented the first significant technological advancement in pulse oximetry since its introduction in the early 1980s. Masimo SET® utilizes five signal processing algorithms, four of which are proprietary, in parallel to deliver high sensitivity and specificity in the measurement of arterial blood oxygen saturation levels. Sensitivity is the ability to detect true alarms and specificity is the ability to avoid false alarms. One of our proprietary processing algorithms, Discrete Saturation Transform®, separates the signal from noise in real time through the use of adaptive filtering and an iterative sampling technique that tests each possible saturation value for validity. Masimo SET® signal processing can therefore identify the venous blood and other “noise”, isolate them and extract the arterial signal.
The performance of Masimo SET® pulse oximetry has been evaluated in more than 100 independent studies and thousands of clinical evaluations. We believe that Masimo SET® is trusted by clinicians to safely monitor in excess of approximately 200 million patients each year and has been chosen as the primary pulse oximeter technology used by nine of the top ten hospitals according to the 2021-2022 U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals Honor Roll. Compared to conventional pulse oximeters, during patient motion and low perfusion, Masimo SET® provides measurements when other pulse oximeters cannot, significantly reduces false alarms (improved specificity), and accurately detects true alarms (improved sensitivity). Clinical studies have shown that the use of Masimo SET® pulse oximetry, in conjunction with modified clinical protocols, has helped clinicians reduce ROP in neonates and improve screening for newborns with critical congenital heart disease (CCHD). Clinical studies have also shown a reduction in rapid response activations and ICU transfers when Masimo SET® is used to continuously monitor patients on general wards. Additionally, researchers have found that the use of Masimo SET® is associated with reduced ventilator weaning time and arterial blood gas measurements in the ICU.
Our pulse oximetry technology is contained on a circuit board which can be placed inside a standalone pulse oximetry monitor, placed inside OEM multiparameter monitors, or included as part of an external “Board-in-Cable” solution that is plugged into a port on an OEM or other device. All of these solutions use our proprietary single-patient-use or reusable sensors and cables. We sell our products to end-users through our direct sales force and through certain distributors, as well as to our OEM partners, for incorporation into their products. In 2013, we also began selling our pulse oximetry products in the consumer market. 
To complement our Masimo SET® platform, we have developed a wide range of proprietary single-patient-use (disposable) and multi-patient-use (reusable) sensors, cables and other accessories designed specifically to work with Masimo SET® software and hardware. Our single-patient-use sensors offer several advantages over reusable sensors, including improved performance, cleanliness, increased comfort and greater reliability. In addition, our neonatal adhesive sensors have been designed to exhibit greater durability compared to competitive sensors. Although our technology platforms operate solely with our proprietary sensor lines, our sensors have the capability to work with certain competitive pulse oximetry monitors through the use of adapter cables.
Adhesive sensors are single-patient-use items, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows third parties to reprocess pulse oximetry sensors. In response to some hospitals’ requests to implement environmentally friendly or “green” products, we offer sensor reprocessing as well as sensor recycling programs. 
Masimo rainbow SET® Platform 
Since introducing Masimo SET®, we have continued to innovate by introducing noninvasive measurements that go beyond arterial blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate. Our Masimo rainbow SET® platform leverages our Masimo SET® technology and incorporates licensed rainbow® technology to enable real-time monitoring of additional noninvasive measurements. Our rainbow SET® platform includes our rainbow SET® Pulse CO-Oximetry products, which we believe are the first devices cleared by the FDA to noninvasively and continuously monitor additional hemoglobin species that were previously only measurable using intermittent invasive procedures using multiple wavelengths of light.
In addition to SpO2, PR, perfusion index (Pi), Pleth Variability Index (PVi®) and respiration rate from the pleth (RRp®), rainbow® Pulse CO-Oximetry has the unique ability to measure and distinguish oxygenated hemoglobins from the dyshemoglobins that are incapable of transporting oxygen, carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO®) and methemoglobin (SpMet®). Besides the ability to measure SpCO® and SpMet®, the Masimo rainbow SET® platform also allows for the noninvasive and continuous monitoring of total hemoglobin concentration (SpHb®) as well as the monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation, in the presence of carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin, known as fractional arterial oxygen saturation (SpfO2™). Additionally, the rainbow SET® platform also allows for the calculation of Oxygen Content (SpOC™) and Oxygen Reserve Index™ (ORi™). SpfO™ and ORi™ have received CE Marking, but are not currently available for sale in the U.S.
We believe that Masimo rainbow® Pulse CO-Oximetry products will become widely adopted for the noninvasive monitoring of these measurements in the future. We also believe that the addition of acoustic respiration rate (RRa®), using our rainbow Acoustic Monitoring® technology, will strengthen the clinical demand for noninvasive and continuous monitoring using our rainbow® platform, especially in the growing general floor market.
Products with our MX circuit board contain our Masimo SET® pulse oximetry technology as well as circuitry to support rainbow® measurements. At the time of purchase, or at any time in the future, our customers and our OEMs’ customers have the option of purchasing additional rainbow® software measurements, which allow such customers to incrementally expand their patient monitoring systems with a cost-effective solution. To date, over forty companies have released rainbow SET® equipped products or announced rainbow® integration plans.
Measurements
SpHb®
Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells (RBCs). Hemoglobin measurement is one of the most frequent invasive laboratory measurements in the world, and is often measured as part of a complete blood count (CBC), which measures multiple other blood components. A low hemoglobin status is a condition called anemia. As a chronic disorder, anemia can be treated by iron supplements, diet changes or drugs that increase the production of RBCs. As an acute disorder resulting from bleeding, anemia requires either stoppage of the bleeding or a blood transfusion in order to sustain organ function and life. 
SpHb® is available as a continuous or a spot-check measurement. Continuous SpHb® monitoring provides real-time visibility into hemoglobin levels and the changes, or lack of changes, in hemoglobin levels, which can otherwise only be measured through intermittent, invasive blood testing. SpHb® monitoring is not intended to be used as the sole basis for making diagnosis or treatment decisions, but continuous SpHb® monitoring may help clinicians to trend hemoglobin in real time between invasive blood samples.
SpOC™
The oxygen content of blood is a function of both oxygen saturation and hemoglobin levels. SpOC™ provides a more complete picture of a patient’s oxygenation status by combining noninvasive and continuous measurements of both hemoglobin and oxygen saturation levels into a single calculation.
SpCO®
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless and tasteless gas that is undetectable by humans and is often unknowingly inhaled from combustion fumes, or during fires by victims and first responders. CO poisoning is the leading cause of accidental poisoning death in the U.S. and is responsible for up to 50,000 emergency department visits and 500 unintentional deaths annually. CO, when bound to hemoglobin cells, prevents those cells from carrying oxygen. Elevated CO levels may cause severe neurological damage, permanent heart damage or death. Screening for elevated CO levels in the emergency department is critical, as symptoms of CO poisoning in patients may be misdiagnosed because such symptoms are similar to the flu. 
CO levels in the blood can be measured using a laboratory CO-Oximeter, which requires a patient or a patient’s blood sample to be transported to a hospital with laboratory CO-Oximetry capability. Additional delays occur if a patient needs hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which often requires transfer to yet another medical center with hyperbaric capability. Outside the hospital, laboratory measurements of carboxyhemoglobin are not considered feasible. Historically, this meant that CO levels in the blood could not be assessed in environments in which such assessment would be very useful, such as in the home or as part of the medical evaluation of first responders potentially exposed to CO at the scene of a fire. 
While SpCO® is not intended to replace invasive carboxyhemoglobin tests, when used with other clinical variables, SpCO® may help clinicians identify elevated CO levels and help determine additional test and treatment options. Multiple leading emergency first responder associations, including the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians, the National Association of EMS Educators, the International Association of Fire Fighters and the International Association of Fire Chiefs, have educated their members on the benefits of noninvasive CO measurement when exposure is suspected or when an individual presents symptoms that could indicate elevated CO levels. 
SpMet®
Methemoglobin in the blood leads to a dangerous condition known as methemoglobinemia, which occurs as a reaction to some common drugs used in hospitals and outpatient procedures. Methemoglobinemia reduces the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin for delivery to tissues and forces normal hemoglobin to bind more tightly to oxygen, releasing less oxygen to the tissues. Methemoglobinemia may go unrecognized or be subject to delayed diagnosis, increasing risk to the patient. Commonly prescribed drugs can introduce methemoglobin into the blood and cause methemoglobinemia. Some of the 30 drugs that are known to cause methemoglobinemia include benzocaine, a local anesthetic routinely used in procedures ranging from endoscopy to surgery; inhaled nitric oxide, routinely used in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; nitroglycerin, used to treat cardiac patients; and dapsone, used to treat infections for immune-deficient patients such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) patients. Warnings, cautions and alerts regarding the clinical significance and prevalence of methemoglobinemia have been generated by the FDA, the Veterans Administration, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices and the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends monitoring methemoglobin levels in infants who receive nitric oxide therapy. While SpMet® is not intended to replace invasive methemoglobin tests, when used with other clinical variables, SpMet® may help clinicians identify elevated methemoglobin levels and help determine additional test and treatment options.
PVi® 
PVi® is a measure of the dynamic changes in the Perfusion Index (Pi) that occur during the respiratory cycle. The calculation is accomplished by measuring changes in Pi over a time interval where one or more complete respiratory cycles have occurred. PVi® is displayed as a percentage. The lower the number, the less variability there is in Pi over a respiratory cycle. PVi® may show changes that reflect physiologic factors such as vascular tone, circulating blood volume and intrathoracic pressure excursions. When used with other clinical variables, PVi® may help clinicians assess fluid responsiveness in surgical and intensive care patients who are mechanically ventilated and help determine other treatment options. PVi® has received FDA 510(k) clearance as a continuous, noninvasive, dynamic indicator of fluid responsiveness in select populations of mechanically ventilated adult patients.
RPVi™
Rainbow® Pleth Variability Index (RPVi™) is a multi-wavelength version of PVi® that is designed to provide enhanced specificity to changes in fluid volume compared to PVi®. Similar to PVi®, RPVi™ is displayed as a percentage and is calculated by measuring changes in Pi over a time interval where one or more complete respiratory cycles have occurred. The lower the number, the less variability there is in Pi over a respiratory cycle, which indicates more fluid in the body. RPVi™ has received the CE Mark, but is not currently available for sale in the U.S.
RRp®
Respiration rate is defined as the number of breaths per minute. Changes in respiration rate provide an early warning sign of deterioration in patient condition. A low respiration rate is indicative of respiratory depression and high respiration rate is indicative of patient distress. Current methods of monitoring respiration rate include end tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) monitoring, which requires a nasal cannula be inserted in the patient’s nose or a mask to be worn, and therefore has low patient compliance; and impedance monitoring, which is considered unreliable and requires the placement of ECG electrodes on the chest. RRp® allows clinicians to noninvasively and continuously measure and monitor respiration rate using a standard Masimo SET® pulse oximetry sensor or rainbow® Pulse CO-Oximetry sensor. RRp® is determined by the variations in the plethysmograph waveform due to respiration, although the measurement is not possible in all patients or conditions and may not immediately indicate changes in respiration rate. RRp® has received the CE Mark, as well as FDA 510(k) clearance when used in healthcare settings with the MightySat® Rx fingertip SET® pulse oximeter. RRp® is also available in the U.S. for use by consumers for general health and wellness purposes as part of our MightySat® fingertip pulse oximeter. RRp® has received FDA 510(k) clearance for continuous RRp® monitoring of adult and pediatric patients with Rad-97®, Radical-7® and Radius-7® Pulse Co-Oximeters®. With this clearance, both continuous and spot-check RRp® are now available in the U.S. and supported in a variety of pulse oximetry sensors and configurations, including a non-cabled, tetherless, wearable Radius PPG™.
5


RRa®
Our sound-based monitoring technology, rainbow Acoustic Monitoring® (RAM®), enables RRa® and provides continuous and noninvasive monitoring of respiration rate. For patients requiring accurate and sensitive respiration rate monitoring, we believe that RRa® better detects pauses in breathing than respiration rate measurements from other technologies such as EtCO2 monitoring and RRp®. RRa® also provides an important visual indication of breathing through a displayed acoustic waveform.
Multiple clinical studies have shown that the noninvasive measurement of acoustic respiration rate provides as good or better respiration rate monitoring accuracy as EtCO2 monitoring, and can reliably detect episodes of respiratory pause, defined as the cessation of breathing for 30 seconds or more. When used with other clinical variables, RRa® may help clinicians assess respiratory depression and respiratory distress earlier and more often to help determine treatment options and potentially enable earlier interventions.
SpfO2™
Prior to our debut of SpfO2™, pulse oximeters could only measure and display functional SpO2 oxygen saturation. Therefore, when patients had elevated carboxyhemoglobin and/or elevated methemoglobin, the displayed functional SpO2 oxygen saturation overestimated the actual oxygen saturation value. SpfO2™, or fractional oxygen saturation, allows more precise arterial oxygenation assessment in patients with elevated dyshemoglobins, common throughout the hospital and pre-hospital setting, compared to functional oxygen saturation, and may also allow earlier interventions and more timely therapeutic decisions. SpfO2™ has received the CE Mark, but is not currently available for sale in the U.S.
ORi™
ORi™ provides real-time visibility to oxygenation status in moderate hyperoxic range, which we define as a patient’s oxygen “reserve”. ORi™ can be trended and has optional alarms to notify clinicians of changes in a patient’s oxygen reserve. When this technology is used with SpO2 monitoring, ORi™ may extend the continuous and noninvasive visibility of a patient’s oxygen status into ranges previously unmonitored in this fashion. ORi™ may also be of value in patients receiving supplemental oxygen, such as those in surgery, under conscious sedation or in the ICU, as ORi™ is represented as an “index” parameter with a unit-less scale between 0.00 and 1.00. Furthermore, ORi™ may provide an advance warning of an impending hypoxic state, or an indication of an unintended hyperoxic state, when evaluated in conjunction with the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). In this way, ORi™ may assist in determining the need for proactive interventions to avoid hypoxia or unintended hyperoxia. ORi™ has received the CE Mark, but is not currently available for sale in the U.S.
Other Noninvasive Measurements
Following the introduction of our rainbow SET® platform, we have continued to expand our technology offerings by introducing additional noninvasive measurements and technologies to create new market opportunities in both hospital and non-hospital care settings.
SedLine® Brain Function Monitoring
Brain function monitoring is most commonly used during surgery to help clinicians avoid over-titration and under-titration of anesthesia and sedation. SedLine® brain function monitoring technology measures the brain’s electrical activity by detecting EEG signals. In contrast to whole-scalp EEG monitoring, which is used for diagnostic purposes, this form of EEG monitoring is often referred to as processed EEG monitoring or brain function monitoring. Brain function monitors display the patient’s EEG waveforms, but these may be difficult for clinicians to interpret. With SedLine® technology, EEG signals are processed and displayed as a single number called the Patient State Index (PSi), which gives a continuous quantitative indication of the patient’s depth of anesthesia and sedation. SedLine® brain function monitoring technology also displays raw EEG waveforms, the PSi trend and a Density Spectral Array view, which allows clinicians to compare EEG power in both sides of the brain over time to facilitate the detection of asymmetrical activity and agent-specific effects on the EEG signal. 
SedLine® brain function monitoring technology is available on Root® through the use of a Masimo Open Connect® (MOC-9®) connectivity port. The Root® patient monitoring and connectivity platform integrates rainbow® and SET® measurements with measurement technologies, such as SedLine®.
NomoLine® Capnography and Gas Monitoring
We offer a portfolio of capnography and gas monitoring products ranging from external “plug-in-and-measure” capnography and gas analyzers, integrated modules, handheld capnograph and capnometer devices and capnography sampling lines. Our NomoLine® capnography sampling lines are available in more than 40 configurations of airway adapter sets and cannulas for use in a variety of clinical scenarios on both intubated and non-intubated adult, pediatric, infant and neonatal patients, in both low and high humidity configurations, facilitating easy to use sidestream capnography and gas monitoring. 
6


These products have the ability to measure multiple expired gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), oxygen (O2) and other anesthetic agents. In addition, respiration rate is calculated from the CO2 waveform. These measurements are possible through either mainstream monitoring, which samples gases from a ventilated patient’s breathing circuit, or sidestream monitoring, which samples gases from a breathing circuit in mechanically ventilated patients or through a cannula or mask in spontaneously breathing patients. These capnography and gas measurements are standard-of-care in many hospital environments, such as operating rooms and ICUs, during procedural sedation. NomoLine® capnography sampling lines have received FDA 510(k) clearance.
O3® Organ Oximetry
O3® organ or Regional Oximetry, also known as tissue or cerebral oximetry, uses near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to provide continuous measurement of tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2) to help detect regional hypoxemia, or oxygen deficits in specific tissues such as the brain, that pulse oximetry alone cannot detect under certain conditions. In addition, O3® sensors, in conjunction with our Root® monitor, can automate the differential analysis of regional to central oxygen saturation derived from SET® pulse oximeters. O3® monitoring involves applying O3® Regional Oximetry sensors to the forehead and connecting the O3® MOC-9® module to a Root® monitor through one of its three MOC-9® ports. O3® Regional Oximetry has received the CE Mark and FDA 510(k) clearance for use in adult and pediatric patients, including use of O3® in infant and neonatal patients, as well as expanded use in monitoring somatic tissue oxygenation saturation in all patient populations and monitoring relative changes in hemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin in adult brains. 
Advanced Hemodynamic Monitoring Solutions
In January 2021, we acquired LiDCO Group, PLC, which specializes in advanced hemodynamic monitoring solutions. With the completion of this acquisition, we will be able to provide clinicians with access to patients’ cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), oxygen delivery (DO2), stroke volume variation (SVV) and pulse pressure variation (PPV), which are used to assess preload and afterload, to help determine the current state of a patient’s hemodynamic stability and whether any interventions are needed to optimize the delivery of oxygen to the tissues. Hemodynamic monitoring solutions are also used to monitor the response to therapies such as vasopressors, inotropes and fluids.
The Masimo Hospital AutomationTM Platform
Patient SafetyNet™(1)
Patient SafetyNet™, our patient surveillance, remote monitoring and clinician notification solution, works in concert with our bedside and ambulatory monitoring devices to facilitate the supplemental monitoring of the oxygen saturation, pulse rate, perfusion index, hemoglobin, methemoglobin and respiration rate of up to 200 patients simultaneously from a single server. Patient SafetyNet™ offers an intuitive and powerful user interface with trending, real-time waveform capability at a central station, as well as remote clinician notification via pager, voice-over-IP phone or smart-phones. Patient SafetyNet™ also features an Adaptive Connectivity Engine™ (ACE™) that enables two-way, HL-7 based connectivity to clinical/hospital information systems. The ACE™ significantly reduces the time and complexity to integrate and validate custom HL-7 implementations, and demonstrates our commitment to innovation that automates patient care with open, scalable and standards-based connectivity architecture.
Patient SafetyNet™ Series 5000, along with Hospital Automation™ Connectivity, Iris® Gateway, Kite®, UniView™, UniView : 60™, and MyView® through the Root® patient monitoring and connectivity platform, offers a new level of interoperability designed to enhance clinician workflows and reduce the cost of care in a variety of hospital settings, including operating rooms and the general care floors. Patient SafetyNet™ Series 5000 with Iris® ports enables Root® to assimilate data from all devices connected to the patient, thereby acting as a comprehensive in-room patient monitor and connectivity hub. Alarms and alerts for all devices are seamlessly forwarded to the patient’s clinician and device data can be transferred to the patient’s electronic medical record (EMR). The patient-centric user interface of the Patient SafetyNet™ Series 5000 displays near real-time data from all devices with Kite®, providing a single unified dashboard of patient information. To simplify documentation of patient data, Root® enables clinicians to easily verify and send patient vitals and Early Warning Scores (EWS), as well as all connected medical device information data, to the EMR directly from Root®.
An interface between the Patient SafetyNet™ Series 5000 and the hospital admission, discharge and transfer (ADT) system allows clinicians to receive ADT information on Root® for positive patient identification at the bedside. Clinicians can also manually enter additional data on the Root® device, including temperature, blood pressure, level of consciousness, pain score and urine output.
______________
(1) The use of the trademark Patient SafetyNet™ is under license from the University HealthSystem Consortium.
In a series of studies published between 2010 and 2020 by Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, clinicians using Masimo SET® and Patient SafetyNet™ identified patient distress earlier, which decreased rapid response team activations, ICU transfers and ICU days. Per these studies, over ten years, there were zero preventable deaths or brain damage due to opioid-induced respiratory depression in monitored patients. In addition, we believe these studies demonstrated that the use of Masimo SET® and Patient SafetyNet™ can result in significant cost savings. Hospitals and other care centers may determine that they can reduce their costs by moving less critically ill patients from the ICU to the general care floors where they can be continuously and accurately monitored in a more cost-effective manner. We believe that the advanced performance of the Masimo SET® platform coupled with reliable, cost-effective and easy-to-use wireless remote monitoring will allow hospitals to create continuous surveillance solutions on general care floors where patients are at risk of avoidable adverse events and where direct patient observation by skilled clinicians is considered cost prohibitive.
Kite®
Kite® provides a supplemental display of data from a Masimo device on a compatible smart television and allows clinicians to configure the display differently than that of the connected Masimo device. Kite® integrates into existing hospital infrastructures where a supplementary display may be beneficial, such as the operating room.
UniView™
UniView™, an integrated display of real-time data and alarms from multiple Masimo and third-party devices, designed to reduce clinician cognitive overload and improve patient safety. UniView™ promotes data sharing and team coordination among multiple clinicians. UniView™ brings together data from a variety of sources – such as patient monitors, ventilators, anesthesia gas machines, and IV pumps – and provides a supplementary display for them, clearly organized, on one or more large, central monitors, so that all clinicians can simultaneously view and act upon the same, comprehensive real-time patient status and historical trends.
UniView : 60™
UniView : 60™ uses the Masimo Hospital Automation™ platform to aggregate and display pertinent patient information on a digital display just outside each patient’s room, allowing clinicians to familiarize themselves with the most relevant details of each patient’s case at the door in 60 seconds or less before they see the patient.
Replica™
Replica™, working in conjunction with Patient SafetyNet™, is a mobile application for smart phones and tablets that provides for supplemental remote monitoring and clinician notification. Replica™ was developed to allow clinicians to view continuous monitoring data for multiple patients, as well as view and respond to alarms and alerts, all from their smart phones, regardless of location.
MyView®
MyView® is a wireless, presence-detection system that enables the display of customized clinical profiles on Masimo devices, such as Root®, Radical-7® and the Patient SafetyNet™ View Station. When a clinician approaches the device, a clinician-worn MyView® badge signals the device to display a preselected set of parameters and waveforms tailored to the individual clinician’s preferences. MyView® gives clinicians the ability to receive and review medical device information in a manner that is most conducive to optimizing their workflow, while the presence mapping data collected by all the Masimo devices can provide insight into how clinicians spend time with patients. This provides nursing leadership and management the opportunity to examine analytical data on patient-clinician interactions and optimize workflows across the unit, hospital and hospital system.
Patient SafetyNet™ Surveillance
Patient SafetyNet™ Surveillance is a software option that provides real-time video images of a patient’s room, including the patient and connected monitoring devices, adding existing communication technology to central monitoring. Two-way audio is available to allow the caregiver to listen to and communicate with the patient. The system utilizes the existing hospital information technology network, precluding the installation of additional infrastructure.
Connectivity
Despite medical technology advances, the lack of device communication and integration creates risks to patient safety in hospitals around the world. Without device interoperability, critical patient information can go unnoticed, leaving clinicians unaware and patients at risk. Existing approaches for device interoperability require separate hardware, software and/or network infrastructure, which can clutter the patient room, increase complexity, burden IT management and increase costs. To address these challenges, we introduced Iris® connectivity in our Root® patient monitoring and connectivity platform. Iris® connectivity enables multiple standalone third-party devices such as intravenous pumps (IV), ventilators, hospital beds and other patient monitors to connect through Root®, enabling display, notification and documentation to the EMR through Masimo Patient SafetyNet™. 
The addition of Iris® connectivity to Root® and Patient SafetyNet™ provides multiple advantages to hospitals, such as allowing standalone device information to be remotely viewed at a Patient SafetyNet™ view station, transmitted through notification systems to clinicians regardless of location or sent to electronic health record systems. This may enhance patient assessment, clinical workflows and decision support. In addition, bringing data from disparate devices together facilitates more integrated patient care and provides a flexible and cost-effective platform, while avoiding installation of separate costly systems and potentially reducing costs by leveraging existing network infrastructure.
Nasal High-Flow Ventilation
The Masimo softFlow™ technology provides respiratory support by generating a precisely regulated, stable and high flow of room air or a mix of room air and oxygen through the nose of the patient by means of thin nasal prongs. Controlled oxygen supply ensures oxygenation while, at the same time, the respiratory airways are humidified. A stable air flow is essential for treating hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. Together with the softflow™ nasal applicator, the softflow™ generator provides a constant air flow and in doing so, it is completely independent of external pneumatic systems. Due to this, the Masimo softFlow™ technology is able to treat respiratory insufficiency and allows therapy at home in a manner that is as reliable and efficient as in the hospital. 
Neuromodulation Solution
Bridge™ is the first FDA-cleared, drug-free, non-surgical device to use neuromodulation to aid in the reduction of symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal. Bridge™ can be used for patients experiencing opioid withdrawal symptoms, while undergoing treatment for opioid use disorder when initiating treatment, transitioning to naltrexone or tapering off medication-assisted treatment. In addition, we believe Bridge™ may reduce pain and addiction-related side-effects. Bridge™ is a small electrical nerve stimulator device that contains a battery-powered chip and wires that are applied percutaneously around a patient’s ear. It requires a prescription and is offered to qualified healthcare professionals with training. Bridge™ has been granted a FDA 510(k) de novo classification.

Recent Developments 
On February 15, 2022, we announced our entry into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Viper Holdings Corporation, which owns Sound United (“Sound United”), a consumer technology company that owns a portfolio of premium brands, including Bowers & Wilkins, Denon, Polk Audio and Marantz. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we will pay approximately $1.025 billion, subject to adjustments, for the acquisition. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the middle of 2022.
Our Strategy
Our mission is to develop technologies that improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of patient care. We intend to continue to grow our impact on patient care by not only providing patient-centered solutions to healthcare providers, but by also expanding outside of the hospital arena with our technologies that are improving lives in the hospitals. We believe that people and infrastructures are ready for actionable patient care outside of the hospital. Some of our tactics are explained below:
•Continue to Expand our Market Share in Pulse Oximetry. We grew our product revenue to $1,239.2 million in 2021 from $829.9 million in 2018, representing a three-year compound annual growth rate of 14.3%. This growth can be attributed to continued expansion of our core SET® pulse oximeter customer base, higher revenues from rainbow® Pulse CO-Oximetry, NomoLine® capnography and other new technologies, and our expanding list of OEM partners. We supplement our direct sales to hospitals and other low-acuity healthcare facilities through various U.S. and international distributors. Combined sales through our direct and distributor sales channels increased to $1,099.1 million, or 88.7% of product revenue in 2021, from $718.6 million, or 86.6% of product revenue, in 2018. As the healthcare industry shifts toward hospitals, physicians and providers being rewarded by payers based on the quality and value of the services (as opposed to the volume of fee-for-service transactions), we expect to see more hospitals gravitate towards technologies like Masimo SET® that have a proven track record of improving patient care.
•Expand the Pulse Oximetry Market to Other Patient Care Settings. Many patients die due to unintended opioid overdoses after surgery while on general care floors. We believe the ability to continuously and accurately monitor patients outside of critical care settings, including the general, medical and surgical floors of the hospital, is currently an unmet medical need that has the potential to significantly improve patient care and increase the size of the pulse oximetry market. In addition, we believe the ability of Masimo SET® to accurately monitor and address the limitations of conventional pulse oximetry has enabled us, and will continue to enable us, to expand into non-critical care settings, and therefore, significantly expand the market for our products. To further support our expansion into the general care areas, we market Patient SafetyNet™, which enables continuous monitoring of up to 200 patients’ SpO2, PR, RRp® and with rainbow SET®, noninvasive monitoring of hemoglobin and other advanced measurements. We believe that Patient SafetyNet™, when combined with Masimo SET® pulse oximetry and RAM® or capnography, offers a clinically proven and cost-effective approach to continuous post-operative monitoring. Outside of the hospital setting, patients could die due to unintentional opioid overdose, even when opioids are being taken for short duration, such as after surgery, and as prescribed by a physician. 
•Expand the Use of rainbow® Technology in Hospital Settings. We believe the noninvasive measurements of rainbow® Pulse CO-Oximetry (SpHb®, SpCO®, SpMet®, PVi®, SpfO2™, SpOC™ and ORi™), RAM® and Halo Ion®, as well as future measurements, provide an excellent opportunity to help our customers improve patient care while reducing their overall cost of care.
•Expand the Use of rainbow® Technology in Non-Hospital Settings. We believe the noninvasive measurement of hemoglobin, SpHb®, creates a significant opportunity in markets such as physician offices, emergency departments and blood donation centers; and the noninvasive measurement of carboxyhemoglobin, SpCO®, creates a significant opportunity in the fire/alternate care market.
•Expand the Use of Root® in Hospital Settings. We believe Root® represents a powerful paradigm in patient monitoring because it enhances our rainbow® and SET® measurements with multiple specialty parameters, including SedLine® brain function monitoring, O3® Regional Oximetry, and NomoLine® capnography and gas monitoring, and enables open-architecture connectivity in an integrated, clinician-centric hub. Our Hospital Automation™ integration platform for Root® provides a conduit to the patient’s EMR for a range of clinical devices that may otherwise remain disconnected, and therefore, unable to communicate their information. Hospital Automation™, in conjunction with the Iris® ports found on Root®, offers clinical utility and flexibility by collecting device information from multiple sources and making it available to clinicians in one networked place, akin to an airplane cockpit. Complementary innovations like the Radius-7® wearable, wireless monitor foster an environment of safety without sacrificing patient mobility or comfort. Radius-7® provides patients in medical-surgical units with mobility, allowing them to visit common areas and labs, all while being continuously monitored around the clock. Root® is acuity-adaptable, meaning it can be configured for any care area, and is competitively priced. 
•Expand Hospital Automation™ and Connectivity in Hospital Settings. We believe we can improve and automate the continuum of care through our connectivity platform by reducing complexity by integrating data from multiple disparate monitors and therapeutic devices through Root® and Iris® Gateway; by deploying decision support algorithms like Halo 
10


ION®; by saving time through semi-automated and automated bedside vital signs measurement and documentation with Patient SafetyNet™; by keeping patients connected with their care providers through Masimo SafetyNet™ and Rad 97® when they are discharged from hospitals; by improving data interpretation through adaptable and intuitive displays like UniView™, UniView : 60™ and MyView®; and through remote monitoring via Patient SafetyNet™ and Replica™.
•Utilize our Customer Base and OEM Relationships to Market Masimo rainbow SET®, O3®, SedLine® and Capnography Products Incorporating Licensed rainbow® Technology. We currently sell rainbow SET® products through our direct sales force and distributors. We include our MX circuit boards in our pulse oximeters and also sell them to our OEM partners. Our MX circuit boards are equipped with circuitry to support rainbow® Pulse CO-Oximetry measurements that can be activated at time of sale or through a subsequent software upgrade. We believe that, over time, the clinical need for these measurements, along with our installed customer base, will help drive the adoption of our rainbow® Pulse CO-Oximetry products.
•Continue to Innovate and Maintain Our Technology Leadership Position. We invented and pioneered the first pulse oximeter to accurately measure arterial blood oxygen saturation level and pulse rate in the presence of motion artifact and low perfusion. In addition, we launched our rainbow SET® platform that enabled what we believe is the first noninvasive monitoring of carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin and hemoglobin, as well as PVi®, all of which were previously only available with invasive and/or complicated testing. Furthermore, we believe that our introduction of RRa® with RAM® technology represented the first platform to enable noninvasive and continuous respiration monitoring through an easy-to-use single-patient adhesive acoustic sensor. Finally, we believe that our recent introduction of ORi™ may provide advance warning of an impending hypoxic state, or an indication of an unintended hyperoxic state.
•Expand Masimo technology into the personal health consumer and home market. Our first general wellness and personal health consumer and home market application was the MightySat®, a fingertip pulse oximeter with five important health and breathing measurements that was targeted at sports, fitness and relaxation. These values include: O2, PR, RRp®, PI and PVI®. In the past two years, we launched six additional products for the consumer and home market. We released the Radius T°™, a means to monitor a loved one’s fever in a hassle-free continuous manner; Masimo Sleep™, a means to help you understand what is going on in your body that may be impacting your sleep; Bridge™, the first FDA-cleared, drug-free, non-surgical device to use neuromodulation to aid in the reduction of symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal; Masimo Doctella, a secure, cloud-based platform that allows providers to customize interactive digital CarePrograms™ for their patients from the hospital to the home by helping them view patient inputs and compliance with treatment plans, interpret physiological data, and collect population health data; SafetyNet-OPEN™, a remote patient management solution for tracking key vital signs at the organizational level; and finally, SafetyNet-Alert™, a remote patient management solution for tracking key vital signs at home. We believe that in the home setting, accurate monitoring with Masimo SET® and Masimo SafetyNet Alert™ may help reduce the risk of opioid overdose by alerting family members and others when opioids have slowed a patient’s breathing and caused a significant drop in oxygen saturation.
•Expand the Masimo product portfolio through strategic investments and acquisitions. In 2020 and 2021, we successfully completed three strategic acquisitions and an exclusive license agreement, all of which are currently being integrated into our product portfolio. In addition, on February 15, 2022, we announced our entry into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Sound United, a consumer technology company that owns a portfolio of premium brands. We continually evaluate new and exciting opportunities to expand our product portfolio. We pursue the opportunities that we believe will add stockholder value, can be successfully integrated within our business and show positive potential to achieve our business and financial objectives.
We plan to continue to innovate and develop new technologies and products, internally and through our collaboration with Cercacor, from whom we currently license certain rainbow® technologies.
Our future growth strategy is also closely tied to our focus on international expansion opportunities. Since 2007, we have continued to expand our sales and marketing presence in Europe, Asia, Asia Pacific, Middle East, Canada and Latin America. We have accomplished this by both additional staffing and adding or expanding sales offices in many of these territories. By centralizing a portion of our international operations, including sales management, marketing, customer support, planning, logistics and administrative functions, in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, we believe we have developed a more efficient and scalable international organization that is capable of being even more responsive to the business needs of our international customers under this centralized management structure.

Circuit Boards
Masimo SET® MS Circuit Boards. Our Masimo SET® MS circuit boards perform all signal processing and other pulse oximetry functions incorporating the Masimo SET® platform. Our MS circuit boards are included in our proprietary monitors or sold to our OEM partners for incorporation into their monitors. Once incorporated into a pulse oximeter, the MS circuit boards perform all data acquisition processing and report the pulse oximetry measurements to the host monitor. The circuit boards and related software interface directly with our proprietary sensors to calculate SpO2, PR and Pi. Our latest MSX family of circuit boards provide Masimo SET® SpO2, PR, and Pi in a variety of small form factors with a typical power consumption of only 45 milliwatts.
uSpO2® Cable/Board. Our SET® technology-in-a-cable contains the low power (MS-2040) technology in a reduced size, allowing it to be embedded into patient cables as part of the sensor connector. This allows the uSpO2® cable/board to interface with monitoring devices externally via an existing communications port in instances where internal integration of a traditional Masimo SET® technology board is not feasible. The uSpO2® cable/board provides the same Masimo SET® Measure-through Motion and Low Perfusion™ pulse oximetry found in our other products, with a typical power consumption of less than 45 milliwatts.

Monitors / Devices
Root®. Root® is a powerful patient monitoring and connectivity platform that integrates our rainbow® and SET® measurements with multiple additional specialty measurements through MOC-9® open architecture technology in an integrated, clinician-centric platform. The first MOC-9® technologies developed by Masimo were SedLine® brain function monitoring, NomoLine® capnography and gas monitoring and O3® Regional Oximetry. Root® with NomoLine® capnography, SedLine® brain function monitoring, wireless communication and Iris® connectivity for third-party medical devices has received FDA 510(k) clearance. O3® Regional Oximetry has received the CE Mark and FDA 510(k) clearance.
Early Warning Signs (EWS) for Root® aggregates information from multiple vital signs and clinical observations to generate a score that represents the potential degree of patient deterioration. There are several EWS protocols, such as the Pediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS), Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and National Early Warning Score (NEWS). These various scores require vital signs contributors such as oxygen saturation, pulse rate, respiration rate, body temperature and systolic blood pressure along with contributors input by clinicians, such as level of consciousness, use of supplemental oxygen and urine output. The weighting and number of contributors differ depending upon which EWS protocol is used. Root® can be customized for various predefined EWS protocols, or hospitals can configure their own set of required contributors, and their relative weights, to create an EWS unique to their care environment.
Our MOC-9® partnerships enable third parties to utilize Root®’s open architecture and built-in connectivity to independently develop, obtain regulatory approvals, and commercialize their own external MOC-9® module. Alternatively, third parties can develop Masimo Open Connect Control™ (MOC-C™) applications for Root® using the MOC-9® software development kit (SDK). While we support the development efforts of our MOC® partners as needed, and help increase awareness of the availability of non-Masimo MOC-9® modules and MOC-C™ applications, our MOC-9® partners use their existing distribution channels to sell their MOC-9® modules or MOC-C™ applications to customers. 
Pathway™, a newborn oxygenation visualization mode for Root®, provides clinicians with a way to visualize a hospital’s recommended resuscitation protocol for a newborn’s oxygen saturation while continuously monitoring SpO2 and PR during the first ten minutes after birth.

Sensors
Sensors and Cables. We have developed one of the broadest lines of single-patient-use (disposable), reusable and rainbow® sensors and cables. In total, we have over 150 different types of sensors designed to meet virtually every clinical need. Masimo SET® sensors are uniquely designed to reduce interference from physiological and non-physiological noise. Our proprietary technology platforms operate only with our proprietary sensor lines. However, through the use of adapter cables, our sensors can be connected to certain competitor pulse oximetry monitors. We sell our sensors and cables to end-users directly or through our distributors and OEM partners.
Our single-patient-use sensors offer several advantages over reusable sensors, including improved performance, cleanliness, increased comfort and greater reliability. Our reusable sensors are primarily used for short-term, spot-check monitoring. 
RD SET®, RD rainbow SET®, and RD rainbow Lite SET®. Our RD family of sensors is designed to maximize patient comfort, optimize clinician workflow and reduce material waste. RD sensors are lightweight with no moving parts and a flat, soft cable with smooth edges. RD sensors are available in fold-over and wrap-around styles for a variety of patient types and clinical scenarios.

SofTouch™ Sensors. SofTouch™ sensors are designed with less or no adhesive for patients with compromised skin conditions. SofTouch™ sensors are available as single-patient sensors for newborns and multi-site reusable sensors for pediatrics and adults.
Trauma and Newborn Sensors. We have developed two specialty sensor lines, for trauma and resuscitation situations, as well as for newborns. These sensors contain an identifier that automatically sets the pulse oximeter to its maximum sensitivity and fastest settings, and allow for quick application, even in wet and slippery environments. Additionally, we introduced low-profile sensors LNCS® and M-LNCS® Neo, NeoPt and Inf sensors to monitor oxygen saturation in newborns. These sensors are smaller and thinner, making them significantly more comfortable for patients and easier for clinicians to apply.
Blue® Sensors. We believe our Blue® Sensors are the first FDA-cleared sensors to accurately monitor arterial blood oxygen saturation levels in cyanotic infants and children with abnormally low oxygen saturation levels.
E1® Ear Sensor. We believe that our E1® Ear Sensor is the first single-patient-use ear sensor that can be placed securely in the ear conchae, allowing clinicians to combine Masimo SET® performance and central monitoring to provide quick access and responsive assessment of oxygenation. The E1® Ear Sensor is designed for field emergency medical services utilization.
TFA-1® Adhesive Forehead Sensor. We designed our TFA-1® forehead sensor for hospitals desiring forehead monitoring using a disposable sensor. TFA-1® combines Masimo SET® performance with quick access and responsive oxygenation assessment.
rainbow® Sensors. We developed these proprietary, multi-wavelength sensors for use with our rainbow® Pulse CO-Oximetry products. In contrast to traditional sensors that only have the capability to monitor SpO2, and PR, our rainbow® sensors can also monitor SpCO®, SpMet® and SpHb®. Our licensed rainbow SET® sensors are the only sensors that are compatible with our licensed rainbow SET® products. Rainbow® sensors are available in single-patient-use, and reusable spot-check sensor types.
The rainbow® DCI®-mini is the first noninvasive hemoglobin spot-check sensor for infants and small children (weight 3 to 30 kg). Paired with our handheld Pronto® or Rad-67® devices, the rainbow® DCI®-mini sensors are designed to help clinicians quickly and easily spot-check hemoglobin levels in infants and small children, which may facilitate the identification of anemia. When paired with Rad-67®, the rainbow® DCI®-mini enables Next Generation SpHb® measurements. The rainbow® DCI®-mini has received the CE Mark in Europe and Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approval in Japan, but is not currently available for sale in the U.S. The rainbow® Super DCI®-mini sensor allows for the ability to measure SpHb®, SpCO®, SpMet® and SpO2 on the same noninvasive reusable sensor. The rainbow® Super DCI®-mini has received the CE Mark in Europe and MHLW approval in Japan, but is not currently available for sale in the U.S.
rainbow Acoustic® Sensors. We believe we were the first to market a continuous respiration rate monitoring technology based on an acoustic sensor placed on the patient’s neck. Our rainbow Acoustic® sensors detect the sounds associated with breathing and convert the sounds into continuous respiration rate using proprietary signal processing that is based on Masimo SET®. RAS-45, our single-use acoustic respiration sensor for RAM®, is designed to facilitate placement on and improve attachment to the neck. RAS-45 operates with Masimo MX circuit boards to measure RRa® and display an acoustic respiration wave form. Like the RAS-125c sensor, RAS-45 operates with Masimo MX technology boards to measure RRa®, display the acoustic respiration wave form and optionally allow clinicians to listen to the sound of breathing. Both the RAS-45 and RAS-125c are available in CE Marked countries and the U.S. for adult and pediatric patients who weigh more than 10 kg. RAS-45 has received the CE Mark and FDA 510(k) clearance.
SedLine® Sensor. Used with the SedLine® MOC-9® module for the Root® patient monitoring and connectivity platform, the SedLine® sensor is a disposable sensor that collects EEG data for our SedLine® monitor. RD SedLine™ sensors feature a repositioned, color-coded sensor-cable connection that lies comfortably on the patient’s head and soft foam pads to reduce discomfort upon application to the patient.
O3® Sensors. Used with the O3® MOC-9® module for the Root® patient monitor, each O3® sensor contains four light-emitting diodes and two detectors to continuously measure rSO2. Our pediatric application of O3® regional oximetry with the O3® pediatric sensor for both adult patients and pediatric patients weighing more than 5 kg (11 lbs) and less than 40 kg (88 lbs) has received FDA 510(k) clearance. O3® sensors for use with infants and neonatal patients has also received FDA 510(k) clearance.
Centroid™. Centroid™ is a wearable wireless patient orientation, activity and respiration rate sensor. Centroid™ helps clinicians monitor a patient’s position to avoid preventable pressure ulcers and can alert clinicians to sudden movements such as fall-like events. In addition, Centroid™ detects chest movements to continuously provide respiration rate, providing clinicians with additional data that may inform care decisions. Centroid™ pairs with the Root® platform using Bluetooth® to track a patient’s posture, orientation and activity. The data transmitted by Centroid™ can be displayed in various formats on Root®, giving clinicians multiple ways to assess adherence to protocols regarding tissue stress and to tailor care to the specific needs of each patient.

Eve™ is intended to provide consistent application of the screening protocol to reduce method-and operator-induced variability and improve efficiency by automating the data capture and comparison between readings. Eve™ has received the CE Mark, but is currently not available for sale in the U.S.
X-Cal®
Sensor and cable failures can prevent pulse oximeters from providing the patient safety advantages that continuous pulse oximetry monitoring is intended to provide. Our X-Cal® technology enhances patient safety and improves clinician efficiency by preserving system quality, performance and reliability and reducing the chances of bad or inferior sensors and cables being used on patients. X-Cal® technology enhances the benefits of Masimo’s pulse oximetry by incorporating the means to track the expected monitoring life of our sensors and cables and provides appropriate user messaging on the host monitor.
X-Cal® addresses three common problems experienced by clinicians using an integrated Masimo system, including:
•Patient safety may be compromised by using counterfeit Masimo sensors and cables because they are not produced with comparable components, do not provide proper shielding from ambient interferences, create electrostatic noise caused by motion, do not have our quality and performance controls, and are not tested or warranted to work within a Masimo system;
•We design our sensors and cables to last well beyond their warranty period and customer feedback indicates our sensors and cables last significantly longer than competing products, but cable and sensor reliability may still be compromised when used beyond their intended life, affecting patient care and causing clinicians and biomedical engineers to spend time troubleshooting intermittent cable and sensor issues; and
•We believe that third-party reprocessed pulse oximetry sensors introduce challenges in the clinical environment due to potential quality issues. In fact, we believe that most third-party reprocessed sensors do not indicate that they are capable of performing in the same conditions as Masimo Measure-through Motion and Low Perfusion™ sensors or in neonatal applications, key performance requirements available with Masimo SET® sensors. To the best of our knowledge, no third-party company has attempted to reprocess rainbow SET® sensors.

Cercacor Laboratories, Inc.
Cercacor is an independent entity spun-off from us to our stockholders in 1998. Joe Kiani, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is also the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cercacor. We are a party to a cross-licensing agreement with Cercacor, which was amended and restated effective January 1, 2007 (the Cross-Licensing Agreement), which governs each party’s rights to certain intellectual property held by the two companies.
The following table outlines our rights under the Cross-Licensing Agreement relating to specific end-user markets and the related technology applications of specific measurements.

 | End-User Markets 
Measurements | Professional Caregiver andAlternate Care Market | Patient and Pharmacist 
Vital Signs(1) | Masimo(owns) | Cercacor(non-exclusive license) 
Non-Vital Signs(2) | Masimo(exclusive license) | Cercacor(owns or exclusive license)

______________
(1)Vital signs measurements include, but are not limited to, SpO2, peripheral venous oxygen saturation, mixed venous oxygen saturation, fetal oximetry, sudden infant death syndrome, ECG, blood pressure (noninvasive blood pressure, invasive blood pressure and continuous noninvasive blood pressure), temperature, respiration rate, CO2, pulse rate, cardiac output, EEG, perfusion index, depth of anesthesia, cerebral oximetry, tissue oximetry and/or EMG, and associated features derived from these measurements, such as 3D alarm®, PVi® and other features.
(2)Non-vital signs measurements include the body fluid constituents other than vital signs measurements and include, but are not limited to, carbon monoxide, methemoglobin, blood glucose, hemoglobin and bilirubin.
Our License to Cercacor. We granted Cercacor an exclusive, perpetual and worldwide license, with sublicense rights, to use our Masimo SET® technology, including all improvements, for the monitoring of non-vital signs measurements and to develop and sell devices incorporating Masimo SET® for monitoring non-vital signs measurements in the “Cercacor Market”. The Cercacor Market consists of any product market in which a product is intended to be used by a patient or pharmacist rather than a professional medical caregiver regardless of the particular location of the sale, including sales to doctors, hospitals, alternate care market professionals or otherwise, provided the product is intended to be recommended, or resold, for use by the patient or pharmacist. We also granted Cercacor a non-exclusive, perpetual and worldwide license, with sublicense rights, to use Masimo SET® for the measurement of vital signs in the Cercacor Market. In exchange, Cercacor pays us a 10% royalty on the amount of vital signs sensors and accessories sold by Cercacor.
Cercacor’s License to us. We exclusively license from Cercacor the right to make and distribute products in the “Masimo Market” that utilize rainbow® technology for the measurement of carbon monoxide, methemoglobin, fractional arterial oxygen saturation, and hemoglobin, which includes hematocrit. The Masimo Market consists of any product market where the product is intended to be used by a professional medical caregiver, including hospital caregivers, surgicenter caregivers, paramedic vehicle caregivers, doctors’ offices caregivers, alternate care facility caregivers and vehicles where alternative care services are provided. We also have the option to obtain exclusive licenses to make and distribute products in the Masimo Market that utilize rainbow® technology for the monitoring of other non-vital signs measurements, including blood glucose. We have 180 days after proof of feasibility to exercise the above-referenced option to obtain a license for the measurement of blood glucose for an additional $2.5 million and licenses for other non-vital signs measurements for an additional $0.5 million each. The licenses are exclusive until the later of 20 years from the grant of the applicable license or the expiration of the last patent included in the rainbow® technology related to the applicable measurements. To date, we have developed and commercially released devices that measure carbon monoxide, methemoglobin and hemoglobin using licensed rainbow® technology. We also make and distribute products that monitor respiration rate via rainbow Acoustic Monitoring®, which is a Masimo-developed rainbow® technology and, therefore, is not required to be licensed from Cercacor. 
Our license to use rainbow® technology for these measurements in these markets is exclusive on the condition that we continue to pay Cercacor royalties on our products incorporating rainbow® technology, subject to certain minimum aggregate royalty thresholds, and that we use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or market products incorporating the licensed rainbow® technology. The royalty is up to 10% of the rainbow® royalty base, which includes handhelds, tabletop and multiparameter devices. Handheld products incorporating rainbow® technology carry a 10% royalty rate. For other products, only the proportional amount attributable to that portion of our devices used to monitor non-vital signs measurements, rather than to monitor vital signs measurements, and sensors and accessories for measuring only non-vital sign parameters are included in the 10% rainbow® royalty base. For multiparameter devices, the rainbow® royalty base includes the percentage of the revenue based on the number of rainbow®-enabled measurements.
For hospital contracts where we place equipment and enter into a sensor contract, we pay a royalty to Cercacor on the total sensor contract revenue based on the ratio of rainbow®-enabled devices to total devices. Pursuant to the terms of the license, we are subject to certain specific annual minimum aggregate royalty payment obligations of $5.0 million per year.
Change in Control. The Cross-Licensing Agreement provides that, upon a change in control:
•if the surviving or acquiring entity ceases to use “Masimo” as a company name and trademark, all rights to the “Masimo” trademark will be assigned to Cercacor;
•the option to license technology developed by Cercacor for use in blood glucose monitoring will be deemed automatically exercised and a $2.5 million license fee for this technology will become immediately payable to Cercacor; and
•the minimum aggregate annual royalties payable to Cercacor for carbon monoxide, methemoglobin, fractional arterial oxygen saturation, hemoglobin and/or glucose will increase to $15.0 million per year until the exclusivity period of the agreement ends, plus up to $2.0 million for each additional measurement with no maximum ceiling for non-vital sign measurements. 
For purposes of the Cross-Licensing Agreement, a change in control includes any of the following with respect to us or Cercacor:
•the sale of all or substantially all of either company’s assets to a non-affiliated third-party;
•the acquisition by a non-affiliated third-party of 50% or more of the voting power of either company;
•Joe Kiani, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Executive Officer of Cercacor, resigns or is terminated from his position with either company; or
•the merger or consolidation of either company with a non-affiliated third-party.
Ownership of Improvements. Any improvements to Masimo SET® or rainbow® technology made by Cercacor, by us, or jointly by Cercacor with us or with any third-party that relates to non-vital signs monitoring, and any new technology acquired by Cercacor, is and will be owned by Cercacor. Any improvements to the Masimo SET® platform or rainbow® technology made by Cercacor, by us, or jointly by Cercacor with us or with any third-party that relates to vital signs monitoring, and any new technology acquired by us, is and will be owned by us. However, for both non-vital signs and vital signs monitoring, any improvements to the technology, excluding acquired technology, will be assigned to the other party and will be subject to the terms of the licenses granted under the Cross-Licensing Agreement. Any new non-vital signs monitoring technology utilizing Masimo SET® that we develop will be owned by Cercacor and will be subject to the same license and option fees as if it had been developed by Cercacor. Also, we will not be reimbursed by Cercacor for our expenses relating to the development of any such technology.
Other Agreements with Cercacor. We have also entered into various other agreements with Cercacor, including an Administrative Services Agreement, a Consulting Services Agreement and a Sublease Agreement. See Note 3 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on these agreements and other transactions with Cercacor.
Government Regulation
As a global medical technology company, we are subject to significant government regulation, compliance requirements, fees and costs, both in the U.S. and abroad. These regulatory requirements subject our products and our business to numerous risks that are specifically discussed within “Risks Related to Our Regulatory Environment” under Part I, Item 1A—“Risk Factors” within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A summary of certain critical aspects of our regulatory environment is included below.
Product Clearance and Approval Requirements
Many of our products are regulated by numerous government agencies, the most significant of which are the U.S. FDA, the national authorities in the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK), and MHLW in Japan. In addition, there are government agencies that regulate our products in other countries, whose requirements vary substantially from country to country. These agencies require us to comply with laws that regulate the design, development, clinical trials, testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, import, export and promotion of many of our products. 
In the U.S., unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we wish to market in the U.S. must, generally, first receive from the FDA either clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or approval of a premarket application (PMA). In some cases, the device may be authorized by FDA through the de novo classification process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process requires us to show that our new medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed “predicate” medical device and usually takes from four to nine months, but it may take longer. The PMA process requires us to demonstrate through valid scientific evidence that there is reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. The PMA process is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the process of obtaining 510(k) clearance. Both 510(k) and PMA submissions are subject to user fees. The FDA determines the appropriate process based on the risk classification of the medical device. There are three classifications, from Class I to Class III. The majority of our current regulated products have been deemed Class II devices, requiring 510(k) clearance, while some have been deemed Class I devices.
Most of our OEM partners are required to obtain clearance or approval of their devices that incorporate Masimo’s technologies, like Masimo SET® technology, Masimo rainbow SET® technology, Masimo Board-in-Cable technology, or are used with Masimo’s sensors. We generally grant our OEM partners a right to cross-reference the 510(k) submission files from our cleared Masimo SET® circuit boards, sensors, cables and notification systems.
In the EU, medical devices are currently subject to the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD). Under the MDD, a medical device may only be placed on the market within the EU if it conforms to certain “essential requirements”. Key requirements include that a medical device achieves its intended performance and does not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients or the safety and health of users and others, and bears the CE Mark. A medical device that conforms to such essential requirements can bear a CE Mark, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. Each medical device that we wish to market in the EU must conform to these requirements.
Conformity is determined through an assessment procedure, which depends upon the risk classification of the device. For our EU medical devices, conformity assessment generally involves a notified body. Notified bodies are often private entities that are authorized or licensed by government authorities to perform, or otherwise have oversight over, such assessments. Notified bodies may also review a manufacturer’s quality systems. If the conformity assessment is successfully completed, the manufacturer may apply a CE Mark to the product. This allows the general commercializing of a product in the EU. However, the product can also be subject to local registration requirements depending on the country. 
On May 26, 2021, the existing MDD was repealed and replaced by the Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR). The MDR is similar to the MDD, though it includes significantly more stringent requirements, notably stronger conformity assessment procedures, greater control over notified bodies and their standards, increased transparency, and more robust device vigilance requirements. The MDR applies to the medical devices we commercialize in the EU after May 26, 2021. However, the MDR is subject to certain transitional periods that enable certain notified body certificates to remain valid beyond 2021. For some of our devices, this could be as late as May 2024. 
The UK exited the EU on December 31, 2020 (Brexit). The UK does not intend to implement the MDR into the laws of Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). Northern Ireland is an exception where the MDR will continue to apply. Great Britain instead introduced a new, standalone medical devices framework. Currently, this aligns closely to the MDD. Instead of a CE Mark, medical devices marketed in Great Britain must bear a UKCA Mark. However, EU CE Marks will continue to be recognized in Great Britain until June 30, 2023, as will certificates issued by EU-recognized notified bodies. This arrangement is not reciprocated in the EU. Each medical device that we wish to market in the UK must comply with the national laws in the UK, which going forward may differ from the laws in the EU.
Continuing FDA Regulation
Clinical trials involving medical devices are subject to FDA regulation. Among other requirements, clinical trial sponsors must comply with requirements related to informed consent, Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, monitoring, reporting, record-keeping, labeling and promotion. If the study involves a significant risk device, the sponsor must obtain FDA approval of an investigational device exemption in addition to IRB approval prior to beginning the study. Information regarding certain device clinical trials must also be submitted to a public database maintained by the National Institutes of Health. 
After a device is approved and placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These regulatory requirements include, but are not limited to, the following: product listing and establishment registration; adherence to the Quality System Regulation (QSR) which requires stringent testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance 
procedures for the design, manufacture, storage and handling of devices; labeling requirements and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of off-label uses or indications; adverse event and device malfunction reporting; post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval clinical trials or other required testing; post-market surveillance requirements; the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask for, or require, the recall of products from the market; and requirements relating to voluntary corrections or removals. Device manufacturers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to evaluate compliance with these requirements.
Advertising and Promotion
Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and by federal and state regulatory and enforcement authorities, including the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and various state attorneys general. Although physicians are permitted to use their medical judgment to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, we may not promote our products for such “off-label” uses and can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Other companies’ promotional activities for their FDA-regulated products have been the subject of FTC enforcement actions brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. FTC enforcement actions often result in consent decrees that constrain future actions. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. 
Import and Export Requirements 
To import a device, the importer must file an entry notice and bond with the United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP). All devices are subject to FDA examination before release from CBP. Any article that appears to be in violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (FDCA) may be refused admission and a notice of detention and hearing may be issued. If the FDA ultimately refuses admission, the CBP may issue a notice for redelivery and, if a company fails to redeliver the goods or otherwise satisfy CBP and the FDA with respect to their disposition, may assess liquidated damages for up to three times the value of the lot. The CBP also imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products, including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance. 
Products exported from the United States are subject to foreign countries’ import requirements and the exporting requirements of the FDA or European regulating bodies, as applicable. In particular, international sales of medical devices manufactured in the United States that are not approved or cleared by the FDA for use in the United States, or are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. 
Foreign countries often require, among other things, a Certificate of Foreign Government (CFG) for export. To obtain a CFG, the device manufacturer must apply to the FDA. The FDA certifies that the product has been granted clearance or approval in the United States and that the manufacturing facilities were in compliance with the FDA’s QSR regulations at the time of the last FDA inspection.
Conflict Minerals and Supply Chain
We are subject to certain SEC rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act concerning “conflict minerals” (generally tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold), From January 1, 2021, similar rules are in force in the EU. Certain of these conflict minerals are used in the manufacture of our products. Although the U.S. rules are being challenged in court, in their present form they require us to investigate the source of any conflict minerals necessary to the production or functionality of our products. If any such conflict minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries (the DRC region), we must undertake comprehensive due diligence to determine whether such minerals financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC region. Since our supply chain is complex, our ongoing compliance with these rules could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of conflict minerals used in the manufacture of our products.
We are also subject to disclosure requirements regarding abusive labor practices in portions of our supply chain under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. 
Environmental
Our manufacturing processes involve the use, generation and disposal of solid wastes, hazardous materials and hazardous wastes, including silicone adhesives, solder and solder paste, sealants, epoxies and various solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. As such, we are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the use, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Products that we sell in Europe are subject to regulation in EU markets under the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS). RoHS prohibits companies from selling products which contain certain hazardous materials, including lead, mercury, cadmium, chromium, polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers, in EU member states. In addition, the EU’s Regulation-Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals Directive also restricts substances of very high concern in products.
Future environmental laws may require us to alter our manufacturing processes, thereby increasing our manufacturing costs. We believe that our products and manufacturing processes at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws; however, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated.
Health Care Fraud and Abuse
In the U.S., there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or other health-related business. For example, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)) prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any bribe, kickback or other remuneration intended to induce the referral of patients for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, health care products and services reimbursed by a federal health care program, including Medicare and Medicaid. Recognizing that the federal anti-kickback law is broad and potentially applicable to many commonplace arrangements, Congress and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) within the Department of Health and Human Services have created statutory “exceptions” and regulatory “safe harbors”. Exceptions and safe harbors exist for a number of arrangements relevant to our business, including, among other things, payments to bona fide employees, certain discount and rebate arrangements, and certain payment arrangements involving Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs).
Although an arrangement that fits into one or more of these exceptions or safe harbors is immune from prosecution, arrangements that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor do not necessarily violate the law, but the OIG or other government enforcement authorities may examine the practice to determine whether it involves the sorts of abuses that the statute was designed to combat. Violations of this federal law can result in significant penalties, including imprisonment, monetary fines and assessments, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. Exclusion of a manufacturer, like us, would preclude any federal health care program from paying for its products. In addition to the federal anti-kickback law, many states have their own laws that are analogous to the federal anti-kickback law, but may apply regardless of whether any federal or state health care program business is involved. Federal and state anti-kickback laws may affect our sales, marketing and promotional activities, educational programs, pricing and discount practices and policies, and relationships with health care providers by limiting the kinds of arrangements we may have with hospitals, alternate care market providers, GPOs, physicians, payers and others in a position to purchase or recommend our products.
Federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. For example, the Federal Civil False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. § 3729 et seq.) imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly and willfully presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program, including Medicaid and Medicare. Some suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by a “whistleblower” or “relator” on behalf of the government and such individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Manufacturers, like us, can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government, where they are found to have caused submission of false claims by, among other things, providing incorrect coding or billing advice about their products to customers that file claims, or by engaging in kickback arrangements or off-label promotion with customers that file claims. A number of states also have false claims laws, and some of these laws may apply to claims for items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and/or commercial insurance. Sanctions under these federal and state fraud and abuse laws may include civil monetary penalties and criminal fines, exclusion from government health care programs and imprisonment.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created new federal crimes, including health care fraud and false statements related to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including those offered by private payers. The false statements statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services. A violation of either statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment and other significant penalties.
The Physician Payment Sunshine Act (Sunshine Act), which was enacted by Congress as part of the ACA, requires medical device companies to track and publicly report, with limited exceptions, all payments and transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals in the U.S. Companies are required to track payments made and to report such payments to the government by March 31 of each year. Several states have similar requirements. Beginning in 2022, the reporting requirement also applies to advance practice nurses and physician assistants.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.
Due to the breadth of some of these laws, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws. In addition, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws. Evolving interpretations of current laws or the adoption of new federal or state laws or regulations could adversely affect many of the arrangements we have with customers and physicians. Therefore, our risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that some of these laws are broad and open to interpretation.
Data Privacy and Protection of Health and Other Personal Information
Data protection legislation is becoming increasingly common in the United States at both the federal and state level. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which became effective on January 1, 2020, requires us to make disclosures to consumers about our data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties, and provides a cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA, together with the Consumer Privacy Rights Act, which will be effective beginning January 1, 2023, is the most comprehensive data privacy law in the United States, and could be the precursor to other similar legislation in other states or at the federal level. Internationally, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in May 2018 within the European Economic Area (EEA) and many EEA jurisdictions. Other jurisdictions outside of the EEA have also adopted their own data privacy and protection laws. We have implemented, and continue to implement, procedures and processes to comply with these regulations and, as international data privacy and protection laws continue to evolve, and as new regulations, interpretive guidance and enforcement information become available, we may incur incremental costs to modify our business practices to comply with these requirements. In addition, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents.
In addition, numerous federal, state and international laws and regulations, including HIPAA and GDPR, govern the collection, use and disclosure of patient-identifiable, protected health information (PHI) and other personal information. In the U.S., HIPAA applies to covered entities, which include most healthcare facilities that purchase and use our products, and their business associates. The HIPAA Privacy Rule restricts the use and disclosure of PHI, and requires covered entities and their business associates to safeguard that information and to provide certain rights to individuals with respect to that information. The HIPAA Security Rule establishes detailed requirements for safeguarding PHI transmitted or stored electronically.
Although we are not a covered entity, we are sometimes deemed by our customers to be a business associate of covered entities due to activities that we perform for or on behalf of covered entities, such as training customers on the use of our products or investigating product performance. As business associates, we are subject to many of the requirements of HIPAA and could be directly subject to HIPAA civil and criminal enforcement and the associated penalties for violation of the Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Rules.
The HIPAA standards also apply to the use and disclosure of PHI for research and generally require the covered entity performing the research to obtain the written authorization of the research subject (or an appropriate waiver) before providing that subject’s PHI to sponsors like us for purposes related to the research. These covered entities also typically impose contractual limitations on our use and disclosure of the PHI they disclose to us. We may be required to make costly system modifications to comply with the privacy and security requirements that will be imposed on us and our failure to comply may result in liability and adversely affect our business. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of health information, and these laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business.
Third-Party Reimbursement
Health care providers, including hospitals, that purchase our products generally rely on third-party payers, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private payers, including indemnity insurers and managed care plans, to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of the products and the procedures in which they are used. As a result, demand for our products is dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payers. No uniform coverage or reimbursement policy for medical technology exists among all third-party payers, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payer to payer.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program. Along with its contractors, CMS establishes the coverage and reimbursement policies for the Medicare program. Because a large percentage of our products are used in the treatment of elderly or disabled individuals who are Medicare beneficiaries, Medicare’s coverage and reimbursement policies are particularly significant to our business. In addition, private payers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare.
In general, Medicare will cover a medical product or procedure when the product or procedure is included within a statutory benefit category and is reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury, or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part. Even if the medical product or procedure is considered medically necessary and coverage is available, Medicare may place restrictions on the circumstances where it provides coverage. For example, several Medicare local contractors have issued policies that restrict coverage for pulse oximetry in hospital inpatient and outpatient settings to a limited number of conditions, including limiting coverage to patients who (i) exhibit signs of acute respiratory dysfunction, (ii) have chronic lung disease, severe cardiopulmonary disease or neuromuscular disease involving the muscles of respiration, (iii) are under treatment with a medication with known pulmonary toxicity, or (iv) have sustained multiple trauma or complaints of acute chest pain.
Reimbursement for our products may vary not only by the type of payer involved but also based upon the setting in which the product is furnished and utilized. For example, Medicare payment may be made, in appropriate cases, for patient stays in the hospital inpatient and in outpatient settings involving the use of our products. Medicare generally reimburses hospitals based upon prospectively determined amounts. For hospital inpatient stays, the prospective payment generally is determined by the patient’s condition and other patient data and procedures performed during the inpatient stay, using a classification system known as Medicare Severity Diagnosis-Related Groups (MS-DRGs). Prospective rates are adjusted for, among other things, regional differences, co-morbidity and complications. Hospitals generally do not receive separate Medicare reimbursement for the specific costs of purchasing our products for use in the inpatient setting. Rather, Medicare reimbursement for these costs is deemed to be included within the prospective payments made to hospitals for the inpatient services in which the products are utilized.
In contrast, some differences may be seen in the reimbursement for use of our products in hospital outpatient departments. In this setting, Medicare payments also are generally made under a prospective payment system based on the ambulatory payment classifications (APCs) under which individual items and procedures are categorized. Hospitals receive the applicable APC payment rate for the procedure regardless of the actual cost for such treatment. Some outpatient services such as oximetry services do not receive separate reimbursement. Rather, their reimbursement is deemed packaged into the APC for an associated procedure and the payment for that APC does not vary whether or not the packaged procedure is performed. Some procedures also are paid through composite APCs, which are APCs that establish a payment rate that applies when a specific combination of services is provided.
Reimbursement for certain pulse oximetry monitoring services, including those using our products, may be separately payable when they are the only service provided to the patient on that day, packaged if provided with certain critical care services, or reimbursed through a composite APC when provided in connection with certain other services.
Because payments through the Prospective Payment System in both the hospital inpatient and outpatient settings are based on predetermined rates and may be less than a hospital’s actual costs in furnishing care, hospitals have incentives to lower their operating costs by utilizing products that will reduce the length of inpatient stays, decrease labor or otherwise lower their costs. If hospitals cannot obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products, or the procedures in which they are used, we cannot be certain that they will purchase our products, despite the clinical benefits and opportunity for cost savings that we believe can be derived from their use.
Our success with rainbow SET® technologies in U.S. settings of care with reimbursable monitoring procedures, such as hospital emergency departments, hospital procedure labs, and physician offices may largely depend on the ability of providers to receive reimbursement for such procedures. While private insurance payers often follow Medicare coverage and payment, we cannot be certain of this and, in many cases, cannot control the coverage or payment rates that private insurance payers put in place. In addition, the potential amendment, repeal or judicial invalidation of the ACA, and/or the enactment of other legislation or regulations, could affect future payment for services involving the use of our products.
Our success in non-U.S. markets depends largely upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from the third-party payers through which health care providers are paid in those markets. Health care payment systems in non-U.S. markets vary significantly by country, and include single-payer government managed systems, as well as systems in which private payers and government managed systems exist side-by-side. Our ability to achieve market acceptance or significant sales volume in international markets we enter will be dependent in large part on the availability of reimbursement for procedures performed using our products under health care payment systems in such markets. 
Other U.S. and Foreign Regulation
We and our OEM partners also must comply with numerous federal, state and local laws, as well as laws in other jurisdictions, relating to matters such as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and hazardous substance disposal. We cannot be sure that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future or that these laws or regulations will not hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new requirements could hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Markets
Competitive Conditions
The medical device industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. While we regard any company that sells pulse oximeters as a potential customer, we also recognize that the companies selling pulse oximeters on an OEM basis and/or pulse oximetry sensors are also potential competitors. Our primary competitor, Medtronic plc (Medtronic, formerly Covidien Ltd.), currently holds a substantial share of the pulse oximetry market. In addition, large technology companies that have not historically operated in the healthcare or medical device space, such as Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and others, have developed or may develop products and technologies that may compete with our current or future products and technologies in the consumer and clinical marketplaces.
Medtronic sells its own brand of Nellcor pulse oximeters to end-users, sells pulse oximetry modules to other monitoring companies on an OEM basis, and licenses to certain OEMs the right to make their pulse oximetry platforms compatible with their sensors. We also face substantial competition from larger medical device companies, including companies that develop products that compete with our proprietary Masimo SET® and our OEM partners. We believe that a number of companies have announced products that claim to offer motion-tolerant accuracy. In addition, some of our patents have expired and others will expire over time in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which they were issued.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the market for pulse oximetry products include:
•accurate monitoring during both patient motion and low perfusion;
•ability to introduce other clinically beneficial measurements related to oxygenation and respiration, such as noninvasive and continuous oxygen reserve index and hemoglobin;
•competitive pricing;
•brand recognition and perception of innovation abilities;
•sales and marketing capability;
•access to hospitals which are members of GPOs;
•access to integrated delivery networks;
•access to OEM partners; and
•patent protection.
Market Demand
We currently sell all of our medical products both directly to hospitals and the alternate care market via our sales force and various distributors in the U.S. and around the world, including Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, Canada and Australia. We sell our non-medical/consumer products through e-commerce Internet sites such as www.masimopersonalhealth.com and www.amazon.com.
Our sales and marketing strategy for pulse oximetry has been, and will continue to be, focused on building end-user awareness of the clinical and cost-saving benefits of our technologies. Our sales representatives’ primary focus is to facilitate the conversion of competitor accounts to our Masimo SET® pulse oximetry and rainbow SET® Pulse CO-Oximetry® products, to expand the use of Masimo SET® and Patient SafetyNet™ on the general floor and to create and expand the use of rainbow® measurements in both critical care and non-critical care areas. In addition to sales representatives, we employ clinical specialists to work with our sales representatives to educate end-users on the benefits of Masimo SET® and assist with the introduction and implementation of our technology and products to their sites. 
For the year ended January 1, 2022, two just-in-time distributors, Medline Industries and Cardinal Health, represented approximately 14.6% and 10.2%, respectively, of our total revenue. These were the only two customers that represented 10% or more of our revenue for the year ended January 2, 2021. Importantly, these two distributors take and fulfill orders from our 
direct customers, many of which have signed long-term sensor purchase agreements with us. If a specific just-in-time distributor is unable to fulfill these orders, the orders would be redirected to other distributors or fulfilled directly by us.
Additionally, we sell certain of our products through our OEM partners who incorporate our technologies into their monitors and sometimes resell our sensors to their installed base. Our OEM agreements allow us to expand the availability of our technologies through the sales and distribution channels of each OEM partner. To facilitate clinician awareness of Masimo technologies, our OEM partners have generally agreed to place the applicable Masimo trademark prominently on their instruments.
In order to facilitate our U.S. direct sales to hospitals, we have signed contracts with what we believe to be the five largest national GPOs in the U.S., based on the total volume of negotiated purchases. In return for the GPOs putting our products on contract, we have agreed to pay the GPOs a percentage of our revenue from their member hospitals. In 2021 and 2020, revenue from the sale of our pulse oximetry products to hospitals that are associated with GPOs amounted to $643.1 million and $564.0 million, respectively.
Resources
Intellectual Property
We believe that in order to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect our intellectual property.
We have developed a patent portfolio internally, and, to a lesser extent, through acquisitions and licensing, that covers many aspects of our product offerings. As of January 1, 2022, we had approximately 800 issued patents and approximately 500 pending applications in the U.S., Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada and other countries throughout the world. Our patents expire in accordance with the laws of the particular jurisdiction in which they were issued, which sometimes change. Additionally, as of January 1, 2022, we owned approximately 100 U.S. registered trademarks and approximately 500 foreign registered trademarks, as well as trade names that we use in conjunction with the sale of our products. Our trademarks are perpetually renewable.
Under the Cross-Licensing Agreement, we and Cercacor have agreed to allocate proprietary ownership of technology developed based on the functionality of the technology. We will have proprietary ownership, including ownership of all patents, copyrights and trade secrets, of all technology related to the noninvasive monitoring of vital signs measurements, and Cercacor will have proprietary ownership of all technology related to the noninvasive monitoring of non-vital signs measurements. We also rely upon trade secrets, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.
We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, in part, with confidentiality agreements with consultants, vendors and employees, although we cannot be certain that the agreements will not be breached or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach.
There are risks related to our intellectual property rights. For further detail on these risks, see “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” under Item 1A—“Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Research and Product Development
We believe that ongoing research and development efforts are essential to our success. Our research and development efforts focus primarily on continuing to enhance our technical expertise in pulse oximetry, expanding our noninvasive monitoring of other measurements and developing remote alarm and monitoring solutions.
Although we and Cercacor each have separate research and development projects, we collaborate with Cercacor on multiple research and development activities related to rainbow® technology and other technologies. Under the Cross-Licensing Agreement, the parties have agreed to allocate proprietary ownership of technology developed by either party based on the functionality of the technology. We will have proprietary rights to all technology related to the noninvasive measurement of vital signs measurements, and Cercacor will have proprietary ownership of all technology related to the noninvasive monitoring of non-vital signs measurements.
Manufacturing
Our strategy is to manufacture products in-house when it is efficient and cost-effective for us to do so. We currently manufacture our bedside and handheld pulse oximeters, our full line of disposable and reusable sensors and most of our patient cables in-house or through captive contract maquiladora operations. We maintain an approximate 70,700 square foot manufacturing facility in Irvine, California, and two separate manufacturing facilities in Mexicali and San Luis Rio Colorado, 
Mexico that have combined square footage of approximately 333,400 square feet. All three of these facilities are International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13485:2016 certified. We also maintain an approximate 86,500 square foot facility in Hudson, New Hampshire, a portion of which is used to manufacture advanced light emitting diodes and other advanced component-level technologies.
We will continue to utilize third-party contract manufacturers for products and subassemblies that can be more efficiently manufactured by these parties, such as our circuit boards. We monitor our third-party manufacturers and perform inspections and product tests at various steps in the manufacturing cycle to ensure compliance with our specifications. We also do full functional testing of our circuit boards.
For raw materials, we and our contract manufacturers rely on sole source suppliers for some components, including digital signal processor chips and analog-to-digital converter chips. We and our contract manufacturers have taken steps to minimize the impact of a shortage or stoppage of shipments of digital signal processor chips or analog to digital converter chips, including maintaining a safety stock of inventory and designing software that may be easily ported to another digital signal processor chip. We have agreements with certain major suppliers and each agreement provides for varying terms with respect to contract expiration, termination and pricing. Most of these agreements allow for termination upon specified notice, ranging from four to twelve months, to the non-terminating party. Certain of these agreements with our major suppliers allow for pricing adjustments, each agreement provides for annual pricing negotiation, and one agreement also guarantees us the most favorable pricing offered by the supplier to any of its other customers.
