 GENERAL
 We design and market Skechers-branded lifestyle footwear for men, women and children, performance footwear for men and women under the Skechers Performance brand name, and work footwear for men and women under Skechers Work brand name. We design and market Skechers branded lifestyle apparel, and license the Skechers brand to others for accessories, pet accessories, leather goods, eyewear and medical scrubs, among others. Skechers footwear reflects a combination of innovation, style, comfort, quality and value that appeals to a broad range of consumers. Our product offering is sold through wholesale distribution to department and specialty stores, athletic and independent retailers, and e-commerce retailers and directly to consumers through retail stores and digital sales. Our objective is to profitably grow our operations worldwide while leveraging our recognizable Skechers brand through our diversified product lines, innovative advertising and various distribution channels.
 We believe that brand recognition is an important element for success in the footwear business. We aggressively market our brands through comprehensive marketing campaigns for men, women and children. The Skechers brand is supported by print, television, digital, radio, outdoor and press campaigns as well as donation events for BOBS from Skechers. To further drive recognition, we enlist numerous celebrities, former and current athletes, and influencers to appear in our campaigns. In 2021, our brand ambassadors included Sugar Ray Leonard, Tony Romo, Howie Long, Cris Carter, Rusty Wallace and Brooke Burke, along with athletes Clayton Kershaw, Edward Cheserek, Meb Keflezighi, Colin Montgomerie and Brooke Henderson.
 Since 1992, when we introduced our first line, Skechers USA Sport Utility Footwear, we have expanded our product offering and grown our sales while substantially increasing the breadth and penetration of our account and customer base. Our men’s, women’s and children’s product lines benefit from the Skechers reputation for style, quality, comfort, innovation and affordability. Our Performance lines benefit from our marketing, product development, technology, and feedback from athletes and wear testers. To promote innovation and brand relevance, we manage our product lines through separate dedicated sales and design teams. 
SKECHERS LINES
 We offer a wide array of Skechers-branded footwear lines, many of which have categories that have developed into well-known names. Most of these categories are marketed and packaged with unique shoe boxes, hangtags and in-store support.
 Lifestyle Brands. Our lifestyle offering includes categories such as Skechers USA, Skechers Sport, Skechers Active, Modern Comfort, Skechers Street, Foamies, Mark Nason, the charity-minded BOBS from Skechers collection, among others.

Within our lifestyle collections are collaborations with known brands and properties—including street artists, designers and well-known animated characters.
 Performance Brands. Skechers Performance encompasses several technical footwear lines, each designed for specific activities to maximize performance and promote comfort. The Skechers Performance division designs footwear to utilize the latest advancements in materials and innovative design, including lightweight ULTRA GO and HYPER BURST midsole compounds for comfort and responsive feedback.

comfort technologies along with safety and durability features such as steel, composite and lightweight safety toes; high-abrasion soles; puncture resistance; waterproofing and electrostatic-dissipative technology.
 Skechers Apparel. Skechers designs and markets a collection of lifestyle apparel for men, women and kids. The collection features Skechers characteristics that consumers around the world have come to expect from the brand. The activewear garments are designed to directly coordinate with the brand’s footwear products. The Skechers apparel collection is sold at Skechers retail stores, on our websites and through wholesale customers.
PRODUCT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
 Our principal goal in product design is to develop innovative, comfortable, stylish, quality footwear at a reasonable price for the entire family. Our performance products are for professional and recreational athletes who want a technical shoe that performs under the demands of competition. Our occupational footwear is designed to meet the specifications and demands of the service, medical and construction industries while also meeting testing specifications in the markets where the product is sold.
 We believe that our products’ success is related to our ability to recognize trends in the footwear markets and to design products that anticipate and accommodate consumers’ ever-evolving preferences. Lifestyle trend information is compiled and analyzed by our designers in various ways, including reviewing and analyzing pop culture, clothing, and trend-setting media; consulting with our customers for information on current retail selling trends; participating in major footwear trade shows to stay abreast of popular brands, fashions and styles; and subscribing to various fashion and color information services. In addition, a key component of our design philosophy is to continually reinterpret and improve our most successful styles.
 SOURCING
 Factories. Our products are produced by independent contract manufacturers located primarily in Asia. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We believe that the use of independent manufacturers substantially increases our production flexibility and capacity, while reducing capital expenditures and avoiding the costs of managing a large production work force.
 When possible, we seek to use manufacturers that have previously produced our footwear, which we believe enhances continuity and quality while controlling production costs. To help avoid disruption of our product supply due to political instability, civil unrest, economic instability, changes in government policies or regulations, natural and manmade disasters, and other risks, we source product from multiple facilities across multiple countries. We believe that the existing production capacity at our third-party manufacturers’ facilities is sufficient to handle expected volume in the foreseeable future.
 Production Oversight. To safeguard product quality and consistency, we oversee the key aspects of production from initial prototype manufacture, through initial production runs, to final manufacture. Monitoring of all production is performed in the U.S. by our in-house production department and in Asia by staff working from our offices in China and Vietnam. We believe that our Asia presence allows us to negotiate supplier and manufacturer arrangements more effectively, decrease product turnaround time, and ensure timely delivery of finished footwear. In addition, we require our manufacturers to operate in a manner consistent with the Skechers Supplier Code of Conduct posted on our corporate website. We partner with factories that ensure humane conditions for their employees and we engage in routine auditing and monitoring procedures to ensure that those who contribute to our product are treated with the civility and respect they deserve.
 Quality Control. We believe quality control is an important and effective means of maintaining the quality and reputation of our products and brand. Our quality control program is designed to ensure finished goods meet our established design specifications and all goods bearing our trademarks meet our standards for quality. Our quality control personnel located in China and Vietnam perform an array of inspection procedures at various stages of the production process, including examination and testing of prototypes of key raw materials prior to manufacture, samples and materials at various stages of production and final products prior to shipment. Our employees are on-site at each of our major manufacturers to oversee production. For some of our lower volume manufacturers, our staff is on-site during significant production runs, or we will perform unannounced visits to their manufacturing sites to further monitor compliance with our manufacturing specifications.
 Sustainability. We believe sustainability is an important responsibility in managing our business. We recently launched Our Planet Matters, a collection of sustainable products utilizing recycled materials. We partnered with a global conservation organization to help fund their organization’s global efforts which align with our core values and commitment to reduce tree harvesting and emissions through packaging. 
 We worked to make our packaging more sustainable for the more-than-200 million units of Skechers that consumers purchased in 2021. Since 2016, we’ve reduced our products’ packaging plastics by 99% down to less than 1%; all of which are recyclable. Many facilities can now recycle 93% of Skechers-branded shoeboxes, and all of our foot forms and tissue paper packaging are recyclable and printed with soy-or water-based ink. Further, 99% of our shoeboxes meet the FSC® standard for responsible resources, and we continually look for new ways to improve with green materials, regular assessments, and assurance that our items are FSC-certified, recycled or ethically harvested. Our shipping methods reflect our green-minded approach to sustainability: master cartons are printed

with soy-or-water-based ink and are 100% recyclable, and at the distribution centers managing more than 90% of our business, our outbound shipping cartons are made with 96%-100% recycled materials and are 100% recyclable.
 Many of our facilities are designed and operated with sustainability in mind, including one of America’s largest LEED Gold certified facilities at our North America distribution center in Southern California. Our expanding corporate offices in Los Angeles, California are being designed and developed to qualify for LEED certification.
 ADVERTISING AND MARKETING
 With a marketing philosophy of “Unseen, Untold, Unsold,” we take a targeted approach to marketing to drive traffic, build brand recognition and properly position our diverse lines within the marketplace. Senior management is directly involved in shaping our image and the conception, development and implementation of our advertising and marketing activities. Our marketing plan has an omni-channel approach, and we utilize print, outdoor, television, radio, and digital, along with public relations, influencers and social media, promotions, and in-store events. In addition, we utilize celebrity endorsers in some of our advertisements. 
PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS 
 We have three reportable segments: Domestic Wholesale, International Wholesale, and Direct-to-Consumer. In the U.S., our products are available through a network of wholesale customers comprised of department, athletic and specialty stores and e-commerce retailers. Internationally, our products are available through wholesale customers in more than 180 countries and territories via our global network of distributors as well as through our subsidiaries in Asia, Europe, Canada, and Latin America. Skechers owns and operates retail stores both domestically and internationally through three integrated retail formats—concept, factory outlet and big box stores. Each of these channels serves an integral function in the global distribution of our products.
 Domestic Wholesale. We distribute our footwear domestically to department stores, wholesale clubs, specialty stores, athletic specialty shoe stores, independent retailers, and internet retailers. Skechers footwear is available through a variety of wholesale customers, many of whom operate stores within the same retail locations due to our distinct product lines, variety of styles and the price criteria of their specific customers. An integral component of our strategy is to offer our accounts the highest level of customer service so that our products will be fully represented in existing and new customer retail locations.
 International Wholesale. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories throughout the world. We generate revenues from outside the U.S. from sales to department stores, specialty, independent and internet retailers. To support our global operations, we have offices and showrooms in over 20 countries.
 Our subsidiaries and joint ventures merchandise, market and distribute Skechers product to generate sales in their countries, and we consolidate their results in our financial statements. Our joint venture interests include: China, Malaysia and Singapore (50%), Thailand and Israel (51%), Mexico (60%), and South Korea (65%). Where we do not sell directly through our international subsidiaries and joint ventures, our footwear is distributed through a network of distributors and licensees who sell our products to department, athletic and specialty stores. Our distributors, licensees and franchisees own and operate the following retail stores around the world:

 Direct-to-Consumer. We pursue our direct-to-consumer strategy through our integrated retail formats: e-commerce, concept stores, factory outlet and big box stores. Our formats enable us to promote the full Skechers product offering in an attractive environment that appeals to a broad group of consumers. 
  
• | E-commerce – Our company-owned e-commerce business enables consumers to shop, browse, find store locations, socially interact, post reviews, and immerse themselves in our brands. Additionally, the e-commerce business provides an efficient and effective retail distribution channel, which has improved our customer service and brand experience.

generally chosen to generate maximum marketing value for the Skechers brand name through signage, store front presentation and interior design. These stores also serve as marketing and product testing venues.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Factory Outlet Stores – Our factory outlet stores are generally located in manufacturers’ direct outlet centers in the U.S. and in select international markets. Our factory outlet stores provide opportunities for us to sell discontinued and excess merchandise. Unlike our big box stores, inventory in these stores is supplemented by certain first-line styles sold at full retail price points.

• | Big Box Stores – Our free-standing and attached big box stores, which are primarily located throughout the U.S. and Canada, enable us to liquidate excess merchandise, discontinued lines and odd-size inventory. We seek to open our big box stores in areas that are in close proximity to our concept stores to facilitate the timely transfer of inventory.

LICENSING
 We believe that selective licensing of the Skechers brand name and our product line names to manufacturers broadens and enhances the individual brands without requiring significant capital investments or additional incremental operating expenses. Our multiple product lines plus additional subcategories present many potential licensing opportunities on terms that we believe will provide more effective manufacturing, distribution or marketing of non-footwear products. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 25 active licensing agreements in which we are the licensor. These include a variety of Skechers-branded products including apparel, accessories, socks and eyewear; medical scrubs; fitness and yoga accessories, and cold weather products. Additional category-specific collections include Skechers Sport apparel, bags, backpacks and headwear; Twinkle Toes backpacks and lunchboxes; BOBS from Skechers socks and backpacks; and Skechers Work socks. We also have BOBS from Skechers pet accessories in Petco.
DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS
 We believe that strong distribution support is a critical factor in our operations. Our distribution network includes (i) an approximately 2.8 million square-foot North American distribution center located in California, (ii) an approximately 2.2 million square-foot European distribution center located in Belgium, (iii) an approximately 1.6 million square foot China distribution center, (iv) an approximately 0.3 million square foot United Kingdom distribution center, (v) company-operated distribution centers or third-party distribution centers in Central America, South America and Asia, and (vi) third-party manufacturers and other international third-party distribution centers.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
 We own and utilize a variety of trademarks, including the Skechers trademark. We have a significant number of both registrations and pending applications for our U.S. trademarks. In addition, we have trademark registrations and trademark applications in approximately 155 foreign countries. We have design patents and pending design and utility patent applications in both the U.S. and approximately 39 foreign countries. We continuously look to increase the number of our patents and trademarks both domestically and internationally, where necessary to protect valuable intellectual property. We regard our trademarks and other intellectual property as valuable assets and believe that they have significant value in marketing our products. We vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement, including through the use of cease and desist letters, administrative proceedings and lawsuits.
COMPETITION
 The global footwear industry is a competitive business. Although we believe that we do not compete directly with any single company with respect to its entire range of products, our products compete with other branded products within their product category as well as with private label products sold by retailers, including some of our customers. We also compete with numerous manufacturers, importers and distributors of footwear for the limited shelf space available for displaying such products to the consumer. Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing capacity allows ease of access by new market entrants. Some of our competitors are larger, have been in existence for a longer period of time, have strong brand recognition, have captured greater market share and/or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do.

HUMAN CAPITAL
 As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 11,700 persons, of whom approximately 6,200 were employed on a full-time basis and approximately 5,500 were employed on a part-time basis, primarily in our retail stores.
 Social Responsibility. As a family-focused brand, Skechers was founded on inclusivity, diversity, respect and entrepreneurial spirit with the philosophy of putting people first – offering comfort and care to our employees and customers. In conjunction with our policy against discrimination, Skechers emphasizes that every employee, applicant, contractor and customer is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. Human rights is a core value at the heart of how we conduct our business, at every level of our company – including our factories and suppliers. All full-time and part-time corporate employees in the U.S. undergo harassment and diversity training, and employees of our wholly-owned operations in other countries comply with their local laws regarding human rights, harassment and diversity training in the workplace. As it relates to our factories and suppliers specifically, we provide employee and management training to ensure that employees and companies who oversee our production and manufacturer auditing know the most current issues regarding human rights. Our Code of Ethics, Corporate Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct codify these values and our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.
 Skechers is also focused on reducing its carbon footprint. We have made environmental advancements a top priority at our corporate facilities. Now under construction, our expanding corporate offices remain future-focused as we incorporate our earth-friendly philosophy into our growing footprint. All four buildings are being designed to receive LEED Gold certification upon completion, and include solar panels.
 Community. Skechers encourages active participation in the greater community, with annual charity walks for children in the U.S. and around the world. We promote charitable giving and volunteering by sponsoring community service days along with blood drives, food drives, and shoe drives. Additionally, we regularly donate product to not-for-profit organizations. In 2021, the Company donated over 50,000 pairs of new shoes to those in need, $1.0 million in support of earthquake relief efforts in Haiti, and we formed a partnership with a global conservation organization to contribute to their efforts to protect the world’s lands and waters. 
 Health and Safety. Skechers’ lifestyle and performance product offering has shaped our culture with a focus on wellness, and a commitment to providing a safe and healthful work environment for all employees. The Company offers healthy lunch options, an in-house fitness consultant and corporate exercise programs. We offer paid time off to get the COVID-19 vaccine and provided on-site vaccination clinics for our corporate employees and our domestic distribution center employees. We made changes to our corporate facilities, increasing cleaning protocols and distributing personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies to employees; instituting temperature screenings; installing touchless doors and faucets in common areas; limiting building occupancy; and staggering work schedules.
 Talent. We offer competitive benefits in a casual, creative atmosphere and a fun, fast-paced environment where employees can always learn and grow. Employee benefits are designed to help employees and their families stay healthy, meet their financial goals, and help them balance their work and personal lives. Benefits include health and wellness programs, training and development programs, an employee stock purchase program, a childcare incentive program, on-site electric vehicle charging stations, and product discounts.
