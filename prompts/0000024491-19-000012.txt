Item 1. | BUSINESS

Cooper Tire & Rubber Company, with its subsidiaries (“Cooper” or the “Company”), is a leading manufacturer and marketer of replacement tires. It is the fifth largest tire manufacturer in North America and, according to a recognized trade source, the Cooper family of companies is the thirteenth largest tire company in the world based on sales. Cooper specializes in the design, manufacture, marketing and sales of passenger car, light truck, truck and bus radial ("TBR"), motorcycle and racing tires.
The Company is organized into four business segments: North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia. Each segment is managed separately. Additional information on the Company’s segments as reported, including their financial results, total assets, products, markets and presence in particular geographic areas, appears in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the “Business Segments” note to the consolidated financial statements.
Cooper Tire & Rubber Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1930 as the successor to a business originally founded in 1914. Based in Findlay, Ohio, Cooper and its family of companies currently operate in 14 countries, including 9 manufacturing facilities and 22 distribution centers. As of December 31, 2018, it employed 9,027 persons worldwide.
Business Segments
The Company has four segments under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280, “Segments”:

• | North America, composed of the Company’s operations in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada;


• | Latin America, composed of the Company’s operations in Mexico, Central America and South America;


• | Europe; and


• | Asia.

North America and Latin America meet the criteria for aggregation in accordance with ASC 280, as they are similar in their production and distribution processes and exhibit similar economic characteristics. The aggregated North America and Latin America segments are presented as “Americas Tire Operations” in the segment disclosure.
Both the Europe and Asia segments have been determined to be individually immaterial, as they do not meet the quantitative requirements for segment disclosure under ASC 280. In accordance with ASC 280, information about operating segments that are not reportable shall be combined and disclosed in an all other category separate from other reconciling items. As a result, these two segments have been combined in the segment operating results discussion. The results of the combined Europe and Asia segments are presented as “International Tire Operations” in the segment disclosure.
Americas Tire Operations Segment
The Americas Tire Operations segment manufactures and markets passenger car and light truck tires, primarily for sale in the U.S. replacement market. The segment also has a joint venture manufacturing operation in Mexico, Corporacion de Occidente SA de CV (“COOCSA”), which supplies passenger car tires to the North American, Mexican, Central American and South American markets. The segment also markets and distributes racing, TBR and motorcycle tires. The racing and motorcycle tires 
--

are manufactured by the Company’s European Operations segment and by others. TBR tires are sourced from China-based Qingdao Ge Rui Da Rubber Co., Ltd. ("GRT"), a majority-owned joint venture manufacturing facility, and through an off-take agreement that was entered with Prinx Chengshan (Shandong) Tire Company Ltd. ("PCT"), the Company's former joint venture. In December 2017, the Company signed an off-take agreement with Sailun (Vietnam) Co., Ltd. ("Sailun Vietnam"), effective from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020, as an additional source of TBR tires. On December 12, 2018, Cooper Tire & Rubber Company Vietnam Holding, LLC ("Cooper Vietnam"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Cooper, and Sailun Vietnam entered into an equity joint venture contract to establish a joint venture in Vietnam which will produce and sell TBR tires. The new joint venture is expected to begin producing tires in 2020. 
Major distribution channels and customers include independent tire dealers, wholesale distributors, regional and national retail tire chains, and large retail chains that sell tires as well as other automotive products. The segment does not currently sell its products directly to end users, except through three Company-owned retail stores. The segment sells a limited number of tires to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"). 
The segment operates in a highly competitive industry, which includes Bridgestone Corporation, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company and Groupe Michelin. These competitors are substantially larger than the Company and serve OEMs as well as the replacement tire market. The segment also faces competition from low-cost producers in Asia, Mexico, South America and Central Europe. Some of those producers are foreign affiliates of the segment’s competitors in North America. The segment had a market share in 2018 of approximately 10.3 percent of all light vehicle replacement tire sales in the U.S. The segment also participates in the U.S. TBR tire market. A portion of the products manufactured by the segment are exported throughout the world.
Success in competing for the sale of replacement tires is dependent upon many factors, the most important of which are price, quality, performance, line coverage, availability through appropriate distribution channels and relationships with dealers and retailers. Other factors include warranty, credit terms and other value-added programs. The segment has built close working relationships through the years with independent dealers. It believes those relationships have enabled it to obtain a competitive advantage in that channel of the market. As a steadily increasing percentage of replacement tires are sold by large regional and national tire retailers, the segment has increased focus on its penetration of those distribution channels, while maintaining its traditionally strong network of independent dealers. The segment is also active in various other sales channels, including digital channels and others in which the Company has been less active in the past.
The segment’s replacement tire business has a broad customer base that includes purchasers of proprietary brand tires that are marketed and distributed by the Company and private label tires which are manufactured by the Company but marketed and distributed by the Company’s customers.
Customers generally place orders on a month-to-month basis and the segment adjusts production and inventory to meet those orders, which results in varying backlogs of orders at different times of the year. Tire sales are subject to a seasonal demand pattern. This usually results in the sales volumes being strongest in the third and fourth quarters and weaker in the first and second quarters.
International Tire Operations Segment
The International Tire Operations segment is the combination of the Europe and Asia operating segments. The European operations include manufacturing operations in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and the Republic of Serbia (“Serbia”). The U.K. entity manufactures and markets passenger car, light truck, motorcycle and racing tires and tire retread material for domestic and global markets. The Serbian entity manufactures passenger car and light truck tires primarily for the European markets and for export to the North American segment. The Asian operations are located in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). Cooper Kunshan Tire manufactures passenger car and light truck tires both for the Chinese domestic market and for export to markets outside of the PRC. On December 1, 2016, the Company acquired 65 percent ownership of China-based GRT, a joint venture manufacturing facility located in the PRC. GRT serves as a global source of TBR tire production for the Company. The segment also had another joint venture in the PRC, PCT, which manufactured and marketed truck and bus radial and bias tires, as well as passenger car and light truck tires for domestic and global markets. The Company sold its ownership interest in this joint venture in November 2014, and the Company began procuring certain TBR and passenger car tires under off-take agreements with PCT through mid-2018, which were subsequently extended and now expire in mid-2020. In December 2017, the Company signed an off-take agreement with Sailun Vietnam, as an additional source of TBR tires. On December 12, 2018, Cooper Tire & Rubber Company Vietnam Holding, LLC ("Cooper Vietnam"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Cooper, and Sailun Vietnam entered into an equity joint venture contract to establish a joint venture in Vietnam which will produce and sell TBR tires in addition to the off-take agreement. The new joint venture is expected to begin producing tires in 2020. The segment sells a majority of its tires in the replacement market, with a growing portion also sold to OEMs. 
On January 17, 2019, Cooper Tire & Rubber Company Europe Ltd. (“Cooper Tire Europe”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, committed to a plan to cease light vehicle tire production at its Melksham, England facility. Light vehicle tire 
--

production is expected to be phased out over a period of approximately 10 months. An estimated 300 roles will be eliminated at the site. Cooper Tire Europe will obtain light vehicle tires to meet customer needs from other production sites within the Company’s global production network. Approximately 400 roles will remain in Melksham to support the functions that continue there, including motorsports and motorcycle tire production, the materials business, Cooper Tire Europe headquarters, sales and marketing, and the Europe Technical Center.
As in the Americas Tire Operations segment, the International Tire Operations segment operates in a highly competitive industry, which includes Bridgestone Corporation, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company and Groupe Michelin. These competitors are substantially larger than the Company and serve OEMs as well as the replacement tire market. The segment also faces competition from low-cost producers.
Raw Materials
The Company’s principal raw materials include natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, chemicals and steel reinforcement components. The Company acquires its raw materials from various sources around the world to assure continuing supplies for its manufacturing operations and to mitigate the risk of potential supply disruptions.
During 2018, the Company experienced increases in the costs of certain of its principal raw materials in comparison to 2017. The pricing volatility of natural rubber and certain other raw materials contributes to the difficulty in accurately predicting and managing these costs.
The Company has a purchasing office in Singapore to acquire natural rubber directly from producers in Southeast Asia. This purchasing operation enables the Company to work directly with producers to continually improve consistency and quality, while reducing the costs of materials, transportation and transactions.
The Company’s contractual relationships with its raw material suppliers are generally based on long-term agreements or purchase order arrangements. For natural rubber, natural gas and certain principal materials, procurement is managed through a combination of buying forward production requirements and utilizing the spot market. For other principal materials, procurement arrangements include supply agreements that may contain formula-based pricing based on commodity indices, multi-year agreements or spot purchases. These arrangements only cover quantities needed to satisfy normal manufacturing demands.
Working Capital
The Company’s working capital consists mainly of inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable. These working capital accounts are closely managed by the Company. Inventory balances are primarily valued at a last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) basis in the U.S. and under the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) basis in the rest of the world. Inventories turn regularly, but balances typically increase during the first half of the year before declining as a result of increased sales in the second half. The Company’s inventory levels are generally kept within a targeted range to meet projected demand. The mix of inventory is critical to inventory turnover and meeting customer demand. Accounts receivable and accounts payable are also affected by this business cycle, typically requiring the Company to have greater working capital needs during the second and third quarters. The Company engages in a rigorous credit analysis of its customers and monitors their financial positions. The Company offers incentives to certain customers to encourage the payment of account balances prior to their scheduled due dates.
At December 31, 2018, the Company held cash and cash equivalents of $356 million.
Research, Development and Product Improvement
The Company directs its research activities toward product development, performance and operating efficiency. The Company conducts extensive testing of current tire lines, as well as new concepts in tire design, construction and materials. During 2018, over 137 million miles of tests were performed on indoor test wheels and in monitored road tests. The Company has a tire and vehicle test track in Texas that assists with the Company’s testing activities. Uniformity equipment is used to physically monitor manufactured tires for high standards of ride quality. The Company continues to design and develop specialized equipment to fit the precise needs of its manufacturing and quality control requirements. 
Patents, Intellectual Property and Trademarks
The Company owns or has licenses to use patents and intellectual property covering various aspects in the design and manufacture of its products and processes and equipment for the manufacture of its products. While the Company believes these assets as a group are of material importance, it does not consider any one asset or group of these assets to be of such importance that the loss or expiration thereof would materially affect its business.
The Company owns and uses tradenames and trademarks worldwide. While the Company believes such tradenames and trademarks as a group are of material importance, the trademarks the Company considers most significant to its business are 
--

those using the words "Cooper," "Mastercraft," "Roadmaster," "Starfire" and “Avon.” The Company believes all of these significant trademarks are valid and will have unlimited duration as long as they are adequately protected and appropriately used. Certain other tradenames and trademarks are being amortized over the next one to two years.
Seasonal Trends
There is year-round demand for passenger car and truck replacement tires, but passenger car replacement tire sales are generally strongest during the third and fourth quarters of the year. Winter tires are sold principally during the months of May through November.
Environmental Matters
The Company recognizes the importance of compliance in environmental matters and has programs in place to comply with local, state, federal and foreign requirements and regulations. The Company has an organizational structure which allows it to supervise environmental activities, planning and programs to ensure compliance. The Company also participates in activities concerning general industry environmental matters, and the Company is committed to achieving a baseline of key environmental sustainability metrics and targets. A number of the Company’s operations are certified to the ISO 14001 standard and the Company has been recognized with several awards for efforts to improve energy efficiency.
The Company’s manufacturing facilities, like those of the industry generally, are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment. In general, the Company has not experienced difficulty in complying with these requirements and believes they have not had a material adverse effect on its financial condition or the results of its operations. The Company expects additional requirements with respect to environmental matters will be imposed in the future. The Company’s 2018 expense and capital expenditures for environmental matters at its facilities were not material, nor is it expected that expenditures in 2019 for such matters will be material.
Global Social Impact
The Company is committed to environmental responsibility and the health and safety of its employees, contractors and the community, as well as the long-term, sustainable health and growth of the Company. The Company's organization structure allows it to supervise and audit, using a combination of internal and external resources, environmental activities, planning and programs to ensure compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety ("EHS") requirements and Company standards. Additionally, the Company has implemented a global EHS management system to predictably and sustainably manage EHS and to hold management accountable for non-compliance. The Company also participates in activities concerning general industry environmental matters, including the Tire Industry Project and the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber.

Foreign Operations
The Company has a manufacturing facility, a technical center, a distribution center and its European headquarters office located in the U.K. The Company has a manufacturing facility, two distribution centers and an office in Serbia. In total, there are seven distribution centers and three sales offices in Europe. The number of foreign operations in Europe will not be impacted by the January 17, 2019 decision to cease light vehicle tire production at its Melksham, England manufacturing facility. The Company has a manufacturing facility and a joint venture manufacturing facility, two distribution centers, a technical center, a sales office and an administrative office in the PRC. The Company also has a purchasing office in Singapore. A joint venture manufacturing facility, in Vietnam, is expected to become operational in 2020 as a result of the joint venture contract signed by Cooper Vietnam and Sailun Vietnam in December 2018. In Latin America, the Company has a joint venture manufacturing facility, an administrative office, three sales offices and a distribution center.
