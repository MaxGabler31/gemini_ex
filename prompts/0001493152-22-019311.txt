Our Product Portfolio
 
Our products are sold directly to distributors and retail customers. Our portfolio of owned and licensed brands and products are organized into the following categories:
 
Karaoke— including our flagship brand Singing Machine, our karaoke line is driven by quality products at affordable price points that we believe deliver great value to our customers. All of our karaoke products are Bluetooth® enabled to allow access to digital music content via our mobile apps available on iOS and Android platforms. We believe our core karaoke line offers best-in-class innovative features that, including but not limited to enables customers to output video to a TV screen, correct singer’s pitch in real-time, stream karaoke content directly to the machine, sing duets, display scrolling lyrics in-time with the song, and play custom karaoke CD+G discs. The Company’s products are sold directly to consumers via its retail channels, ecommerce, its own website, and distributors worldwide. This product category accounted for approximately 82% of our net sales in our fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.
 
Licensed Products— including brands such as Carpool Karaoke. In 2019, we entered into a 3-year license agreement with CBS® for its Carpool Karaoke brand, made popular by James Corden on The Late Show with James Corden. We launched an innovative Carpool Karaoke Microphone that works specifically in the car. This license agreement with CBS® expires on September 30, 2022. We are actively exploring renewing the license agreement and exploring new licensing opportunities. This product category accounted for approximately 3% of our net sales in our fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.
 
Microphones and Accessories— we currently offer a line of traditional microphone accessories that are compatible with our karaoke machines. These microphones feature an assortment of colors, come wired or wireless, and may include new features like party lighting and voice changing effects. We are also seeing growth in portable Bluetooth® microphones which are marketed under our Party Machine brand. This product category accounted for approximately 9% of our net sales in our fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.
 
Singing Machine Kids Youth Electronics— including the brand Singing Machine Kids. Our kids line of products offer fun music entertainment features designed specifically for children. Our kids’ products provide a high-quality introduction to singing and music entertainment for young singers and offer innovative features like voice changing effects, recording, Bluetooth® compatibility, and portability.

Music Subscriptions— in conjunction with our premium partner, Stingray Digital, we offer karaoke music subscription services for the iOS and Android platforms as well as a web-based download store and integrated streaming services for our hardware. We currently offer almost 20,000 licensed karaoke songs in the catalog. This product category accounted for approximately 1% of our net sales in our fiscal year ended March 31, 2022.
 
Product Development and Design
 
Product development is a key element of our strategic growth plan. We strive to deliver many new, exciting consumer products to market every single year to retain our presence as the market-leader in consumer karaoke products. Strategic product development is done in-house from our corporate headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, FL where we identify new potential categories, features, and price points. Products are created in conjunction with contract product designers and inventors in collaboration with our contract manufacturers in China to deliver products that represent tremendous value to our customers. In addition to new products, we always look for ways to improve existing products to hit more affordable price points or improve features based upon market feedback.
Business Segments
 
We operate in one principal industry segment across geographically diverse marketplaces, selling our products globally to large, national retailers as well as independent retailers, on our retailer’s websites, and our own direct to consumer website. In North America, our customers include Amazon, Costco, Sam’s Club, Target and Wal-Mart. Our largest international territories are the U.K. and Australia, where we sell through international distributors, representatives. We also sell to select international retail customers in geographic locations where we do not have a direct sales presence.

Suppliers and Manufacturing 
 
We source our products from a variety of contract manufacturers in southern China. We are not dependent on any one supplier as we use many manufacturers (currently over 5) to make our products. We maintain a Hong Kong office that provides us with factory management, sourcing, quality control, engineering, and product development. We buy finished goods from our suppliers and generally do not source raw materials for manufacturing, however in limited circumstances where we develop proprietary hardware and software, we will secure the proprietary circuits and provide to our contract manufacturers for assembly into the final product. While we are not responsible for sourcing raw materials, we rely on our contract manufacturers’ ability to secure injected plastic, wood cabinets, integrated circuits, display panels, speaker drivers, and other components that are necessary for assembly into our final products.
 
Our goods are produced by our contract manufacturers and are either shipped via ocean vessels to our distribution center in Ontario, California or we utilize a direct import program where our retail customers coordinate to pick up the goods FOB China. The direct import program allows our customers to take advantage of better ocean container rates through bigger volume and allows us to bypass our California warehouse. We maintain a third-party logistics warehouse in Canada where we sell directly to retail customers and independent channels in Canada. Historically, most of our customers pick up goods from our warehouse (freight collect).
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our products are marketed and sold through our direct sales team, working in conjunction with independent sales representatives that provide sales and customer support for our retail customers in North America. Sales are recognized upon transfer of title to our customers and are made utilizing standard credit terms of approximately 60-90 days. Our sales terms indicate that we only accept returns for defective merchandise, however we have accepted overstock returns from our retail partners in the past. Please see risk factor titled “We are subject to the risk that some of our large customers may return karaoke products that they have purchased from us and if this happens, it would reduce our revenues and profitability” under “Risk Factors”.
 
We seek to expand our direct-to-consumer sales, which we believe will increase overall gross margins and also increase brand awareness.
 
Marketing, promotion and consumer engagement are key elements in the youth electronics, toy, and music categories. Historically, a significant percentage of our promotional spending has been structured as co-op promotion incentives with our large retail partners. We continue to focus our marketing efforts on growing brand awareness among our target consumer demographic, optimizing marketing investments, and executing an integrated marketing strategy. We believe an important component of our future growth is based on speaking to the right customer, with the right content, in the right channel, at the right time. We have implemented online marketing, social media, and digital analytics tools, which allow us to better measure the performance of our marketing activities, learn from our consumers, and receive valuable insights into industry and competitor activities.
 
Customer service is a critical component of our marketing strategy. We maintain a U.S.-based internal customer service department within our corporate headquarters that responds to customer inquiries, investigates and resolves issues, and is available to assist customers and consumers during business hours.
 
Competition
 
The youth electronics, toy, and music industry has many participants, none of which has dominant market share, though certain companies may have disproportionate strength in specific product categories. We compete with a number of different companies in a variety of categories, although there is no single company that competes with us across all of our product categories. Our largest direct competitors are Singsation®, Singtrix®, eKids®, Bonaok, Karaoke USA™, and Ion® Audio.
 
The primary method of competition in the industry consists of brand positioning, product innovation, quality, price, and timely distribution. Our competitive strengths include our ability to develop innovative new products, speed to market, our relationships with major retailers, and the quality and pricing of our products.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of word and design mark trademarks and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property. In certain circumstances, we will partner with third parties to develop proprietary products, and, where appropriate, we have license agreements related to the use of third-party innovation in our products. The duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.
Customers
 
Sales to our top five customers together comprised approximately 90% of our net sales in both fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021. In our fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, revenues from three of these customers represented greater than 10% of net sales at a percentage of 37%, 18%, and 17% of total net sales. In our fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, revenues from four of these customers represented greater than 10% of net sales at a percentage of 36%, 20%, 13% and 12% of total net sales.
 
We have no long-term contracts with these customers, and as a result, our success depends heavily on our customers’ willingness to purchase and provide shelf space for our products.

Seasonality
 
We do experience heightened seasonal demand for our products in our second and third quarters of our fiscal year. In our fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 and our fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, approximately 81% and 86%, respectively, of our net sales shipped in our second and third quarters. However, we continually look for products and new categories to reduce our exposure to seasonality variances.
Regulatory Matters
 
Each of our products is designed to comply with all applicable mandatory and voluntary safety standards. In the United States, these safety standards are promulgated by federal, state and independent agencies such as the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, ASTM, the Federal Communications Commission, the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, and various states Attorney Generals and state regulatory agencies. All of our products are independently tested by third party laboratories accepted by the Consumer Product Safety Commission to verify compliance to applicable safety standards. A similar approach is used to design and test products sold internationally.
Insurance
 
We carry product liability insurance that provides us with $10,000,000 coverage with a minimal deductible. We consult with our insurers to ascertain appropriate liability coverage for our product mix. We believe our current coverage is adequate for our existing business and will continue to evaluate our coverage in the future in line with our expanding sales and product breadth.
Human Capital Resources
 
We believe that the development, attraction and retention of employees is an important factor to our Company’s success. We offer our employees a wide range of benefits, including 100% paid health benefits for the employee, generous leave, vacation, and personal paid time-off, 12 paid company holidays a year, and flexible work hours to work-from-home. To support the advancement of our employees, we offer training and development programs encouraging advancement from within. As of the filing of this report, we had 32 employees, 17 of which are located at our corporate office and 15 at our logistics center in Ontario, California. During peak shipping season, (July through December), we rely heavily on temporary labor at our logistics warehouse to handle the increased shipment volume.
Environmental Issues
 
We may be subject to legal and financial obligations under environmental, health and safety laws in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we operate. We are not currently aware of any material environmental liabilities associated with any of our operations.
