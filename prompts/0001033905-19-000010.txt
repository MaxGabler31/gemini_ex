ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We develop, manufacture and sell proprietary biological testing technologies and products with applications throughout the life sciences industries, including diagnostics, pharmaceutical and research. These industries depend on a broad range of tests, called assays, to perform diagnostic testing and conduct life science research. We have established a position in several segments of the life sciences industries by developing and delivering products that satisfy a variety of customer needs in specific market segments, including multiplexing, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, reduction of labor and ability to test for proteins and nucleic acids. These needs are addressed by our proprietary technologies. 
Multiplexing, the foundation of our Company, allows the end user in a laboratory to generate multiple laboratory results from a single sample with a single assay. This is important because our end user customers, which include laboratory professionals performing discovery, research and clinical laboratories performing tests on patients as ordered by physicians and other laboratories, have a fundamental need to perform high quality testing as efficiently as possible. Until the availability of multiplexing technology, the laboratory professional had to perform one assay at a time in a sequential manner, and if additional testing was required on a sample, a second assay would be performed to generate the second result, and so on until all the necessary tests were performed. 
Our xMAP Technology 
Our xMAP technology is an open architecture, multiplexing technology that combines existing biological testing techniques with illumination, advanced digital signal processing, detection and proprietary software. With our technology, discrete assays are performed on the surface of color-coded microspheres. These microspheres are read in a compact analyzer that utilizes lasers or light emitting diodes (LEDs), detectors, charge-coupled device imaging and high-speed digital signal processing to simultaneously identify the assay and measure the individual assay results. The key features of xMAP technology include the following:

• | Multi-analyte/multi-format

xMAP technology has been designed to simultaneously perform up to 500 distinct assays in a single tube or well of a microtiter plate using only a small amount of sample. Moreover, unlike most existing technologies that are dedicated to only one type of assay, xMAP can perform multiple types of assays including enzymatic, genetic and immunologic tests on the same instrumentation platform.

• | Flexibility/scalability

xMAP technology allows flexibility in customizing test panels. Panels can be modified to include new assays in the same tube by adding additional microsphere sets. It is also scalable, meaning that there is no change in the manufacturing process and only minimal changes to the labor required to produce a small or large number of microsphere-based tests.

• | Both protein and nucleic acid applications on a single platform

xMAP technology has an advantage due to its ability to analyze both proteins and nucleic acids. This allows customers to utilize a single platform to evaluate samples across more biological parameters and generate a more complete assessment of these samples. Alternative technologies are typically restricted to either proteins or nucleic acid, requiring customers to use two or more technologies from other vendors to get the same information.

• | High throughput

Our technology can perform up to 500 tests in a single well, permitting up to 96,000 tests to be detected in approximately one hour with only a small amount of sample. Rapid sample analysis permits efficient use for high-throughput applications. 

• | Ease of use

Most xMAP-based assays are simple to perform. A test sample is added to a solution containing microspheres that have been coated with reagents. The solution is then processed through one of our xMAP systems which incorporate proprietary software to automate data acquisition and analysis in real-time.
1


• | Cost-effective

By performing multiple assays at one time, xMAP technology is designed to be cost effective for customers compared to competitive techniques such as ELISA or real-time PCR. By analyzing only those assays in which a customer is interested, xMAP is also more cost effective than most competing microarray technologies. In addition, microsphere-based assays are inexpensive compared to other technologies, such as chip based microarrays.
Two types of microspheres, polystyrene microspheres and polystyrene magnetic microspheres, are both fundamental components of the xMAP technology. We purchase and manufacture microspheres and, in a proprietary process, dye them with varying intensities of proprietary dyes to achieve up to 500 distinct colors. The specific dye proportions permit each color-coded microsphere to be readily identified based on its distinctive fluorescent signature. Our customers create assays by attaching different biochemical reactants to each distinctly colored microsphere set. These unique reactants bind, or capture, specific substances present in the test sample. The microsphere sets can then be combined in test panels as required by the user, with a maximum of 500 tests per panel. Customers can order either standard microspheres or magnetic microspheres.
To perform an assay using xMAP technology on our systems, a researcher attaches biomarker detectors such as antibodies or nucleic acid oligos to one or more sets of color-coded microspheres, which are then mixed with a test sample. This mixture is injected into the xMAP analyzer, such as the Luminex 200 instrument, where the microspheres pass single-file in a fluid stream through two laser beams. The first laser excites the internal dyes that are used to identify the color of the microsphere and the test being performed on the surface of the microsphere. The second laser excites a fluorescent dye captured on the surface of the microspheres that is used to detect the result of the assay taking place. Our proprietary optics, digital signal processors and software record the fluorescent signature of each microsphere and compare the results to the known identity of that color-coded microsphere set. The results are analyzed and displayed in real-time with data stored on the computer database for reference, evaluation and analysis.
Our xMAP technology is currently being used within various segments of the life sciences industries, including the fields of drug discovery and development, and for clinical diagnostics, bio-defense, food safety and biomedical research.
We have a full range of instruments using our xMAP Technology: our LUMINEX® 100/200™ Systems offer 100-plex testing; our FLEXMAP 3D® System is our high-throughput, 500-plex testing system; and our MAGPIX® System provides 50-plex testing at a lower cost using imaging rather than flow cytometry. By using our xMAP technology, the end users are able to be more efficient by generating multiple simultaneous results per sample. We believe that this technology may also offer advantages in other industries, such as in food safety, animal health and bio-defense/bio-threat markets. Using the xMAP products Luminex has available today, up to 500 simultaneous analyte results can be determined from a single sample.
Our Amnis/Guava® Technologies
Due to our recent acquisition of EMD Millipore Corporation’s flow cytometry portfolio, which closed on December 31, 2018, we now have both Amnis® and Guava® technologies.The Amnis Systems are a family of imaging flow cytometry products for cell-based analysis. With the proprietary Amnis charge-coupled device detection and time-delayed integration (CCD-TDI) technology, the CellStream® provides fluorescence and small particle sensitivity in a highly customizable flow cytometer. The FlowSight® and ImageStream® Imaging Flow Cytometers combine the speed and sensitivity of flow cytometry with the functional detail and spatial information of microscopy. The Guava portfolio of products, which are versatile, easy-to-use cytometry systems based on microcapillary fluidics technology, include the Muse® Cell Analyzer, a simple, compact, and affordable system for absolute cell counting, viability, and basic cell health analyses, and the Guava easyCyte™ System, a versatile benchtop platform for additional, multi-dimensional cell health and biological assessments. 
The Acquisition expands Luminex’s existing offering of flow-based detection systems, which is centered around our innovative xMAP® multiplexing technology, with more than 15,000 xMAP systems sold worldwide. The results of operations for the Acquisition will be included in Luminex’s consolidated financial statements beginning January 1, 2019. 
Our Non-Automated Technologies
Our xTAG technology consists of several components, including multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or target identification primers, DNA Tags, xMAP microspheres and data analysis software. xTAG technology permits the development of molecular diagnostic assays for clinical use by hospital and reference laboratories. xTAG technology has also been applied to human genetic assays, pharmacogenetic assays and infectious disease assays.
2

Our MultiCode technology is based upon a unique assay chemistry that is a flexible platform for both real-time PCR and multiplex PCR-based applications. MultiCode-based PCR assays are primarily used for the detection of infectious diseases and genetic-based conditions. We have multiple molecular diagnostic (MDx) assays based on the MultiCode chemistry. MultiCode products are based upon the unique MultiCode bases, isoC and isoG. The synthetic isoC:isoG DNA base pair differs from the naturally occurring base pairs in its hydrogen bonding pattern. As a result, the MultiCode bases, isoC and isoG, can only pair with each other, but can co-exist with naturally occurring nucleotide pairs. This property enables site-specific incorporation of the isobases during amplification. The MultiCode base pair is recognized by naturally occurring enzymes and can be used for the specific placement of reporter molecules and to increase the molecular recognition capabilities of hybridization-based assays. The MultiCode base pair enables solutions to complex molecular challenges that were previously not possible with natural nucleic acid alone.
We have multiple assay development activities ongoing and these activities are focused in the areas of infectious disease, human genetics, and pharmacogenomics. 
Our ARIES® Technology
The ARIES® System is our sample to answer platform for our MultiCode®-RTx technology, including In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) assays. The ARIES® System is a clinical test system which automates and integrates extraction of nucleic acid from a clinical sample, performs real-time PCR, and detects multiple signals generated by target-specific probes. The ARIES® System is used with specific assays to measure multiple analytes indicative of infectious disease. The ARIES® System uses internal barcode scanning and other advanced features to minimize operator errors. Each independent module supports from one to six cassettes, allowing both STAT and batch testing. The ARIES® System can run both IVD and MultiCode® Analyte Specific Reagents (ASRs) simultaneously with a common Universal Assay Protocol. 
Our VERIGENE Technology
Our offering in the molecular diagnostic market segment includes proprietary diagnostic tools that enable rapid and accurate detection of respiratory, gastrointestinal and bloodstream infections.  Our U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared VERIGENE® Gram-Positive Blood Culture (BC-GP) and Gram-Negative Blood Culture (BC-GN) test panels for the early detection of pathogens associated with bloodstream infections are leading products in the high-growth bloodstream infection testing segment. In addition to detecting bacteria, these panels also detect yeast and identify antibiotic resistance markers. In contrast to traditional methodologies, which can take several days, these assays enable physicians to identify pathogens, including any associated resistance markers, and prescribe the most appropriate antibiotic regimen, all within 2.5 hours after identification of a positive blood culture. The ability for clinicians to make earlier, better informed therapeutic decisions results in improved patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs. Our VERIGENE product offering also includes FDA-cleared products for the detection of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections. These consist of a targeted product for the detection of C. difficile, as well as highly multiplexed molecular enteric, blood and respiratory pathogen panels which test for a wide spectrum of microorganisms often associated with these types of infections. With the combination of the ARIES® and VERIGENE platforms, Luminex offers customers automated molecular platforms for both syndromic and targeted molecular diagnostic testing.
The VERIGENE System is an automated multiplex-capable system that rapidly and accurately detects infectious pathogens and drug resistance markers.  The VERIGENE System consists of: (i) VERIGENE Test Cartridges, which are single-use, self-contained test units, and (ii) VERIGENE instrumentation, including the VERIGENE Processor SP, which is a modular bench-top analyzer, that combines automated nucleic acid extraction, purification, amplification (if needed), and hybridization in each module, as well as the VERIGENE Reader, which manages sample information and reads results from processed cartridges. Tests that run on the VERIGENE System are primarily designed to identify infections in the bloodstream, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract.
The VERIGENE System utilizes advanced automation and proprietary chemistry to enable rapid sample to result detection of nucleic acid and protein targets. NanoGrid Technology, a unique gold nanoparticle probe chemistry, is the driving force behind all VERIGENE tests, providing a foundation for the VERIGENE System’s menu of clinically meaningful diagnostics.
3

In addition to our menu of infectious disease tests, we are currently developing a next generation VERIGENE System, VERIGENE II, that we expect will deliver an improved user experience. This next generation system is designed to provide a reduced time to result, an improved user interface and a room temperature cartridge, all in a fully automated sample to result system with an optimized footprint. In addition, customers using this system will have the ability to select both individual and groups of targets on assays using Flex pricing. This approach to target selection allows customers to save money by only paying for the targets they wish to see, which will often align with healthcare standard of care guidelines, when available. If these results do not provide a conclusive diagnosis, additional targets that were tested for but not released can immediately be viewed for an incremental charge.
Our Market Approach
We primarily serve the life sciences industries by marketing products, including our specific testing equipment and assays, to various types of testing laboratories. We have a large base of installed systems that has grown primarily from the following:

Industry Background
The life sciences industries use assays to detect the presence and characteristics of certain biochemicals, proteins or nucleic acids in a sample. Drug discovery, genetic analysis, pharmacogenomics, clinical diagnostics and general biomedical research all use assays. For example, assays can be used to:

• | measure the presence and quantity of substances such as infectious agents, antigens for histocompatibility, hormones, cancer markers and other proteins in a patient’s blood, other body fluid or tissue to assist physicians in diagnosing, treating or monitoring disease conditions;


• | detect genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms or genetic mutations present in inherited diseases;


• | measure the response to a compound or dosage by measuring cellular activity to assist in drug discovery and development; and

5


• | assist physicians in prescribing or dosing the appropriate drug therapy based on the patient’s genetic makeup, a field known as pharmacogenetics.

The life sciences customer can purchase assays in the form of complete off-the-shelf kits, develop them from scratch or utilize a customized service to meet the customer’s specific needs.
The table below briefly describes the key assay technologies in the life sciences industries:

Business Strategy 
Our Company’s current focus is the transition from a technology-based tools company to a market-based diagnostic company and the establishment of Luminex as a market leader in the molecular diagnostic market. To achieve these objectives, we have implemented and are pursuing the following strategies:
6


• | Focus on key markets

We have identified the following key market segments: (i) molecular infectious disease, (ii) genetic or inherited disease, (iii) human leukocyte antigen (HLA) transplant diagnostics, (iv) immunodiagnostics and (v) life sciences research. We will continue to employ a combination of a partnership-driven business model and a product-driven business model focused on selected market segments and assay applications.

• | Develop and deliver market-leading molecular diagnostic platforms and assays

Our research and development and our acquisition activity has expanded the breadth of technology and solutions we offer our customers to meet their needs. We acquired the MultiCode RTx real-time PCR technology for both quantitative and qualitative low-plex real-time PCR assays and the GenturaDx IDbox sample to answer platform, which is compatible with our MultiCode RTx technology, to provide our customers with a complete system for their real-time PCR assays. The GenturaDx IDbox was further developed and launched as the ARIES® System. A key focus currently is the development of additional assays for our ARIES® System. The ARIES® System, when combined with our proprietary real-time PCR chemistry and a new menu of highly automated assays that we are developing, is designed to offer a differentiated, easy to use diagnostic solution. The ARIES® System is designed to help clinical diagnostic laboratories overcome their daily challenges: minimizing healthcare cost increases while maintaining the overall quality of healthcare, the scarcity of highly trained laboratory personnel and limited lab bench space. The ARIES® System offers barcode-based data entry, an efficient workflow, a slim design that occupies minimal bench space, universal assay protocols that enable true walkaway automation and ability to simplify laboratory developed tests (LDTs). 
The VERIGENE System offers automated, cost-effective multiplex capabilities that rapidly and accurately detect infectious pathogens and drug resistance markers, without relying on time-consuming culture methods.  We currently offer assays on the VERIGENE platform in the categories of Bloodstream Infection Tests, Gastrointestinal Infection Tests and a Respiratory Infection Test.  The VERIGENE Bloodstream Infection Tests provide cost-effective bacterial identifications and antibiotic resistance determinations directly from positive blood culture bottles up to 48 hours faster than conventional methods. The BC-GP test provides 15 different targets, and the BC-GN test provides 14 different targets.  VERIGENE enables an earlier shift from empiric to targeted antibiotic treatment and differentiates potential blood culture contaminants. As a result, the VERIGENE System delivers better outcomes, improved patient care, and true antibiotic stewardship, all at a lower cost.  
Testing for gastrointestinal pathogens has traditionally been labor-intensive, unpleasant for technologists to perform, has low sensitivity, and can take as long as five to seven days to produce definitive results.  The VERIGENE C. difficile Test for healthcare-acquired diarrhea with 027 hypervirulent strain differentiation and VERIGENE Enteric Pathogens Test for community-acquired diarrhea with nine bacterial and viral targets require less than five minutes of user hands-on time and deliver comprehensive results directly from a stool sample in less than two hours. As a result, the VERIGENE System provides earlier optimization for patient treatment and improved laboratory and hospital efficiency.
Influenza is highly contagious and affects up to 20% of the U.S. population each year. It is responsible for more than 200,000 hospitalizations, and as many as 49,000 deaths, each year depending on the severity of the season. Influenza can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, and a general worsening of chronic conditions.  Respiratory pathogens are responsible for more than one billion annual cases of the common cold and other related illnesses. They are recognized as a serious contributor to respiratory ailments in children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised and are commonly mistreated with unnecessary antibiotics due to delays in diagnosis. The VERIGENE Respiratory Pathogens Flex (RP Flex) provides viral identification information clinicians need to select appropriate treatment for their patients. VERIGENE RP Flex can limit misuse and overuse of antibiotics, which are ineffective and not indicated for viral infections, and it can provide results within two hours. 

• | Develop next generation products

We have developed a full range of multiplexing instruments and consumables to cover a broad range of customer applications and budgets.  We have developed, and continue to improve, our proprietary chemistries for our multiplex assays in areas such as human genetic testing, personalized medicine testing and infectious disease testing. All of these technology solutions provide our customers with a breadth of innovative solutions to meet their many testing needs.
7

We have continued the development of the VERIGENE II System. We initiated clinical studies on the system and its first assay in 2018 and currently expect to commercially launch the VERIGENE II System in 2019. We are also developing the next generation Guava System, acquired as part of the Acquisition. We currently believe the Guava Next Gen System will commercially launch by the end of 2019. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we launched our sample to answer platform, ARIES® System. We also received FDA clearance for a number of assays that run on the ARIES® System as noted on page 5. We have plans to submit additional assays to regulatory authorities in 2019, including the FDA and foreign equivalents, for market authorizations.
In addition, we are collaborating with industry participants, biomedical research institutions and government entities to develop additional products on our platform. We continuously consider other adjacent markets where our platform and assay offerings would be beneficial. 
We have improved the simplicity and ease of use of our multiplex products through the development of a version of our multiplex PCR technology. This NxTAG chemistry enables customers to experience streamlined workflow without sacrificing throughput. We recognize that the crucial aspect of our current technology that we want to preserve for our larger customers is the ability to process samples from 1 to 96 patients in a single batch. This throughput flexibility and capacity is a crucial aspect for tests like our xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP), in which seasonality and local outbreaks can cause testing volumes to surge unpredictably. We offer the convenience of a one-step workflow with the throughput of a batch-based system. In addition, products using this chemistry are expected to have the convenience of room temperature shipping and storage. Additionally, we continue pursuing projects such as the development of consumables, automation, software and the expansion and enhancement of our multiplexing capabilities to advance our technologies and market acceptance. 
We are working on the development of a next generation bead-based multiplexing instrument.  This new system would provide the opportunity to address both expanding and evolving market needs, plus an opportunity for existing users to upgrade to a refreshed version of bead-based multiplexing. After determining requisite performance criteria, we commenced the development of this new system utilizing third-party resources.  We currently expect to have a commercial launch in 2019.

• | Actively pursuing acquisitions that could accelerate our business strategies

We utilize analytical tools and an evaluation template to assess potential acquisition targets to accelerate our business strategies in the key markets described above. This approach led to several successful acquisitions historically, including GenturaDx, which is the foundation of our ARIES® System, the acquisition of Nanosphere, which is the foundation of the VERIGENE System and our recent acquisition of EMD Millipore Corporation’s flow cytometry portfolio. We actively evaluate opportunities to enhance our capabilities or our access to targeted markets or technologies, or provide us other advantages in executing our business strategies in our key markets.

• | Continue to develop the partnership channel focused in select key markets

As of December 31, 2018, 50 of our 74 strategic partners have developed and commercialized xMAP based assays and are paying royalties to us. We also have strategic partners who distribute Luminex products. During 2018, the 50 strategic partners who have commercialized xMAP based assays accounted for approximately 54% of our total revenue and all of our strategic partners represented approximately 55% of our total revenue. We intend to continue pursuing opportunities to expand market acceptance of xMAP technology through development, marketing and distribution partnerships with leading companies in the life sciences markets. By leveraging our strategic partners’ market positions and utilizing their distribution channels and marketing infrastructure, we believe we can continue to expand our installed instrument base. Furthermore, our partners’ investments in research and development for xMAP applications provide Luminex xMAP customers with more assay options than any one company or Luminex could develop and commercialize individually.
8

We continue to focus our commercialization efforts through our strategic partners covering large sectors of the life science research market, where Luminex believes it has competitive advantages over alternative technologies and approaches. We define strategic partners as those companies in the life sciences markets that develop and distribute assays and tests on xMAP technology or may only distribute our xMAP technology based systems and consumables. With our partners’ support and through our direct commercial efforts in the molecular diagnostics clinical laboratory segment, we have targeted major pharmaceutical companies, large clinical laboratories, research institutions and major medical institutions for our principal marketing efforts. We believe that these customers provide the greatest opportunity for maximizing the use of xMAP based products and that continued adoption by these industry leaders will promote wider market acceptance of our xMAP technology.

With the ImageStream System, fluorescence intensity measurements are acquired as with a conventional flow cytometer; however, the best applications for the ImageStream System take advantage of the system’s imaging abilities to locate and quantify the distribution of signals on in or between cells.
Amnis® Cellstream®. The new CellStream Flow Cytometer delivers high sensitivity and flexibility for cell and particle analysis. This compact system contains patented CCD-TDI technology unique to our Amnis Flow Cytometers and may be configured with up to seven lasers to adapt to a wide range of analytical requirements. With highly sensitive and configurable optics, researchers benefit from multiparameter detection capabilities, while maintaining the flexibility to tailor and expand the system according to their research needs and budget.
Guava easyCyte™ Benchtop Flow Cytometer. The Guava easyCyte line includes compact benchtop flow cytometers models that offer up to 3 lasers and 14 parameters with excellent sensitivity and optional high throughput auto-sampling capabilities. Guava easyCyte systems use patented, microcapillary, laser-based technology capable of detecting mammalian and microbial cells, particles, and beads. A sample of fluorescently labeled cells is aspirated into a uniquely proportioned microcapillary flow cell providing direct absolute counting of cells without reference beads. Forward and side scatter characteristics are detected by photodiode, and fluorophores excited by the violet, blue, or red laser emit signals that are spectrally filtered to resolve up to 10 fluorophores simultaneously. The instruments are supported by a line of 40 reagent FlowCellect® Kits and elegant InCyte™ acquisition and analysis software.
Muse®Cell Analyzer. The Muse Cell Analyzer is a simple, compact, easy-to-use benchtop device that uses patent-pending, miniaturized fluorescent detection and microcapillary technology to deliver accurate, precise and quantitative cell analysis. It is versatile enough to analyze both suspension and adherent cells 2–60 μm in diameter and includes a user-friendly touchscreen interface, intuitive software and optimized “Mix-and-Read”assays.
Consumables
MicroPlex® Microspheres. Our Luminex 100/200, FLEXMAP 3D and MAGPIX Systems use polystyrene microspheres that are approximately 5.6 microns in diameter. We dye the microspheres in sets with varying intensities of a red and a near infrared dye to achieve up to 100 distinct color sets. Each microsphere can be coupled with proteins, nucleic acids or other molecules to enable biological assays.
MagPlex® Microspheres. These microspheres feature super-paramagnetic properties that make them ideal for running automated xMAP®-based assays. We dye the microspheres in sets with varying intensities of a red and a near infrared dye to achieve up to 500 distinct color sets. These microspheres can be moved or held in place by a magnetic field. Many automated systems utilize magnetic properties to automate the performance of the assay. Automating sample testing using MagPlex microspheres on a robotic sample preparation system decreases hands-on technician time, improves precision and streamlines workflow.
xTAG® Microspheres. These dyed microspheres are linked to a set of 100 proprietary nucleic acid capture sequences providing a “universal array” for DNA and RNA work. They are designed for conducting genotyping and other nucleic acid-based experiments in the life sciences, pharmaceutical and clinical diagnostic markets. When used in conjunction with our Luminex systems, xTAG microspheres are designed to simplify the molecular assay development process and increase assay flexibility. xTAG microspheres may be used by customers to develop LDT assays and are used in Luminex’s xTAG assay kits. 
SeroMAP™ Microspheres. These 100 distinct sets of microspheres are designed for specific protein-based serological applications. Certain Luminex partners use this product for enhanced sensitivity in serum-based assays.
Calibration and Control Microspheres. Calibration microspheres are microspheres of known fluorescent light intensities used to calibrate the settings for the classification and reporter channel for the Luminex systems. Control microspheres are microspheres that are used to verify the calibration and optical integrity for both the classification and reporter channels for the various systems.

In addition to the commercially available assays, we are an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of custom reagents and instrumentation for certain of our customers.
Sales and Marketing 
Our molecular diagnostic sales and marketing strategy is to expand the installed base and utilization of xMAP, xTAG, NxTAG®, ARIES®, and VERIGENE product lines. Our LTG is focused on generating recurring revenues from the sale of Luminex developed assays, microspheres and other consumables, as well as from royalties on kits and testing services developed or performed by partners. We have two key elements to our sales and marketing strategy: (i) marketing internally developed assays directly to end users and (ii) building and maintaining long-term relationships with our strategic partners. Our strategic partners include immune/clinical diagnostic, protein diagnostic, pharmaceutical and life sciences companies that develop applications and/or provide testing services using our xMAP technology platforms. Some partners also distribute xMAP Systems to their customers.
We sell the xTAG, NxTAG, MultiCode, ARIES® and VERIGENE product lines primarily through a direct sales channel. Building a direct relationship with customers is a critical component of our sales and marketing strategy to launch new, innovative products such as NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP), ARIES® Systems and VERIGENE Systems. In addition, we market and sell our clinical diagnostics products to Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) and Integrated Healthcare Delivery Networks (IDNs). These efforts support and enable our selling efforts to individual laboratories, for example by contracting with GPOs to provide standardized pricing and terms for member hospitals.
Outside of our direct molecular diagnostic business, we continue to work with strategic partners as the primary distribution channel for our xMAP Systems, and we will continue to pursue new partnerships focusing on partners with market presence in the key partner segments described above. Some of our strategic partners develop application-specific kits for use on our xMAP Systems that they, in turn, sell to their customers, thereby generating royalties for us. Certain strategic partners also perform testing services for third parties using our xMAP products, which also result in royalty revenue. We also contract with distributors to purchase and resell xMAP Systems and consumables in geographic or application-specific areas not covered by strategic partners.
We update our LTG listing regularly to reflect partner consolidations resulting from mergers and acquisitions, commercial sales inactivity, as well as termination or expiration of existing non-performing partner agreements. As of December 31, 2018, we had 74 strategic partners, compared to 73 strategic partners as of December 31, 2017. During 2018, all 50 strategic partners with commercialized products utilizing xMAP Technology submitted royalties. As of December 31, 2018, all 50 of these strategic partners with commercialized products remain, of which 31 companies principally serve the clinical diagnostics market and 19 companies principally serve the life science research market. Revenues from these commercialized, royalty-submitting, strategic partners constituted 58% of our revenues for 2018. We also believe our strategic partners provide us with complementary capabilities in product development, regulatory expertise and sales and marketing. By leveraging our strategic partners’ assay development capabilities, customer relationships and distribution channels, we believe that we can continue to achieve measurable market penetration and product adoption. Our current partners are in various stages of development and commercialization of products that incorporate our technology.
We also serve as an OEM provider for certain strategic partners that choose to sell components of the xMAP product line as an embedded system under their own branding and marketing efforts.

Our flow cytometry sales and marketing strategy is to become a global leader in flow cytometry, competing in all markets with disruptive and differentiated solutions by expanding our position in the research markets, building our diagnostic capabilities and increasing content generation. We expect that the growth of our flow cytometry business will be driven by our pipeline of new product launches and expanding our positions in the pharma, academic, diagnostics, and industrial markets, which should grow our recurring revenue in service, research and clinical reagents, and clinical trial solutions. In turn, we expect these accomplishments will drive geographic expansion in both established and developing markets.
We sell the Amnis and Guava Flow Cytometry Systems through a direct sales channel in developed markets in North America, EMEIA and APAC, and through distribution partners in emerging markets in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The near-term goals of this business line are to strengthen the flow cytometry direct sales channel through integration into the Luminex sales function and expand our distribution networks in emerging markets. Our flow cytometry business has built healthy relationships with its customer base and has a reputation for quality customer support through its sales team and field application scientists, as well as technical service and instrument repair teams. We anticipate continuing to leverage these strengths to expand its installed base of instruments and concomitant recurring sales of reagents, software licenses, and services. 
Customers
In each of the last three years, two customers or partners each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. LabCorp accounted for 15%, 20% and 20% of our total revenues and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. accounted for 14%, 15% and 13% of our total revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. No other customer or partner accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in 2018, 2017 or 2016; however, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. accounted for 6%, 6% and 7% of our total revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The loss of any of these customers or partners (including LabCorp’s decision to move to an alternative vendor for women’s health products in 2018 discussed further on page 30) could have a material adverse effect or our business, financial condition and results of operations.
International Operations
We currently ship products to a number of customers outside the United States, primarily including customers in Canada, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. For the annual periods ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, foreign shipments to customers totaled $54.1 million, $49.7 million and $47.9 million, respectively, representing 17%, 16% and 18%, respectively, of our total revenues for such periods. We have foreign subsidiaries in Canada, the Netherlands, the People’s Republic of China, Japan, and Hong Kong, which increase our international support, service and marketing capabilities. Sales to territories outside of the U.S. are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We believe that our activities in some countries outside the U.S. involve greater risk than our domestic business due to foreign economic conditions, exchange rate fluctuations, local commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Technical Operations
Our Technical Operations Group provides technical assistance to our customers, our distributors, our strategic partners and their customers. Most of our technical operations personnel have experience as biologists, biochemists or electrical engineers and have extensive experience in academic, industrial and commercial settings. Cross training is a major focus, as is empowering group members to solve problems outside of their primary assignment.
Remote Support
Our technical support department assists users primarily through a toll-free hotline, internet interface and e-mail communications. We deliver “24/7” remote technical support with our staff based at our Austin, Northbrook and Toronto locations and from our European, Chinese and Japanese subsidiaries to better serve our customer base. Personnel assist our distributors, strategic partners and customers in inquiry and complaint management related to Luminex products, system implementation and development of their assays. A comprehensive software and database system is utilized to track customer interactions, follow trends and measure utilization. The information is categorized and presented to management for regular review.
Training
We offer comprehensive programs in basic system training, advanced assay development, instrument field service and technical support functions. A portion of our training material is web-based and available online. Customers have the option to receive training on-site at their location or locally, with our staff based at our Austin, Northbrook, European, Chinese or Japanese offices.
13

Field Support
We currently have field service and field application personnel based across North America, Europe, China and Japan in areas of our more significant system concentration. In addition, several of our distributors and strategic partners provide their own field service and field application support. As we continue to expand our installed base, we believe a strong, reliable, efficient field support organization is crucial to maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction.
Research and Development 
Our research and development groups work to develop next generation systems, chemistries, assays and software to provide new, innovative products to our customers. Our research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, was $47.2 million, $45.7 million and $48.7 million, respectively.
Our current research and development projects include:

• | New platform and technology development

We are working on the development of the next generation, sample to answer, molecular diagnostic, automated VERIGENE II System. This involves the final design and development of the instrument, consumables and software as well as the development of a menu of assays for that system. We initiated clinical studies on the system and its first assay in 2018.

• | New sample to answer menu development

We have a pipeline of new targeted and syndromic assays for use on the ARIES®, VERIGENE and the next generation VERIGENE II Systems. These automated assays are primarily in the area of infectious disease testing.

• | Updated xMAP system

Our updated xMAP system, SENSIPLEXTM, is nearing testing with partners and we expect will be ready for commercial launch by early 2020. Among other activities, our partners will need to validate the backwards capability of previously developed kits and plan their launches of new kits that will be able to take advantage of the increased sensitivity of this next generation xMAP System.

• | Guava Next Gen

Our recently acquired flow cytometry research and development group has been working on a next generation Guava instrument that will provide researchers with simplified benchtop flow cytometry combined with an easy to use software interface. This new instrument will allow researchers to perform basic to advanced analysis with a consistent and reliable platform on the benchtop. These researchers will be in academia, pharma, government and biotechnology segments, and will be conducting research in areas such as immunology, cancer, bacteria, and others. This product will be a research use only product but is expected to launch worldwide by the end of 2019.
Manufacturing 
We have approximately 124,000 square feet of leased manufacturing space, including space located at our principal executive offices in Austin, Texas (74,000 square feet), in Madison, Wisconsin (12,000 square feet), in Toronto, Canada (11,700 square feet), and in Northbrook, Illinois (26,300 square feet). In addition, in connection with the closing of the acquisition of EMD Millipore Corporation’s flow cytometry portfolio on December 31, 2018, we gained approximately 10,000 square feet of leased manufacturing space in Seattle, Washington.

We initially certified our Quality Management System (QMS) to the ISO 9001:2000 standard and in 2010 updated our certification to ISO 9001:2008. ISO is an internationally recognized standard for quality management systems. Subsequent audits by the registrar have been and will continue to be carried out at regular intervals to ensure we are maintaining our system in compliance with ISO standards. Recertification is required every three years and we have been successfully recertified since obtaining our original ISO certification. Also, we have our QMS certified to the ISO 13485:2012 Quality Management Standard and the Canadian Medical Devices Regulation (CMDR). These standards include a special set of requirements specifically related to the supply of medical devices and related services. Additionally, we manufacture to current FDA “Good Manufacturing Practice” requirements and our QMS is implemented in accordance with FDA Quality System Regulations (21 CFR 820).
Supply Chain
We have historically purchased many of the components and raw materials used in our products from numerous suppliers worldwide. For reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability and cost-effectiveness, certain components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are available only from one supplier. We have worked closely with our suppliers to develop contingency plans to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability, and in some cases, we have established long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. Due to the high standards and FDA requirements applicable to the manufacturing of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials or components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture our products on a timely and cost-competitive basis may be compromised, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Instruments
Component suppliers and contract manufacturers provide certain components and component assemblies of our xMAP and ARIES® Systems. The remaining assembly and manufacturing of our systems are performed at our facilities in Austin, Texas and Northbrook, Illinois. The quality control and quality assurance protocols are all performed at our facilities. Parts and component assemblies that comprise our technology systems are obtained from a number of sources. We have identified alternate sources of supply for several of our strategic parts and component assemblies. Additionally, we have entered into supply agreements with most of our suppliers of strategic parts and component subassemblies to help ensure component availability and flexible purchasing terms with respect to the purchase of such components. As of December 31, 2018, a total of 15,979 Luminex multiplexing analyzers have been shipped since 1999, some of which may be retired or otherwise not in use.
Microspheres
We procure our undyed, standard MicroPlex® microspheres and manufacture our magnetic MagPlex® carboxylated polystyrene microspheres. We synthesize our dyes and manufacture our dyed microspheres using a proprietary method in our Austin, Texas manufacturing facility in large lots. We dye the microspheres with varying intensities of red and near infrared dyes to produce our distinctly colored microsphere sets. We currently purchase the standard polystyrene microspheres from one supplier, in accordance with a supply agreement. We believe this agreement will help ensure microsphere availability and flexible purchasing terms with respect to the purchase of such microspheres. While we believe the microspheres will continue to be available from our supplier in quantities sufficient to meet our production needs, we believe our in-house manufacturing capabilities along with other potential suppliers would provide sufficient microspheres for us if given adequate lead-time to manufacture the microspheres to our specifications.
Assays and Reagents
Component suppliers and contract manufacturers produce certain components of our developed reagents. The remaining assembly and manufacturing of our on-market kits are performed at one of our facilities in Austin, Texas, Toronto, Canada, Madison, Wisconsin, Northbrook, Illinois, or Seattle, Washington. The quality control and quality assurance protocols are all performed at our facilities. Reagents, consumables and other raw material that comprise our kits are obtained from a number of sources.
In addition to developed assay kits, increasing regulatory requirements coupled with rising demand for new clinical applications are driving demand for laboratory developed tests. Our proprietary technologies and platforms offer a unique combination of flexibility and throughput, as our systems’ open architecture, software and standard protocols allow our customers the ability to use our proprietary reagents to validate and verify a new test, while being able to utilize the same system to handle increasing volumes once the assay is commercialized.
15

Competition
We design our xMAP Systems and consumables for use by customers across the various segments of the life sciences, pharmaceutical and clinical diagnostic industries. Our xTAG, NxTAG, MultiCode, ARIES® and VERIGENE products are developed specifically for the molecular diagnostic segment. Our competition includes companies marketing conventional testing products based on established technologies such as ELISA, real-time PCR, mass spectrometry, gene sequencing, biochips, arrays and flow-based technologies, as well as next generation sequencing and companies developing their own advanced testing technologies.
The pharmaceutical industry is a large market for the genomic, protein and high-throughput screening applications supported by xMAP Technology. In each application area, Luminex faces a different set of competitors. Genomic and protein testing can be performed by products available from Affymetrix, Inc. (a Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. brand), Life Technologies Corporation (a Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. brand), Becton, Dickinson and Company, Illumina, Inc., Qiagen N.V., Meso Scale Discovery (a division of Meso Scale Diagnostics LLC), Quanterix Corporation, PerkinElmer, Inc., Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., and others.

Some of these companies have technologies that can run a variety of established assays. In addition, certain of these companies offer integrated systems and laboratory automation that are designed to meet the need for improved work efficiencies in the clinical laboratory.
Competition within the academic biomedical research market is highly fragmented. There are hundreds of suppliers to this market including, among others, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, a part of GE Healthcare, Life Technologies Corporation (a Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. brand) and Becton, Dickinson and Company.
Intellectual Property
To establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements.  We have filed for registration or obtained registration for trademarks used with our products and key technologies.
We have implemented a strategy designed to optimize our intellectual property rights. For core intellectual property, we are pursuing patent coverage in the United States and those foreign countries that correspond to the majority of our current and anticipated customer base. We currently own 728 issued patents worldwide directed to various aspects and applications of our products and technology, including 243 issued patents in the United States. Other countries in which we have issued patents directed to various aspects and applications of our products and technology include, among others, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Netherlands, Canada, Hong Kong and China. Our patent portfolio also includes 160 pending patent applications in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. We believe our patents and pending patent applications provide, or will provide, protection for systems and technologies that allow real-time multiplexed analytical techniques for the detection and quantification of many analytes from a single sample. We also hold patents covering the fluorescently dyed, magnetically responsive microspheres and patents covering digital over-sampling to measure the area of a fluorescence pulse instead of “peak detection,” giving increased sensitivity with no lost events. In addition, multiple granted patents and pending applications describe aspects of Multicode technology, xTAG technology, nanoparticle technology, the ARIES® and VERIGENE Systems, NxTAG technology, imaging flow cytometry technology and capillary flow cytometry technology.
The source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret and/or as a copyrighted work. Aspects of this software also are covered by an issued patent.
We also rely on trade secret protection of our intellectual property. We attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with strategic partners, third parties, employees and consultants. Our employees and third-party consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in inventions and original works of expression and any corresponding patents and copyrights arising from their work for us. See Item 1A, Risk Factors - “The property rights we rely upon to protect the technologies underlying our products may not be adequate to maintain market exclusivity. Inadequate intellectual property protection could enable third parties to exploit our technologies or use very similar technologies and could reduce our ability to distinguish our products in the market.”

Government Regulation
Our products are generally considered medical devices and are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and similar agencies outside the United States. To varying degrees, each of these agencies require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our medical devices. Our business is also affected by the United States and foreign patient privacy laws, cost containment initiatives and environmental health and safety laws and regulations. The primary laws and regulations that are particularly relevant to our business are described below.
Food and Drug Administration
In general, the products that we manufacture are considered to be medical devices and are subject to regulation in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. We also manufacture versions of the Luminex instruments for use with diagnostic assay kits that are available through our strategic partners. For FDA purposes, the Luminex systems are considered components of our partners’ kit products. Kits manufactured by our strategic partners used in conjunction with our technology, may be subject to clearance or approval requirements and other FDA regulations.
The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes on the basis of the intended use of the device, the risk associated with the use of the device for that indication, as determined by the FDA, and on the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices, which have the lowest level of risk associated with them, are subject to general controls. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards. Class III devices, which have the highest level of risk associated with them, are subject to general controls and premarket approval. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from a requirement that the manufacturer submit a premarket notification, or 510(k), and receive clearance from the FDA which is otherwise a premarketing requirement for a Class II device. Class III devices may not be commercialized until a premarket approval application, or PMA, is submitted to and approved by the FDA.
510(k) Clearance Pathway
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a sponsor must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent, or SE, to a device legally marketed in the U.S. for which a PMA was not required. The FDA is supposed to make a SE determination within 90 days of FDA’s receipt of the 510(k), but it often takes longer if the FDA requests additional information. Most 510(k)s do not require supporting data from clinical trials, but the FDA may request such data. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or possibly a pre-market approval. 
De Novo Classification
Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure.
This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (“FDASIA”), a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
17

Premarket Approval Pathway
A PMA must be submitted if a new device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is generally more complex, costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After a PMA is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin an in‑depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the accepted application, although, review of the application generally can take between one and three years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendations are important to the FDA’s overall decision making process. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with its quality system regulations, or QSRs. New premarket approval applications or premarket approval application supplements are also required for product modifications that affect the safety and efficacy of the device.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are usually required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for a 510(k). In the U.S., if the device is determined to present a “significant risk,” the manufacturer may not begin a clinical trial until it submits an investigational device exemption application, or IDE, and obtains approval of the IDE from the FDA. These clinical trials are also subject to the review, approval and oversight of an institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical trial site. The clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations and good clinical practices. A clinical trial may be suspended by FDA, the sponsor or an IRB at its institution at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the trial. Even if a clinical trial is completed, the results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a device to the satisfaction of the FDA, or may be equivocal or otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval of a device.
FDA Enforcement
After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include among other things:

• | establishment registration and device listing;


• | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent


• | design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;


• | labeling regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses and other requirements related to promotional activities;


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA if their device

may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or if their device malfunctioned and the
device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a
death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;

• | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA field

corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a
violation of the FD&C Act that may present a risk to health; and

• | post market surveillance regulations, which apply to certain Class II or III devices when necessary to

protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
18

To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre‑scheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions, including but not limited to, warning letters; fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; recall or seizure of the device; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new devices; withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals; and civil or criminal prosecution.
Research Use Only Products
Our products are currently intended for research use only, or RUO, applications, although our customers may use our products to develop their own products that are subject to regulation by the FDA. Although most products intended for RUO are not currently subject to clearance or approval by the FDA, RUO products fall under the FDA’s jurisdiction if they are used for clinical rather than research purposes. Consequently, our products are labeled “For Research Use Only.
On November 25, 2013, the FDA issued Final Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff on “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only,” or, the RUO/IUO Guidance. The purpose of an FDA guidance document is to provide the FDA’s current thinking on when IVD products are properly labeled for RUO or for IUO, but as with all FDA guidance documents, this guidance does not establish legally enforceable responsibilities and should be viewed as recommendations unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The RUO/IUO Guidance explains that the FDA will review the totality of the circumstances when evaluating whether equipment and testing components are properly labeled as RUO. Merely including a labeling statement that a product is intended for research use only will not necessarily exempt the device from the FDA’s 510(k) clearance, premarket approval, or other requirements, if the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicate that the manufacturer intends its product to be used for clinical diagnostic use. These circumstances may include written or verbal marketing claims or links to articles regarding a product’s performance in clinical applications, a manufacturer’s provision of technical support for clinical validation or clinical applications, or solicitation of business from clinical laboratories, all of which could be considered evidence of intended uses that conflict with RUO labeling. Consequently, our products are labeled “For Research Use Only” and meet the intent of the RUO/IUO Guidance.
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA)
Laboratories that purchase certain of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), CLIA is a set of federal regulatory standards that apply to all clinical laboratory testing performed on humans in the United States (with the exception of clinical trials and basic research). A clinical laboratory is defined by CLIA as any facility that performs laboratory testing on specimens obtained from humans for the purpose of providing information for health assessment and for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease.”). CLIA requires laboratories to meet specified standards in areas such as personnel qualifications, administration, participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. such laboratories to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure that testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. CLIA certification also is a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal health care programs, as well as many private insurers, for laboratory testing services.
19

As a condition of CLIA certification, laboratories are subject to survey and inspection every other year, in addition to being subject to additional random inspections. The biennial survey is conducted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), a CMS agent (typically a state agency), or, a CMS‑approved accreditation organization. High complexity, CLIA-certified laboratories frequently develop testing procedures to provide diagnostic results to customers. These tests have been traditionally offered by nearly all complex laboratories for the last few decades as Laboratory Developed Tests, or LDTs, which are subject to CMS oversight through its enforcement of CLIA. The FDA also has claimed that it has regulatory authority over LDTs, but has not exercised enforcement with respect to most LDTs offered by high complexity laboratories, and not sought to require these laboratories to comply with FDA regulations regarding medical devices. During 2010, the FDA publicly announced that it has decided to exercise regulatory authority over these LDTs, and that it plans to issue guidance to the industry regarding its regulatory approach. At that time, the FDA indicated that it would use a risk-based approach to regulation and would direct more resources to tests with wider distribution and with the highest risk of injury, but that it will be sensitive to the need to not adversely impact patient care or innovation. In September 2014, the FDA announced its framework and timetable for implementing this guidance. On November 18, 2016, the FDA announced it would not release final guidance at this time and instead would continue to work with stakeholders, the new administration and Congress to determine the right approach. On January 3, 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper outlining a possible risk-based approach for FDA and CMS oversight of LDTs. Later in 2017, the FDA indicated that Congress should enact legislation to address improved oversight of diagnostics, including LTDs, rather than the FDA addressing the issue through administrative proposals. We cannot predict the ultimate timing or form of any such guidance or regulation or their potential impact. If adopted, such a regulatory approach by the FDA may lead to an increased regulatory burden, including additional costs and delays in introducing new tests. While the ultimate impact of the FDA’s approach is unknown, it may be extensive and may result in significant change.
Radiological Health Regulations
Certain of our instruments use lasers to detect assay results. Therefore, we are required to ensure that these products comply with FDA regulations pertaining to the performance of laser products. The Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act, administered by the FDA, imposes performance standards and record keeping, reporting, product testing and product labeling requirements for devices that emit radiation. These regulations are intended to ensure the safety of laser products by establishing standards to prevent exposure to excessive levels of laser radiation. There can be no assurance that the FDA will agree with our interpretation and implementation of these regulations.
Foreign Jurisdictions 
Medical device laws and regulations are also in effect in many countries outside of the United States ranging from comprehensive pre-approval requirements for medical products, to simpler requests for product data or certification. The number and scope of these requirements is increasing. There can be no assurance that we, and our strategic partners, will be able to obtain any approvals that may be required to market xMAP or other technology products outside the United States. In addition, we may incur significant initial and/or ongoing costs in obtaining or maintaining our foreign regulatory approvals. Further, the export by us of products that have not yet been cleared for domestic commercial distribution is subject to FDA and other export requirements and/or restrictions.
We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, or administrative or other penalties, and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future government contracts and programs.
We produce CE marked products, which are subject to a number of different European Union (EU) Directives, including, but not limited to, the In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Directive (98/79/EC) (IVDD). CE marking of our products is currently by self-declaration, not issued by a third party, based on the intended uses of our products. A product that is not CE marked is automatically considered to be non-compliant. The law is enforced through market surveillance by appointed national enforcement agencies. Imported products are checked for compliance at customs offices.
No in vitro device or accessory may be placed on the market or put into service unless it satisfies the essential requirements set forth in the IVDD. Devices considered to meet the essential requirements must bear the CE marking of conformity, placed by the manufacturer, when introduced on the market. A manufacturer placing devices on the market in its name must notify its national competent authorities.
There can be no assurance that the EU member states will agree with our interpretation and implementation of these regulations as it pertains to classification of our products. The failure by us or our strategic partners to comply with the IVDD could have a material adverse effect on our business.
20

The State Food and Drug Administration, P.R. China (SFDA), is the government regulation authority in charge of safety management of drug, food, health food and cosmetics for the People’s Republic of China. The SFDA issues certificates that are required for registration and approval to import our products into China. Certificates are also subject to periodic recertification requirements.  We have received certificates for the “Luminex System,” which combines the Luminex 100 and Luminex 200 into one product, and for our MAGPIX System.
Failure by us, or our strategic partners, to comply with applicable current federal, state and foreign medical product laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal, state and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical devices and components of such devices are continually subject to future changes. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes might have on our business, but any such change could have a material impact.
WEEE
The European Community Council Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) outlines the responsibility for the disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment. Compliance with WEEE is placed with the manufacturers of such equipment. Those manufacturers are required to establish an infrastructure for collecting WEEE, in such a way that users of electrical and electronic equipment from private households should have the ability of returning WEEE at least free of charge.  All Luminex-manufactured equipment is in compliance with this directive. Since August 13, 2005, we have been in compliance with the requirements regarding the labeling and disposal of our products containing electronic devices in each of the EU member states where our regulated products are distributed.
RoHS
RoHS stands for “The Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment” and implements EU Directive 2002/95, which bans the placing on the EU market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing more than agreed levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyl and polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants.
The Directive directly affects producers who manufacture or assemble electrical or electronic equipment in the EU, importers of electrical or electronic equipment from outside the EU and companies that re-brand electric producers as their own. The Directive applies to electrical and electronic equipment falling under the categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 set out in Annex IA of the WEEE Directive (2002/96/EC).  Equipment categories 8 and 9 defined in the WEEE Directive are currently outside the scope of the RoHS Directive. Luminex IVD equipment is classified as category 8 (Medical Devices) in Annex IA of the WEEE Directive, which is not covered within the scope of the RoHS Directive. Luminex research equipment is classified as category 9 (Monitoring and Control Instruments) in Annex IA of the WEEE Directive, which is not covered within the scope of the RoHS Directive.
21

Environmental
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment. In the course of our business, we are involved in the handling, storage and disposal of certain chemicals and biohazards. The laws and regulations applicable to our operations include provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. Some of these environmental laws and regulations impose “strict liability,” rendering a party liable without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party. Such environmental laws and regulations may expose us to liability for environmental contamination, including remediation costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of the conduct of, or conditions caused by, us or others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. Although it is our policy to use generally accepted operating and disposal practices in accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on, under or from properties owned, leased or operated by us or on, under or from other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties may be subject to investigation, remediation and monitoring requirements under federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties or other liabilities. We do not believe that we have been required to expend material amounts in connection with our efforts to comply with environmental requirements or that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. Because the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations may frequently change and new environmental laws and regulations may be adopted, we are unable to predict the cost of compliance with such requirements in the future, or the effect of such laws on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. Moreover, the modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also negatively impact our strategic partners, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us and other similarly situated component companies.
Other Government Regulations
Our operations in the United States are subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and state and federal marketing compliance laws. These laws may impact our operations directly or indirectly through our customers and may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. We are also subject to statutes in foreign jurisdictions that prohibit commercial bribery and certain activities with customers or potential customers. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include the following foreign laws, federal laws and their counterparts at the state level in addition to various implementing regulations:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and state anti-kickback prohibitions;


• | the federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, and state equivalents;


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and implementing privacy, security and breach notification regulations;


• | the Civil Monetary Penalties Law and related exclusion provisions;


• | the federal False Claims Act and state equivalents;


• | the U. K. Bribery Act of 2010;


• | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which applies to our international activities; and


• | the Physician Payment Sunshine Act.

Other
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Affordable Care Act), provides for a medical device excise tax of 2.3% of the sale price on non-exempt medical devices. The Internal Revenue Service implemented this tax on manufacturers, producers and importers in 2013, but the tax was subject to a moratorium beginning in 2016 which Congress has effectively extended through December 31, 2019. The medical device tax has not had, nor do we expect it to have, a material impact on our operations.
22

The Affordable Care Act resulted in extensive changes across the healthcare system, affecting coverage, delivery and reimbursement of services. However, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act. The law has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges, and the presidential administration and certain members of Congress have expressed their intent to repeal or make significant changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation or its interpretation. Effective January 2019, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the individual mandate to maintain health insurance coverage. Because the penalty associated with the individual mandate was eliminated, a federal court in Texas ruled in December 2018 that the entire Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional, however, the law remains in place pending appeal. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act, uncertainty regarding its repeal, the ultimate outcome and impact of court challenges, significant changes to the law or other health reform efforts, such as single-payor proposals, will adversely affect our customers and strategic partners, which could cause them to reduce or delay the purchase of our systems or to demand reduced fees.
Employees
As of February 25, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, we had a total of 1,141 and 988 employees and contract employees, as compared with 896 as of December 31, 2017. The year over year increase is primarily the result of the Acquisition, which was completed on December 31, 2018. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have not experienced any work stoppage. We believe that relations with our employees are good.
Seasonality
Worldwide sales, including U.S. sales, do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, sales of our Respiratory Viral products have demonstrated seasonal fluctuations consistent with the onset and decline of influenza-like illnesses.
Financial information relating to our business for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 can be found in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
