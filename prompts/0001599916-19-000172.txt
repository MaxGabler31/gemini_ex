Industry Overview
 
The mobile application industry was essentially created when the Apple iPhone was introduced in 2007 and has since grown to an industry that is projected to generate around 189 billion U.S. dollars in revenues via app stores and in-app advertising by 2020. The mobile application industry has experienced unprecedented growth because of the widespread popularity of smartphones and other mobile devices that have transformed electronic gaming, internet retailing and social networking. Apple and Google have made highly profitable relationships with app developers, who have developed a tremendous range of mobile applications of countless types that are available on a number of marketplaces where apps are sold. Additionally, their smaller, but not insubstantial, competitors such as Blackberry RIM, Facebook and Amazon have carved out niches in the market for themselves. The future for this industry looks brighter than ever and shows no indication of slowing down in the near future.
 
Since the creation of the first iPhone, where users could experience the convenience and functionality of these pocket-sized devices, these mobile applications are becoming increasingly common in our daily life. According to Mobilewalla.com, a website dedicated to cataloging and rating apps, the one millionth app was made available to users in December, 2011. It took only four years for one million apps to be created, and this unprecedented growth has grown even stronger and more impressive as time goes on. While many of these apps are duplications of existing apps, or alternatively very similar apps with minor cosmetic differences and variations (e.g. an app created for the iPhone and the iPad would be counted twice) this has nevertheless been an overwhelming display of interest in such a new industry. Every week there are as many as 15,000 apps released currently.
 
Smartphone usage grows globally every day and it is widely accepted that there will be more and more apps developed in order to keep up with this ever increasing marketplace. “In a 2011 study conducted jointly by Google and Ipsos MediaCT Germany, data was obtained via random telephone interviews from amongst the general populations of the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. The highest reported smartphone ownership was found in the United Kingdom (45% of those interviewed) and the United States (38% of those interviewed). Even more telling is the 50% increase in ownership that occurred in the United Kingdom between the first phase of the research conducted in January and February of 2011 and the latter phase in September and October of that year (The Mobile Movement, 2011). There is clearly a shift in usage from computers to mobile devices.”
 
Smartphones outsold personal computers in 2010 for the first time and this caused many tech analysts to shift their attention to these handheld devices. During the fourth quarter of 2010 saw 100.9 smartphones shipped worldwide, and for comparison during the fourth quarter of 2009 only 53.9 million units had been shipped. The number almost doubled in as little as one year! “According to Flurry, a company that collects mobile-software data and provides consulting services to software developers, in 2011, smartphone and tablet shipments exceeded the shipments of desktop and notebook computers combined. Software developers are increasingly realizing that in the near future smartphones could replace many core functions of personal computers, such as e-mailing, instant messaging, web browsing, and even gaming (Smartphone Mobile Applications To Overtake Standard Websites in Near Future, 2012). Further, in comparing publically available data pertaining to Internet usage with their own client data concerning mobile app usage, Flurry concluded that users are spending more time on mobile apps than on the Internet (Newark-French, 2011).”
 
“Evidence also suggests that these devices are becoming more and more important in people’s lives. In another study conducted by Google in partnership with Ipsos OTX MediaCT, 5,013 adults in the United States who identified themselves as using a smartphone to access the Internet were interviewed in the last quarter of 2010. Eighty-nine percent of those interviewed reported using their smartphones throughout the day and 68% reported having used an app in the previous week. Seventy-nine percent of respondents reported using their smartphones to help with shopping, and 22% reported using apps on their smartphones to make purchases (The Mobile Movement, 2011).”
 
Even the United States government has taken note of the growing rise in mobile application usage and the advantages that could be gained through creating their own government backed applications to be made available to the public. President Obama ordered, in May 2013, that all major federal agencies make at least two public services available on mobile phones. There has been hope that this initiative will prompt the government and mobile app industry developers to facilitate the creation of applications to take full advantage of government data.
 
“Smartphones contain many of the same components as personal computers. Every smartphone has a processor, random access memory stick(s), USB ports, display adapters, and internal storage devices. Users may even customize and upgrade their devices to suit their individual needs. For example, a user who wishes to use the smartphone for gaming can purchase a device with a multi-core processor and additional storage to hold large games. Most smartphones are also equipped with a touchscreen obviating the need for a physical key board. USB peripherals such as audio headphones and data transfer cables are also available for smartphones (Coustan & Strickland, n.d.).”
 
“The core software found in a smartphone is called the operating system. The operating system contains all the drivers necessary to carry out instructions between the software and hardware of the device. The operating system can be visualized as a software stack consisting of several layers. First, the kernel manages the drivers that manipulate a smartphone's hardware, such as its built-in camera or USB ports. Middleware contains software libraries which link to mobile applications. The application execution environment contains all the application programming interfaces (APIs) for developers to program new mobile applications for the operating system. Finally, the application suite contains core applications which are packaged with the operating system by default. These applications include phone call software, text messaging, menu screens, calendars, and more. A mobile app is software that a user can install on a smartphone to perform a particular task. For example, Android has a GPS app which allows the user to obtain travel directions in real time, or even track the locations of family members from anywhere in the country (Coustan & Strickland, n.d.). “
 
The information provided above, along with the general consensus that the mobile application industry has a very bright and successful future, points to the inevitable conclusion that companies will be created to fill this growing demand and experience tremendous success if they are successful. There have been no indications that the industry is going to slow down, and everything points to a continued demand for high quality mobile applications in the future. This of course is in the opinion of the Company.

Business Information
 
Road Marshall, Inc. is a company with the intent to become one of the, if not the primary, leading publicly traded iOS and Android application development and promotion companies in the industry. Our proprietary application is called Road Marshall. Road Marshall is an application which will be invaluable to its users in the event of car trouble and should revolutionize the way tow truck companies are found within the United States, and eventually around the world.
 
Please see the below pictures of our application Road Marshall. All images can also be seen on our website at: http://www.roadmarshall.com/
 

We believe that one of the most appealing aspects of Road Marshall is the fact that it is user friendly. When a user opens the application they will press the services icon and within moments, assuming the user has a connection to the internet, Road Marshall will identify, on a map, the location of the user and show nearby towing services in the area.
 
The list of nearby towing services will also display the range of prices a user can expect. In the event that a user is experiencing car trouble this will simplify the process of finding assistance in a trying and stressful time. No one wants to experience car trouble and be stuck on the road, but the reality is it happens and Road Marshall will be there to ease the process of finding assistance. At Road Marshall we believe that no one should be left with minimal options when experiencing a breakdown.
 
On the screen which shows nearby towing companies and trucks the user can click on each company and read reviews written by other users of Road Marshall. This is a key feature to the application, and we will allow all of our users to rate and describe their experiences with companies so that, hopefully, if a company is providing poor quality of service or charging exorbitant fees the user will know prior to calling them for assistance.
 
When the ideal towing service is identified the user can directly call the towing service and schedule a tow. Another important aspect is that when the user calls the towing service the location of the application user will be sent directly to the truck driver. This should enable a truck driver to exactly find the application user with no time consuming search process whereby the tow truck driver needs to find the stranded driver. This should serve to significantly decrease the amount of time a user is stranded waiting for assistance.
 
The tow truck driver then has the ability to provide the user with an ETA for when the driver will arrive. Instead of just waiting and hoping the tow truck driver will show up in a timely manner the user will know exactly how long it will take for the driver to arrive, give or take a few minutes for traffic perhaps, and will be able to plan accordingly and with minimal stress.
 
Another aspect of Road Marshall, aside from our assistance with towing services, is our feature which allows a user to locate a fast food restaurant in 49 states (Alaska being the exception). We aim to help drivers not only when they are in a time of crisis, but also when they are simply looking to pick up some food on a long drive and don’t want to spend a large amount of time determining what options are nearby. The application will ascertain the user’s position and show fast food restaurants nearby so that the user can choose from a list of options and navigate directly to their restaurant of choice.
 
The Company plans to market Road Marshall through a combination of social media, online advertising, and print media such as magazines. Despite the fact that our marketing efforts remain in the planning stages we have allocated a definitive marketing budget of $10,000. We have not yet initiated any marketing plan and are awaiting further means to finance our operations.
 
It is worth noting that we expect our application Road Marshall will be free to download and use on iOS, but will not be available on the Android store temporarily. The Company intends to monetize the mobile application through third party advertisements during the 2020 fiscal year. These advertisements could include, but not strictly be limited to, their products, services, and or other mobile applications that are not in direct competition to our own (such as application games for example). At this point in time there are no agreements in place with any specific advertisers, and our plan to monetize our application through advertisements remains in the planning stages.
 
The Company will only begin monetizing the application through advertisements when the application has gained a larger user base. We believe that when a sufficient user base has been achieved then the addition of unobtrusive advertisements will not materially impact the number of users who utilize Road Marshall. There is also the possibility that Road Marshall may insert “in app” purchases whereby a user can purchase upgraded services or products within the app. However, this is speculative and is only mentioned as a possibility down the line if we are not generating sufficient revenue from the use of advertisements alone. At present, no definitive plans are in place for any “in app” purchases.
 
For the year ended September 30, 2017 the Company generated its first instance of revenues in the amount of $40,000. The $40,000 in revenue was generated from technical services provided to an unrelated party for the development of a mobile application. At this time the Company is actively looking to market its own mobile application, “Road Marshall” in the United States. Furthermore the Company intends to seek new clients to provide technical services in relation to the advancement of their own mobile applications for iOS and Android devices, but has taken no meaningful steps to do so.
 
For the year ended September 30, 2018 and for the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company has generated no revenue and has not taken any action(s) to progress the Company’s business plan. The Company’s business plan remains the same. Additional outside financing is required to fully implement our business plan. Based on the preceding two fiscal years, there can be no assurances that the Company will take any material steps to further its business plan during the coming fiscal year.
 
Engchoon Peh has informally agreed to advance funds “on a need be basis” to allow us to pay for filing fees, and professional fees that we may incur. At present, with our application fully developed, we do not believe we will require substantial additional financing from Mr. Peh, however without additional funding we will be unable to grow and market our business in the manner we intend to. Our business operations cannot progress further without additional financing, and Mr. Peh may not be willing to provide it to us. In the event that we cannot raise the money we seek, we may be forced to halt or suspend our proposed marketing and business activities and our application and third party application development services may not have the capability to begin generating profits which could result in a loss of all or part of your investment in our company.
 
As of the date of this report, our mobile application is currently unavailable on the app store. The app has been temporarily removed while we update to the latest Apple iOS, and it is our intention for the application to be returned to the app store after the first quarter of 2020.
