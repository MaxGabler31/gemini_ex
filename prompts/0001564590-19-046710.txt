 Faneuil 
 Background 
 Faneuil is a Delaware corporation with headquarters in Hampton, VA. We acquired Faneuil from Harland Clarke Holdings Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc., for aggregate consideration of $53.0 million. 
 Faneuil is a nationally recognized leader in technology-enabled in-person and automated service delivery, particularly in regulated, highly complex environments. 
 Acquisition of Realtime Digital Innovations, LLC
 In July 2019, Faneuil acquired Realtime Digital Innovations, LLC (the “RDI Acquisition”), an exclusive partner of Faneuil for the past 18 months providing workflow automation and business intelligence services. The RDI Acquisition is expected to provide Faneuil with a sustainable competitive advantage in the business process outsourcing space by allowing it to, among other things, (i) automate process workflows and business intelligence, (ii) generate labor efficiencies for existing programs, (iii) expand potential new client target entry points, (iv) improve overall customer experience, and (v) increase margin profiles through shorter sales cycles and software license sales.  Faneuil plans to consolidate the RDI business under Faneuil’s corporate umbrella.
Acquisition of Customer Management Outsourcing Business
 In May 2017 (the “CMO Business Purchase Date”), Faneuil acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities associated with the customer management outsourcing business (“CMO Business”) of Vertex Business Services LLC.  
 Faneuil purchased the CMO Business to expand into the utilities market by providing direct customer care call center operations, back-office processes, including billing, collections and business analytics, and installation and cloud-based customer care support for the utilities industry.

Services 
 Faneuil provides business processing solutions for an extensive client portfolio that includes both commercial and government entities across several verticals, including transportation, utilities, healthcare, consumer goods, and government/municipal services.  Utilizing advanced applications and a dedicated team of service professionals, Faneuil delivers broad outsourcing support, ranging from customer contact centers, fulfillment operations, and information technology services, to manual and electronic toll collection and violation processing, with the goal of building its clients’ brands by providing exemplary customer service. 
 Faneuil’s core competencies include: 
  
• | High-volume, multi-channel customer contact centers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Customer relationship management;
--+----------------------------------


• | Billing, payment, and claims processing;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | Data entry;

• | Document management;
--+---------------------


• | Operational expertise;
--+-----------------------


• | Workforce and support analytics;
--+---------------------------------


• | Quality assurance;
--+-------------------


• | Back office and fulfillment operations;
--+----------------------------------------


• | System support and maintenance; and
--+------------------------------------


• | Staffing services.
--+-------------------

 Faneuil employees who have contact with customers undergo intensive training and development, followed by structured monitoring and assessments before they are certified to process customer contacts. Faneuil’s customer contact employees provide service delivery through multiple communication channels, including telephone, fax, email, web chat and face-to-face interaction. Additionally, Faneuil provides multi-lingual representatives to accommodate the communication needs of non-English-speaking customers, as well as the hearing-impaired. 
 Employees 
 Faneuil had 5,499 employees as of September 30, 2019 (up from 5,042 employees as of September 30, 2018), all of whom are located in the U.S. No employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements. Faneuil considers its employee relations good. 
Customers 
 Faneuil’s client portfolio includes both government and commercial entities nationwide, including several toll authorities, state agencies, municipalities, publicly-owned utilities, health benefit exchanges, one government agency that operates the major airports serving the Washington, D.C. area, and several other public and private entities. 
 The percentages of Faneuil net revenue derived from its significant customers for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: 
 
 
 | Year Ended September 30, | 
-----------+--------------------------+-----
 | 2019 | | | 2018
Customer A | | 13.8 | % | | 15.4 | %
Customer B | | 10.8 | | | 11.2 | 
Customer C | | 10.3 | | | 10.7 | 

 
Many Faneuil customers are government agencies subject to contractual budgetary ceilings. State and local funding for these agencies is approved by the respective state legislature(s) each year. Depending on budgetary constraints, the contract values may be subject to change based upon ongoing legislative approval.

Competition
 Primary competitors to Faneuil are other large providers of toll services, such as Conduent, AEComm, and TransCore, Inc., as well as contact center operators such as Maximus and Automated Health Services. In many cases, Faneuil is smaller and has less financial and personnel resources than its competitors. If Faneuil cannot compete effectively to win new business and retain existing clients, its operating results will be negatively affected. To remain competitive, Faneuil must continuously implement new technologies and expand its portfolio of outsourced services and may have to make occasional strategic adjustments to its pricing for its services.
Properties 
 Faneuil leases all its properties in various locations throughout the United States for customer contact centers, walk-in retail, and administration. Corporate headquarters are located in Hampton, VA.  Faneuil’s leased facilities comprise an aggregate of approximately 400,000 square feet with leases that expire at various dates through April 2029
.  Faneuil believes that its existing leased facilities are adequate for current requirements.  However, Faneuil intends to expand call center capacity by adding new facilities in certain tax beneficial and economically favorable locations to meet its growing business needs.  
Backlog 
 Faneuil backlog represents executed contracts for future services.  Most contracts are long-term and obligate Faneuil to provide services over multiple years.  Faneuil backlog may not represent firm commitments as some contracts, especially with government entities, allow for cancellation under certain instances.  Faneuil adjusts backlog to reflect contract cancellations, deferrals, and revisions known at the reporting date.  However, Faneuil could experience additional contract modifications or cancellations, which may increase or decrease backlog.  
 
The following table reflects the amount of Faneuil backlog by the fiscal year we expect to recognize revenue: 
 
 
 | As of September 30, | 
-----------------------------------+---------------------+------
(in millions) | 2019 | | 2018 | 
Within one year | $ | 210.0 | | $ | 106.6
Between one year and two years | | 133.5 | | | 86.5 
Between two years and three years | | 62.3 | | | 27.6 
Between three years and four years | | 29.2 | | | 12.9 
Thereafter | | 58.6 | | | 1.3 
 | $ | 493.6 | | $ | 234.9

 
The increase in Faneuil backlog at September 30, 2019 compared to September 30, 2018 was primarily driven by new healthcare customer contract awards and the Metro ExpressLanes Customer Service Center Operations contract by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“LA Metro”), awarded in February 2019, to provide the management and day-to-day customer service operations for its ExpressLanes program.
 
For further information regarding Faneuil backlog, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business Generally and our Common Stock - We may not receive the full amounts estimated under the contracts in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated. This makes backlog an uncertain indicator of future operating results.”
 Seasonality 
 Faneuil experiences seasonality within its various lines of business. For example, during the end of the calendar year through the end of the first calendar quarter, Faneuil generally experiences higher revenue attributable to its healthcare customers as the customer contact centers increase operations during the open enrollment periods of the healthcare exchanges. Faneuil revenue from its healthcare customers generally decreases during the remaining portion of the year after the open enrollment period. Seasonality is less pronounced with Faneuil customers in the transportation industry, though there is typically some volume increase during the summer months. 
 3


Governmental Regulation 
 Faneuil’s business is subject to many legal and regulatory requirements in the United States, covering such matters as data privacy, consumer protection, healthcare requirements, labor relations, taxation, internal and disclosure control obligations, governmental affairs and immigration. For example, Faneuil is subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding the protection of consumer information commonly referred to as “non-public personal information,” including the collection of patient data through Faneuil’s contact center services and medical device tracking services, which is subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, commonly known as HIPAA, which protects the privacy of patient data. These laws, regulations, and agreements require Faneuil to develop and implement policies to protect non-public personal information and to disclose these policies to consumers before a customer relationship is established and periodically thereafter. These laws, regulations, and agreements limit the ability to use or disclose non-public personal information for purposes other than the purposes originally intended. Many of these regulations, including those related to data privacy, frequently change and sometimes conflict with existing regulations amongst the various jurisdictions in which Faneuil provides services. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in liability for damages, fines, criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and restrictions on Faneuil’s operations.  Failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to Faneuil’s reputation in the marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on Faneuil’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, because a substantial portion of Faneuil operating costs consists of labor costs, changes in governmental regulations relating to wages, healthcare and healthcare reform and other benefits or employment taxes could have a material adverse effect on Faneuil’s business, results of operations or financial condition. 
Management 
 Faneuil is led by ALJ board member Anna Van Buren, who has served as President and Chief Executive Officer since 2009 and previously served in executive roles at Faneuil since 2004. For additional information regarding Ms. Van Buren, see “Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.” 
Carpets N’ More

 Carpets is one of the largest floor covering retailers in Las Vegas, Nevada, and a provider of multiple products for the commercial, retail and home builder markets, including flooring, countertops, cabinets, window coverings, and garage/closet organizers. In addition to a stone and solid surface fabrication facility, Carpets has two retail locations in the Las Vegas area.

Commercial customers of Carpets include general contractors, real estate investment firms/funds, and other commercial entities such as casinos and other companies looking to improve their office space. Retail customers of Carpets include the general public interested in making home improvements. 
 4


Carpets bids directly with home builders on residential developments and is awarded flooring, countertops and surrounds, and/or cabinet contracts. These contracts involve installing the base level products in each of the residential homes within the awarded development and, when requested, providing upgraded materials and services to the base level products. Carpets also bids on commercial work and is awarded contracts generally on a fixed price basis. These projects generally involve high-rise condos, office buildings, tenant improvements, and off-strip casinos. Carpets also engages in marketing activities, including Internet search engine optimization, banner advertising, car wraps, affiliate websites, radio and television advertising, and referrals targeted toward retail customers. 
 A small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of Carpets net revenue.  The percentages of Carpets net revenue derived from its significant customers for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: 
 
 
 | Year Ended September 30, | 
-----------+--------------------------+-----
 | 2019 | | | 2018
Customer A | | 29.4 | % | | 21.3 | %
Customer B | | 27.3 | | | 27.7 | 
Customer C | | 21.1 | | | 22.7 | 

Suppliers
 Carpets has historically purchased materials from a small number of suppliers primarily to control the quality of the product and to capitalize on volume discounts.  If these suppliers were unable to provide materials on a timely basis, Carpets management believes alternative suppliers could provide the required materials with minimal disruption to the business.  Historically, Carpets has never experienced any significant delay or shortage in the supply of materials. 
 The percentages of Carpets inventory purchases from its significant suppliers for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: 
 
 
 | Year Ended September 30, | 
-----------+--------------------------+-----
 | 2019 | | | 2018 | 
Supplier A | | 20.1 | % | | | 20.8 | %
Supplier B | | 17.7 | | | ** | 
Supplier C | | 10.2 | | | | 14.0 | 
Supplier D | ** | | | | 11.8 | 

 
** Less than 10% of Carpets inventory purchases. 
 Backlog
 
Carpets backlog represents open purchase orders.  As of September 30, 2019, Carpets total backlog, which is expected to be fully realized within the next 12 months, was $11.0 million compared to $12.5 million as of September 30, 2018.  The decrease in Carpets backlog at September 30, 2019, compared to September 30, 2018, was the result of a strategic decision to only accept jobs that yield a targeted profit margin.
 
For further information regarding Carpets backlog, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business Generally and our Common Stock - We may not receive the full amounts estimated under the contracts in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated. This makes backlog an uncertain indicator of future operating results.”
Competition 
 Primary competitors to Carpets include other flooring, countertop and surround, and cabinet providers in the Las Vegas area, such as Interior Specialist Inc. and Classic Flooring, as well as large box stores such as Lowe’s, Home Depot, and RC Willey. Carpets believes that its competitive advantages include a comprehensive and high-end quality solution for home builders for flooring, surrounds, and cabinets, which provides them with a single point of accountability. Carpets also competes with discounted flooring companies such as Cloud Carpet and Carpets Galore.

Seasonality 
 Carpets generally experiences seasonality within the home building business as the number of houses sold during the winter months is typically lower than during other times of the year. Conversely, the number of houses sold and delivered during the remaining portion of the year increases in comparison. 
Employees 
 Carpets had 386 employees, including part-time installers, as of September 30, 2019 (up from 361 employees at September 30, 2018), all of whom are located in the U.S.  No employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements. Carpets considers its employee relations good. 
Properties 
 Carpets leases its corporate office, two retail locations, solid surface fabrication facility, and flooring and cabinet warehouses, which are all located in or around Las Vegas, NV.  Leased facilities total approximately 95,000 square feet with leases that expire at various dates through March 2022. Carpets believes its leased facilities will be adequate for at least the next 12 months.

Phoenix Color Corp. 
 Background 
 Phoenix is a Delaware corporation headquartered in Hagerstown, Maryland.  We acquired Phoenix from Visant Corporation for aggregate consideration of $88.3 million. 
 Phoenix is a premier full-service, full-color printer with over 40 years of superior printing experience. Drawing on a broad spectrum of materials and decorative technologies, Phoenix produces memorable, value-added components, heavily illustrated books, and specialty commercial products. Book publishers generally design book components to enhance the sales appeal of their books. The production of book components requires specialized equipment, materials, and finishes and often demands high-quality, intricate work. As a result, many leading publishers rely on specialty printers such as Phoenix to supply high-quality book components. This same philosophy applies to labels, packaging, and specialty commercial products, where Phoenix customers require the knowledge and expertise of a printer that can enhance their products for sale into the commercial marketplace. Phoenix has been servicing the publishing industry within the United States since 1979 and has formed lasting relationships with many of the biggest names in book publishing. 
 As a domestic manufacturer, Phoenix offers extensive, in-house digital pre-press capabilities and its technologically advanced UV printing platform supports an array of printing and finishing options. Phoenix innovative special effects include foil stamping, UV embellishments, and laminations, as well as its trademarked products LithoFoil®, MetalTone™, Look of Leather™, and VibraColor™. 
 Acquisition of Printing Components Business
 On October 2, 2017, Phoenix acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from LSC Communications, Inc. (“LSC”) and Moore-Langen Printing Company, Inc. related to LSC’s printing and manufacturing services division in Terre Haute, Indiana (“Printing Components Business”).  Total purchase price was $10.0 million.    
 The Printing Components Business leverages existing capabilities and core competencies of Phoenix, strengthens its position in the education markets, and expands its revenue into new markets.
 Acquisition of Color Optics 
 In July 2016, Phoenix acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from AKI, Inc. (“AKI”) in respect of AKI’s Color Optics division (“Color Optics”) for an adjusted purchase price of $6.6 million.

Color Optics is a leading printing and packaging solutions business servicing the beauty, fragrance, cosmetic, and consumer-packaged goods markets.  The purchase of Color Optics complements Phoenix product offerings and has allowed Phoenix to expand and diversify its product offerings by leveraging its existing core competencies.
 
Products and Services 
 Books and Components 
 Phoenix offers several products for books and components, which represents approximately 90% of Phoenix net revenue. 
 Phoenix is a leader in providing distinctive cover components and high-quality, heavily illustrated and multi-colored books for all markets. With its technologically advanced pre-press and press operations as well as an array of finishing applications and innovative special effects, Phoenix is committed to producing memorable, value-added products. 
Labels and Packaging 
 In recent years, Phoenix has expanded into the label and packaging markets to leverage its unique printing and finishing capabilities as well as its trademarked special effects and extensive offerings of finishes and coatings. In 2014, Phoenix acquired the Brady Palmer Company, establishing its presence in the cut and stack label market.  With the subsequent purchase of Color Optics, Phoenix strengthened its presence in the label and packaging markets. 
Employees 
 Phoenix had 433 employees as of September 30, 2019 (down from 444 employees as of September 30, 2018), all of whom are located in the U.S.  Phoenix considers its employee relations good. 
Customers 
 Phoenix sells to many of the leading publishing companies.  A small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of Phoenix net revenue.  The percentages of Phoenix net revenue derived from its significant customers for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: 

 | Year Ended September 30, | 
-----------+--------------------------+-----
 | 2019 | | | 2018 | 
Customer A | | 20.8 | % | | | 19.3 | %
Customer B | | 19.4 | | | | 17.4 | 
Customer C | | 13.2 | | | | 11.4 | 
Customer D | | 10.0 | | | ** | 

 
** Less than 10% of Phoenix net revenue.
 Suppliers
 Phoenix has historically purchased raw materials from a small number of suppliers primarily to control the quality of the product and to capitalize on volume discounts.  If these suppliers were unable to provide materials on a timely basis, Phoenix management believes alternative suppliers could provide the required materials with minimal disruption to the business.  Historically, Phoenix has never experienced any significant delay or shortage in the supply of materials.

Backlog
 
Phoenix backlog represents executed master service agreements (“MSA”) that contain minimum volume commitments over multiple years for future product deliveries. Phoenix includes only the estimated minimum commitments in the MSA as backlog. As Phoenix executed MSAs mostly provide for minimum volume commitments rather than minimum aggregate dollar spend, the actual revenue from such agreements may differ from our backlog estimates as to the total order volume and the timing of such volume. Phoenix adjusts backlog to reflect estimated order volumes delivered by its customers based on historical experience known at the reporting date; however, future variations in order volumes by Phoenix customers may increase or decrease backlog and future revenue.
 The following table reflects the amount of Phoenix backlog by the fiscal year we expect to recognize revenue: 
 
 
 | As of September 30, | 
-----------------------------------+---------------------+------
(in millions) | 2019 | | 2018 | 
Within one year | $ | 68.1 | | $ | 62.8 
Between one year and two years | | 51.5 | | | 49.3 
Between two years and three years | | 37.8 | | | 12.6 
Between three years and four years | | 18.2 | | | 10.0 
Thereafter | | — | | | 2.5 
 | $ | 175.6 | | $ | 137.2

 
The increase in Phoenix backlog at September 30, 2019 compared to September 30, 2018 was primarily driven by the three-year extension of a contract with an existing customer.  
 
For further information regarding Phoenix backlog, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business Generally and our Common Stock - We may not receive the full amounts estimated under the contracts in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated. This makes backlog an uncertain indicator of future operating results.”
 Seasonality 
 There is seasonality to the Phoenix business. Education book component sales (school and college) traditionally peak in the first and second quarters of the calendar year. Other book components sales traditionally peak in the third quarter of the calendar year. Book sales also traditionally peak in the third quarter of the calendar year. The fourth quarter of the calendar year traditionally has been the weakest quarter. These seasonal factors are not significant. 
Competition 
 The printing industry in general and the printing and manufacturing of books, in particular, is extremely competitive. Over the past several years, there has been significant consolidation in the publishing industry, such that fewer publishers control a greater share of the market. Although there are still many small, independent publishers, they do not wield the leverage held by major publishing houses. Additionally, the printing industry has experienced a reduction in demand for trade books due to the impact of the e-book market and a reduction in textbooks due to lower state government funding, alternative product formats and digital distribution of content. 
 Primary competitors in the printing and manufacturing of books and book components include, but are not limited to, LSC, Coral Graphics, Quad Graphics, and Worzalla. There is no reliable industry data available to determine Phoenix’s market share and position versus that of its competitors. With respect to book components, a portion of the products is produced by the book manufacturers and a portion by component printers. The dollar value of book components manufactured by the book manufacturers or by other component printers is unknown. Phoenix and Coral Graphics are the two primary trade book component manufacturers used by major publishers in the U.S. market. Most high-quality, heavily-illustrated and multi-colored books sold in the U.S. are produced outside of the U.S. Phoenix competes with Worzalla and several domestic book manufacturers for that portion that is produced domestically.

Properties 
 Phoenix owns its principal properties for corporate offices and production located in Hagerstown, MD, which totals approximately 276,000 square feet. Additionally, Phoenix owns two buildings totaling approximately 45,000 square feet in Terre Haute, IN, which were acquired as part of the Printing Components Business.  As part of the purchase of Color Optics, Phoenix acquired a lease of a print facility with approximately 84,000 square feet in Rockaway, NJ.  During the year ended September 30, 2018, Phoenix relocated equipment and printing from its Rockaway facility to its Hagerstown facility.  Relocation efforts were completed in November 2018.  In April 2019, Phoenix entered a sublease agreement for the entire Rockaway facility.  The lease and sublease of the Rockaway facility both expire in May 2020.  Phoenix believes its facilities will be adequate for at least the next 12 months.
Management 
 Phoenix is led by Marc Reisch, who currently serves as its Chairman and previously served as its Chief Executive Officer from 2008 to 2015. Mr. Reisch served as a director on ALJ’s Board of Directors from August 2015 until October 2019.  For additional information regarding Mr. Reisch, see “Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.”
