We are a leading lease-to-own provider with operations in the United States, Puerto Rico and Mexico. We provide a critical service for a large portion of underserved consumers by providing them with access to, and the opportunity to obtain ownership of, high-quality, durable products via small payments over time under a flexible lease-purchase agreement with no long-term debt obligation. Through our Rent-A-Center Business, we provide a fully integrated customer experience through our e-commerce platform and brick and mortar presence. Our Acima business offers lease-to-own solutions through retailers in stores and online enabling such retailers to grow sales by expanding their customer base utilizing our differentiated offering. We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1986, and our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “RCII.”
Our principal executive offices are located at 5501 Headquarters Drive, Plano, Texas 75024. Our telephone number is (972) 801-1100 and our company website is www.rentacenter.com. We do not intend for information contained on our website to be part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Lease Purchase Transaction
The lease purchase transaction is a flexible alternative that provides freedom for consumers who wish to obtain use and enjoyment of brand name merchandise with no long-term obligation and without having to pay the full price up front. Generally, our customer has the right, but is not obligated, to acquire title to the merchandise either through an early purchase option or through payment of all lease renewals that would be required to obtain ownership. 
The unit economics of the lease purchase transaction vary depending on the length of time customers take to obtain ownership of the product or whether the customer chooses to return the product without obtaining ownership. If a customer elects an early purchase option within a designated period of time following the initial lease, such as 90 or 120 days, a customer generally pays the retail price of the product plus a premium to the cost. Full term lease-to-own transactions involve the customer leasing our merchandise through a lease structured with multiple lease renewal terms and ultimately obtaining ownership of the merchandise at the conclusion of the final lease renewal term. A customer may also elect to obtain ownership anytime after the initial lease period, but prior to the full term of all lease renewals. Due to the longer lease period of full term lease contracts, along with the other benefits that are part of the lease-to-own transaction, obtaining ownership through payment of all lease renewals involve a higher total cost compared to the cost of the general retail price of the product if it was purchased upfront. Customers primarily take ownership of the merchandise through early purchase options, where the customer elects to make a lump-sum payment at a discounted purchase price prior to the final lease renewal. In the Rent-A-Center Business, the product is often rented more than one time before a customer ultimately obtains ownership. 
There are differences in the unit economics between our Rent-A-Center Business and Acima segments, as we purchase our merchandise at wholesale prices for our Rent-A-Center Business segment and at retail prices for our Acima segment. Historically, operating margin for our Acima segment has benefited from the lower overhead cost associated with the virtual options employed at many third party locations. 
Key features of the lease purchase transaction include:
No long term obligation. A customer may terminate a lease purchase agreement at any time without penalty. Once the product is returned to us, the customer has no obligation for remaining payments other than any outstanding balances to the date of return.
Convenient payment options. Our customers make payments on a weekly, semi-monthly or monthly basis in our stores, at our retail partner locations, online or by telephone. We accept cash, credit or debit cards and payment via certain electronic platforms (such as PayPal and Venmo). Approximately 78% and 94% of our rental purchase agreements are on weekly terms in our Rent-A-Center Business and our Mexico segments, respectively. Payments are generally made on a biweekly or monthly basis in our Acima segment. 
Flexible options to obtain ownership. Ownership of the merchandise generally transfers to the customer if the customer continuously renews the lease purchase agreement for a required period of between seven and 30 months, depending upon the product type, or exercises a specified early purchase option.
Reinstatement. If a customer is temporarily unable to make payments on a piece of rental merchandise and returns the merchandise, that customer generally may later re-rent the same piece of merchandise (or, if unavailable, a substitute of comparable quality, age and condition) on the terms that existed at the time the merchandise was returned, and pick up payments where they left off without losing credit for what they previously paid.
No formal credit needed. Generally, no established credit score or credit history is required. In the Rent-A-Center Business segment, we use a proprietary decision engine to verify customer information as part of our approval process for entering into a lease purchase agreement. In our Acima segment, which provides on-site or virtual lease-to-own options through third-party retailers and through the Acima ecosystem, customers complete the application process through a variety of resources, including online digital waterfall technology, retail partner electronic portals, online e-commerce websites, and the Acima mobile application. A robust proprietary automated decision engine process is used to confirm certain customer information for approval of the lease purchase agreement.
Brand name merchandise. In our store locations and through our retail partnerships, we offer merchandise from a large number of well-known brands such as Ashley and Lane home furnishings; LG, Samsung, and Sony home electronics; Frigidaire, Whirlpool, Amana, and Maytag appliances; HP, Acer, Asus, and Samsung computers and/or tablets; and Samsung smartphones.
Delivery and set-up. We generally offer same-day or next-day delivery and installation of our merchandise at no additional cost to the customer in our Rent-A-Center lease-to-own stores. Our Acima locations rely on our third-party retail partners to deliver merchandise leased by the customer, or for the customer to carry-out leased merchandise. Our third-party retail partners typically charge us a fee for delivery, which we pass on to the customer. 
Product maintenance and replacement. In our Rent-A-Center Business, and in the Acima business where required by law, we provide any required service or repair without additional charge, except in the event of damage in excess of normal wear and tear and certain other limited circumstances. The cost to repair the merchandise may be reimbursed by the vendor if the item is still under factory warranty. If the product cannot be repaired at the customer’s residence, we provide a temporary replacement while the product is being repaired. If the product cannot be repaired, we will replace it with a product of comparable quality, age and condition.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is focused on growing our business model through emphasis on the following key initiatives:
•executing on market opportunities and enhancing our competitive position across both traditional and virtual lease-to-own solutions;
•accelerating the shift to e-commerce, expanding product categories, including into emerging product categories, and improving the fully integrated customer experience;
•using technology to support frictionless retailer onboarding with seamless integration to retailers' platforms;
•continuing to generate repeat business while expanding our potential customer base;
•leveraging the integration of the Acima Holdings decision engine and expanding digital payments and communication channels; and
•generating favorable adjusted EBITDA margin and strong free cash flow to fund strategic priorities and deliver and return capital to shareholders.
As we pursue our strategy, we may take advantage of merger and acquisition opportunities from time to time that advance our key initiatives, and engage in discussions regarding these opportunities, which could include mergers, consolidations or acquisitions or dispositions or other transactions, although there can be no assurance that any such activities will be consummated.

Our Operating Segments
We report financial operating performance under four operating segments. To better reflect the Company's current strategic focus, our retail partner business operations are reported as the Acima segment (formerly Preferred Lease), which includes our virtual and staffed business models; and our company-owned stores and e-commerce platform through rentacenter.com are reported as the Rent-A-Center Business segment. In addition, we report operating results for our Mexico and Franchising segments. Additional information regarding our operating segments is presented in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and financial 
information regarding these segments and revenues by geographic area are provided in Note T to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Substantially all of our revenues for the past three years originated in the United States.
Acima
Our Acima segment, which operates in the United States and Puerto Rico, includes the operations of Acima Holdings acquired in February 2021 and our virtual and staffed locations (previously branded as our Preferred Lease locations), and generally offers the lease-to-own transaction to consumers who do not qualify for financing from the retailer. The Acima segment offers the lease-to-own transaction through our virtual offering solutions and Acima ecosystem, and through staffed and unstaffed kiosks located within third party retailer locations.
During 2021, we integrated the virtual offering solutions within our then existing Preferred Lease platform with the Acima Holdings virtual platform to provide retailers and consumers an expanded set of innovative solutions to enter into lease-to-own transactions. Our virtual offering solutions allow consumers to enjoy the benefits of the Company’s flexible lease-to-own solutions across e-commerce, digital, and mobile channels. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, the Preferred Lease segment was renamed the Acima segment and includes the results of Acima Holdings from the date of acquisition.
We neither require nor perform a formal credit investigation for the approval of the lease-to-own transaction through our Acima virtual offerings and on-site locations, although we do rely on certain information from consumer reporting agencies as part of our decisioning process that may constitute a "consumer report" under applicable law. We use a proprietary automated process to confirm certain customer information for approval of the lease purchase agreement. We believe our lease-to-own solutions within the Acima segment are beneficial for both the retailer and the consumer. The retailer captures more sales and reduces their payment risk because we buy the merchandise directly from them. We believe consumers also benefit from our Acima model because they are able to obtain the products they want and need without the necessity of relying on credit to finance a purchase. We generally pay the retail price for merchandise purchased from our retail partners and subsequently leased to the customer. Through certain retail partners, we offer our customers the option to obtain ownership of the product at or slightly above the full retail price if they pay within 90 days. In some cases, the retailer provides us a rebate on the cost of the merchandise if the customer exercises this 90-day option. 
Our Acima operating model is highly agile and dynamic given our virtual offerings and our ability to open and close staffed and unstaffed locations quickly and efficiently. Generally, our Acima staffed locations consist of an area with a computer, desk and chairs. We occupy the space without charge by agreement with each retailer. In our virtual locations, transactions are initiated through an electronic portal accessible by retail partners on their store computers, on our retail partners' e-commerce sites or through our Acima ecosystem including the Acima mobile application. Accordingly, capital expenditures with respect to new Acima locations are minimal. 
Acima relies on our third-party retail partners to deliver merchandise leased by the customer. Such third-party retail partners typically charge us a fee for delivery, which we pass on to the customer. In the event the customer returns rented merchandise, we pick it up at no additional charge. Most merchandise returned from an Acima lease-to-own transaction is subsequently donated or offered for rental at one of our Rent-A-Center Business stores.
Rent-A-Center Business
Our Rent-A-Center Business includes our company-owned stores in the United States and Puerto Rico and our e-commerce platform rentacenter.com. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 1,846 company-owned stores in the United States and Puerto Rico, including 45 retail installment sales stores under the names “Get It Now” and “Home Choice.” We routinely evaluate the locations in which we operate to optimize our store network. Our Rent-A-Center Business segment comprised approximately 44% of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Mexico
Our Mexico segment consists primarily of our company-owned lease-to-own stores in Mexico. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 123 stores in Mexico. 
Franchising
The stores in our Franchising segment use our Rent-A-Center, ColorTyme or RimTyme trade names, service marks, trademarks and logos, and operate under distinctive operating procedures and standards. Franchising's sources of revenue include the sale of merchandise to its franchisees who, in turn, offer the merchandise to the general public for rent or purchase under a lease-to-own transaction, and royalties collected from franchisees based on a percentage of revenue. 
As of December 31, 2021, we franchised 466 stores in 32 states operating under the Rent-A-Center (401 stores), ColorTyme (28 stores) and RimTyme (37 stores) trade names. These lease-to-own stores primarily offer high quality products such as furniture and accessories, consumer electronics, appliances, computers, wheels and tires.
As franchisor, Franchising receives royalties of 2.0% to 6.0% of the franchisees’ monthly gross revenue and, generally, an initial fee up to $10,000 per new location.
The following table summarizes our locations allocated among these operating segments as of December 31 of each of the years indicated below:
 | 2021 | 2020 | | 2019
Rent-A-Center Business | 1,846 | | 1,845 | | 1,973
Mexico | 123 | | 121 | | 123 
Franchising | 466 | | 462 | | 372 
Total locations(1) | 2,435 | | 2,428 | | 2,468

(1) Does not include locations in our Acima segment.
The following discussion applies generally to all of our operating segments, unless otherwise noted.
Operations
Store Expenses
Our expenses primarily relate to merchandise costs and the cost of operating our stores, including salaries and benefits for our employees, occupancy expense for our leased real estate, advertising expenses, lost, damaged, or stolen merchandise, fixed asset depreciation, and other expenses.
Product Selection
The stores in our Rent-A-Center Business, Mexico, and Franchising segments generally offer merchandise from certain basic product categories: furniture and accessories, appliances, consumer electronics, computers, tablets and smartphones, tools, tires, handbags and other accessories. Although we seek to maintain sufficient inventory in our stores to offer customers a wide variety of models, styles and brands, we generally limit merchandise to prescribed levels to maintain strict inventory controls. We seek to provide a wide variety of high quality merchandise to our customers, and we emphasize products from name-brand manufacturers. Customers may request either new merchandise or previously leased merchandise. Previously leased merchandise is generally offered at a similar weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly lease rate as is offered for new merchandise, but with an opportunity to obtain ownership of the merchandise after fewer lease payments.
Our furniture products include dining room, living room and bedroom furniture featuring a number of styles, materials and colors. Accessories include lamps and tables and are typically rented as part of a package of items, such as a complete room of furniture. Showroom displays enable customers to visualize how the product will look in their homes and provide a showcase for accessories. Appliances include refrigerators, freezers, washing machines, dryers, and ranges. Consumer electronic products offered by our stores include high definition televisions, home theater systems, video game consoles and stereos. We offer desktop, laptop, tablet computers and smartphones. 
The merchandise assortment may vary in our non-U.S. stores according to market characteristics and consumer demand unique to the particular country in which we are operating. For example, in Mexico, the appliances we offer are sourced locally, providing our customers in Mexico the look and feel to which they are accustomed in that product category.
Acima locations offer merchandise available for sale through third-party retailers, primarily including furniture and accessories, consumer electronics and appliances, wheels and tires, and jewelry.
Product Turnover
On average, in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, a rental term of 16 months or exercising an early purchase option is generally required to obtain ownership of new merchandise. Product turnover is the number of times a product is rented to a different customer. On average, a product is rented (turned over) to multiple customers before a customer acquires ownership. Merchandise returned in the Acima segment is moved to a Rent-A-Center Business store where it is offered for rent. Ownership is attained in approximately 42% of rental purchase agreements in the Rent-A-Center Business segment. The average total life for each product in our Rent-A-Center Business segment is approximately 15 months, which includes the initial rental period, all re-rental periods and idle time in our system. To cover the higher operating expenses generated by the key benefits of rental purchase transactions and product turnover, rental purchase agreements require higher aggregate payments to obtain ownership over time (if elected by the customer) than are generally charged under other types of purchase plans, such as installment purchase or credit plans.
Collections
In our Rent-A-Center Business store, managers use our management information system to track collections on a daily basis. Similarly, collections are monitored on a daily basis by on-site employees in our Acima staffed locations and by our back-office collections team in respect of our Acima virtual locations. If a customer fails to make a rental payment when due, we will attempt to contact the customer to terminate the account and arrange to regain possession of our merchandise or, if elected by the customer, to obtain payment and reinstate the agreement.
We attempt to recover the rental items as soon as possible following non-renewal or termination of a rental purchase agreement. Collection efforts are enhanced by the personal and job-related references required of customers, the personal nature of the relationships in our Rent-A-Center Business segment between our employees and customers, and the availability of lifetime reinstatement. 
Currently, we track past due amounts using a guideline of seven days in our Rent-A-Center Business segment and 30 days in the Acima segment. These metrics align with the majority of the rental purchase agreements in each segment, since payments are generally made weekly in the Rent-A-Center Business segment and monthly in the Acima segment.
If a customer does not return the merchandise or make a payment sufficient to reinstate an agreement, the remaining book value of the rental merchandise associated with delinquent accounts is generally charged off on or before the 90th day following the time the account became past due in the Rent-A-Center Business and Mexico segments, and during the month following the 120th day in our virtual business or 150th day in our staffed locations in the Acima segment.
Purchasing
In our Acima segment, we purchase the merchandise selected by the customer from the applicable third-party retailer at the time such customer enters into a lease purchase agreement with us. As in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, Acima retains ownership of the leased property unless and until the customer elects to purchase the property pursuant to the lease terms.
In our Rent-A-Center Business and Mexico segments, we purchase our rental merchandise from a variety of suppliers. In 2021, approximately 21% and 11% of our merchandise purchases were attributable to Ashley Furniture Industries and Whirlpool, respectively. No other brand accounted for more than 10% of merchandise purchased during these periods. We do not generally enter into written contracts with our suppliers that obligate us to meet certain minimum purchasing levels. Although we expect to continue relationships with our existing suppliers, we believe there are numerous sources of products available, and we do not believe the success of our operations is dependent on any one or more of our present suppliers.
With respect to our Franchising segment, our franchise agreements with franchisees require the franchised stores to exclusively offer for rent or sale only those brands, types and models of products that Franchising has approved. The franchised stores are required to maintain an adequate mix of inventory that consists of approved products for rent as dictated by Franchising policy manuals. Franchisees can purchase product through us or directly from various approved suppliers.
Management
Our executive management team has extensive experience in the lease-to-own industry, as well as financial services and technology, and has demonstrated the ability to grow and manage our business through their operational leadership and strategic vision. Our regional and district managers generally have long tenures with us, and we have a history of promoting management personnel from within. To support our strategic efforts in our virtual and e-commerce business solutions, we have hired additional key management members in recent years, including our Executive Vice President of Acima, who brings extensive experience and a proven track record of innovation in financial services and financial technology.
We believe our executive management team's extensive industry and company experience will allow us to effectively execute our strategies.
Marketing
We promote our products and services through television and digital radio commercials, print advertisements, store telemarketing, digital display advertisements, direct email campaigns, social networks, paid and organic search, website and store signage. Our advertisements emphasize such features as product and name-brand selection, the opportunity to pay as you go without relying on credit to finance a purchase and without requiring long-term contracts or obligations, convenient delivery and set-up , product repair and loaner services, lifetime reinstatement and multiple options to acquire ownership if desired by the customer, including early purchase pricing options or through a fixed number of payments. In addition, in the Rent-A-Center Business segment, we promote the “RAC Worry-Free Guarantee®” to further highlight these aspects of the lease purchase transaction. We believe that by leveraging our advertising efforts to highlight the benefits of the lease purchase transaction, we will continue to educate our customers and potential customers about the lease-to-own alternative to credit as well as solidify our reputation as a leading provider of high-quality, branded merchandise and services.
Franchising has established national advertising funds for the franchised stores, whereby Franchising has the right to collect up to 4.5% of the monthly gross revenue from each franchisee as contributions to the fund. Franchising directs the advertising programs of the fund, generally consisting of television and radio commercials and print advertisements. Franchising also has the right to require franchisees to expend up to 3% of their monthly gross revenue on local advertising.
Industry & Competition
According to data released by the Fair Isaac Corporation on August 17, 2021, consumers in the “subprime” category (those with credit scores below 650) made up approximately 25% of the United States population. Approximately 40% of U.S. consumers have incomes below $50,000 and may lack access to traditional credit. The lease-to-own industry provides customers the opportunity to obtain merchandise they might otherwise be unable to obtain due to insufficient cash resources or a lack of access to credit.
Our stores, kiosks and other lease-to-own operations compete with other national, regional and local lease-to-own businesses, including on-line only competitors, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. With respect to customers desiring to purchase merchandise for cash or on credit, we also compete with retail stores, online competitors, and non-traditional lenders. Competition is based primarily on convenience, store location, product selection and availability, customer service, and lease rates and terms. 
Seasonality
Our revenue mix is moderately seasonal, with the first quarter of each fiscal year generally providing higher merchandise sales than any other quarter during a fiscal year. Generally, our customers will more frequently exercise the early purchase option on their existing lease purchase agreements or purchase pre-leased merchandise off the showroom floor during the first quarter of each fiscal year, primarily due to the receipt of federal income tax refunds. 
Trademarks
We own various trademarks and service marks that are used in connection with our operations and have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The duration of our trademarks is unlimited, subject to periodic renewal and continued use. In addition, we have obtained trademarks and filed for trademark registrations in Mexico and certain other foreign jurisdictions. We believe we hold the necessary rights for protection of the trademarks and service marks essential to our business. The products held for rent in our stores or through our host retailer partners also bear trademarks and service marks held by their respective manufacturers.
The Franchising segment licenses the use of the Rent-A-Center® and ColorTyme® trademarks and service marks to its franchisees under its franchise agreements with such franchisees. The Franchising segment owns various trademarks and service marks, including ColorTyme® and RimTyme®, that are used in connection with its operations and have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark office. The duration of these marks is unlimited, subject to periodic renewal and continued use.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we employed a total of 14,290 coworkers, the vast majority of which are full time employees. Our employee base is made up of 12,480 coworkers in our U.S. Operations, including Puerto Rico, 1,330 coworkers in our Mexico operations and 480 coworkers at our corporate facilities.
We continually monitor our demand for labor and provide training and competitive compensation packages in an effort to attract and retain skilled coworkers. We believe our coworkers are one of the primary keys to successfully operating our business and achieving our strategic initiatives. Our human capital measures and objectives focus on the successful training and development of our coworkers, in addition to their safety. All of our coworkers are employed at will and are free to end their employment with us at any time. 
We also focus on supporting a diverse and inclusive workforce. Our Chief Diversity Officer regularly reports to our Board of Directors. We have also implemented a program to deliver unconscious bias training to our employees and have launched and are expanding our Employee Resource Groups to promote a dialogue with our employees regarding our diversity initiatives.
Government Regulation of Lease-to-Own Transactions
State Regulation. Currently, 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have rental purchase statutes that recognize and regulate rental purchase transactions as separate and distinct from credit sales. We believe this existing legislation is generally favorable to us, as it defines and clarifies the various disclosures, procedures and transaction structures related to the lease-to-own business with which we must comply. With some variations in individual states, most related state legislation requires the lessor to make prescribed disclosures to customers about the rental purchase agreement and transaction, and provides time periods during which customers may reinstate agreements despite having failed to make a timely payment. Some state rental purchase laws prescribe grace periods for non-payment, prohibit or limit certain types of collection or other practices, and limit certain fees that may be charged. Eleven states limit the total rental payments that can be charged to amounts ranging from 2.0 times to 2.4 times the disclosed cash price or the retail value of the rental product. Six of those eleven states also limit the cash price of merchandise to amounts ranging from 1.56 to 2.5 times our cost for each item.
Although Minnesota has a rental purchase statute, the rental purchase transaction is also treated as a credit sale subject to consumer lending restrictions pursuant to judicial decision. Therefore, we offer our customers in Minnesota an opportunity to purchase our merchandise through an installment sale transaction in our Home Choice stores. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 18 Home Choice stores in Minnesota.
North Carolina has no rental purchase legislation. However, the retail installment sales statute in North Carolina expressly provides that lease transactions which provide for more than a nominal purchase price at the end of the agreed rental period are not credit sales under the statute. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 86 lease-to-own stores and 35 Acima staffed locations in North Carolina.
Courts in Wisconsin and New Jersey, which do not have rental purchase statutes, have rendered decisions which classify rental purchase transactions as credit sales subject to consumer lending restrictions. Accordingly, in Wisconsin, we offer our customers an opportunity to purchase our merchandise through an installment sale transaction in our Get It Now stores. In New Jersey, we have modified our typical rental purchase agreements to provide disclosures, grace periods, and pricing that we believe comply with the retail installment sales act. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 27 Get It Now stores in Wisconsin and 40 Rent-A-Center stores in New Jersey. 
In addition to state lease-to-own laws as described above, general consumer protection laws and regulations adopted by states may also impact our business. There can be no assurance as to whether changes in the enforcement of existing state laws or regulations or the enactment of new laws or regulations that may unfavorably impact the lease-to-own industry would have a material and adverse effect on us.
Federal Regulation. To date, no comprehensive federal legislation has been enacted regulating the rental purchase transaction. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) does not regulate leases with terms of 90 days or less. Because the lease-to-own transaction is for a term of week to week, or at most, month to month, and established federal law deems the term of a lease to be its minimum term regardless of extensions or renewals, if any, we believe the lease-
to-own transaction is not covered by the Dodd-Frank Act. General consumer protection laws and regulations adopted at the federal level, however, may impact our business.
From time to time, we have supported legislation introduced in Congress that would regulate the rental purchase transaction. While both beneficial and adverse legislation regulating the rental purchase transaction may be introduced in Congress in the future, any adverse federal legislation, if enacted, could have a material and adverse effect on us. In addition, there can be no assurance as to whether changes in the enforcement of existing federal consumer protection laws or regulations or the enactment of new laws or regulations that may unfavorably impact the lease-to-own industry would have a material and adverse effect on us.
Mexico
No comprehensive legislation regulating the lease-to-own transaction has been enacted in Mexico. We use substantially the same rental purchase transaction in Mexico as in the U.S. stores, but with such additional provisions as we believe may be necessary to comply with Mexico’s specific laws and customs.
Available Information
We file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, periodic reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. The public may obtain copies of these reports and any amendments at the SEC's Internet site, www.sec.gov.

We also provide electronic or paper copies of our filings free of charge upon request. In addition, our Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to all members of our Board of Directors, as well as all of our employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, principal accounting officer and controller. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics forms the foundation of a compliance program we established as part of our commitment to responsible business practices that includes policies, training, monitoring and other components covering a wide variety of specific areas applicable to our business activities and employee conduct. A copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is published on our website at https://investor.rentacenter.com/governance-documents. We intend to make all required disclosures concerning any amendments to, or waivers from, this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics on our website.
