Item 1. Business
Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on applying monoclonal antibody immunotherapies to address serious infectious diseases. We believe that our monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, offer a novel approach to address serious infections. Unlike antibiotics that propagate resistance, disrupt both disease-causing and beneficial bacteria and have adverse off-target effects, mAbs have the ability to precisely bind only to the intended target, thereby avoiding these undesired consequences. Our lead product candidate, ASN100, is a first-in-class mAb therapeutic in Phase 2 clinical development for the prevention of Staphylococcus aureus, or S. aureus, pneumonia in high-risk, mechanically ventilated patients, a potentially life-threatening and costly infection for which there are no approved preventive therapies. In addition to ASN100, our preclinical pipeline is comprised of mAbs targeting multiple serious bacterial and viral pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. 
 Monoclonal antibodies are a well-established therapeutic class across many disease areas; however, they have yet to be broadly utilized for the prevention or treatment of acute bacterial and viral infections, where they hold the potential to address serious unmet medical needs. Our expertise lies in applying our deep understanding of the pathogenesis of infection paired with our ability to access some of the most advanced mAb discovery techniques and platforms available today. We have used this expertise to discover and develop novel mAbs with multiple mechanisms of action and high potency against their intended targets. 
 Our lead product candidate, ASN100, is a combination of two fully human mAbs that we are developing to address S. aureus cytotoxins, which are bacterial toxins that destroy human cells. Only recently has it become fully understood that S. aureus bacteria propagate disease in the lung through the production of up to six pathogenic cytotoxins that damage human lung tissue and destroy human immune cells. Antibiotics do not address these cytotoxins and can actually increase their production. ASN100 was developed specifically to neutralize the six cytotoxins critical to S. aureus pneumonia pathogenesis, a scientific advancement that has not previously been achieved. 
 S. aureus is the leading cause of pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients in the United States and the second leading cause of pneumonia in this patient population in Europe. There are more than one million mechanically ventilated patients in the United States each year, most of whom are treated in intensive care units, or ICUs. Based on published epidemiology data, up to approximately 20% of these patients are at high risk of progressing to S. aureus pneumonia, even when best-available prevention strategies are used. Despite the availability of antibiotic treatments, outcomes of ventilator-associated pneumonia, or VAP, are poor, with high mortality rates and incremental hospital costs of approximately $40,000 per case. We believe ASN100 has the potential to improve the standard of care from suboptimal prevention and treatment to efficient and effective pre-emptive therapy. Moreover, given its product profile, ASN100 aligns well with accepted preventive hospital quality measures and antimicrobial stewardship efforts to reduce infections and antibiotic use. 
 In early 2017, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of ASN100 for the prevention of S. aureus pneumonia in high-risk, mechanically ventilated patients. We plan to enroll 354 patients in this double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who develop S. aureus pneumonia during the 21-day period following a single dose of ASN100 as compared to placebo. The superiority design of the trial differs from traditional antibiotic trials, which are consistently designed to demonstrate non-inferiority compared to the applicable standard of care. In the first half of 2018, by which we expect approximately one-third of the 354 total target patients will have been dosed and assessed through 21 days following dosing, we plan to have an independent data review committee conduct an interim analysis to assess the probability that the trial will succeed as designed. The analysis will either confirm the assumptions underlying our trial design, resulting in a recommendation that we continue the trial as designed, recommend an increase in the total number of patients to be dosed or advise that the trial is unlikely to achieve statistical significance as designed. We will remain blinded to the data and calculations underlying the analysis and will only receive recommendations on how to proceed. Assuming that this analysis does not identify any recommended changes in the number of patients to be enrolled and recommends that the trial continue, we expect to report top-line efficacy results from completion of the trial in the second half of 2018. Assuming positive top-line safety and efficacy results, we expect to use these data to design a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial as well as inform the potential clinical development of ASN100 in additional indications. 
 We have completed a Phase 1 dose-ranging trial in 52 healthy volunteers, in which 18 of these healthy volunteers received ASN100 at doses equivalent to or greater than the Phase 2 clinical trial dose. ASN100 was well tolerated across all doses tested, including doses greater than twice the Phase 2 clinical trial dose, and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. ASN100 plasma half-life exceeded three weeks and lung concentrations were above levels required for cytotoxin neutralization based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling. Based on these results, we believe that a single preventive dose of ASN100 may be able to safely neutralize S. aureus cytotoxins and prevent pneumonia in high-risk, mechanically ventilated patients.

Our second program, ASN500, targets RSV, a virus that afflicts in aggregate over two million young children and elderly and immunocompromised patients annually in the United States, and can cause serious respiratory tract infections. We are currently evaluating mAbs that have exhibited exceptionally high potency against RSV in a laboratory setting, which may support development of a preventive therapy for use in multiple high-risk patient populations not addressed by the currently approved therapy. We expect to advance this mAb into Phase 1 clinical trials in the second half of 2019. 
 We are also seeking external funding or collaboration for the continued development of two programs targeting Gram-negative infections, ASN300 for Klebsiella pneumoniae and ASN200 for Escherichia coli, by applying a precise and multi-modal mAb approach against novel targets to allow for potential use in both preventive and treatment settings, with a goal of providing safe and effective alternatives to small molecule antibiotics, particularly against multi-drug resistant strains. We have selected lead development candidates for each of these programs. 
 We have assembled a proven management team with years of highly relevant experience to enable the successful advancement of our product candidates. Our team has been collectively involved in the discovery, development and commercialization of over 20 marketed anti-infective drugs and biologics. Several members of our team previously held management positions at Cubist Pharmaceuticals, a leading anti-infective company that was acquired by Merck in 2015. Our programs are derived from the expertise of our founding scientists, who are widely recognized experts in monoclonal antibody drug discovery and infectious disease biology, and the capabilities of our broader scientific team, which span immunology and bacterial and viral pathogenesis. 
 Our clinical and scientific advisory boards are comprised of preeminent experts in infectious diseases, critical care and bacterial and viral pathogenesis. 
 Our Pipeline 
 The following chart summarizes information about our product candidates and programs. 

The Need for New Approaches for the Management of Infectious Diseases 
 The management of infectious diseases is a global problem that is inadequately addressed by currently marketed anti-infective drugs. Infections remain among the leading causes of preventable deaths worldwide, cause significant morbidity and place a substantial cost burden on healthcare systems. For decades, the standard of care for bacterial infections has been antibiotic-based treatment. However, the extensive use of antibiotics has led to the spread of antibiotic resistance, rendering these therapies increasingly ineffective in addressing serious infections and resulting in a global health crisis. 
 4


Despite the fact that outcomes of many serious infections remain poor, the current approach to many of these infections is to treat rather than proactively prevent them. Currently marketed antibiotics are often inappropriate for preventive therapy for a variety of reasons. For example, as the lack of specificity of antibiotics results in the propagation of resistance and indiscriminate damage to beneficial host bacteria, often referred to as a patient’s microbiome, as well as adverse off-target effects. In addition, for certain viral diseases, preventive vaccinations are not available to many in-need patient populations or are ineffective. For example, the low potency and short half-life of currently available RSV antibody prophylaxis leads to high cost and the need for monthly injections, and is therefore used only in the highest-risk newborns in developed countries, leaving many young children and elderly and immunocompromised patients unserved and at risk of infection. We believe that our highly potent and selective mAb product candidates have the potential to yield safe and effective preventive therapies while addressing the shortcomings of current therapies. 
 Our Approach: Monoclonal Antibodies 
 Monoclonal antibodies offer the potential to prevent and treat serious infections, while reducing the threat of antibiotic resistance and supporting hospital quality and antimicrobial stewardship initiatives. We are developing our mAb immunotherapies to minimize the shortcomings associated with currently approved anti-infective therapies. Unlike antibiotics, which target bacteria indiscriminately, our mAbs selectively target disease-causing bacteria indirectly by disarming their pathogenic processes, as is the case with ASN100, and also in some cases directly by targeting cell surface molecules. 
 Our lead mAb programs target two important pathogens: S. aureus, the most prevalent hospital pathogen in many serious acute infections, with high rates of antibiotic resistance and poor clinical and health-economic outcomes, and RSV, a respiratory pathogen that can cause serious lower respiratory infections requiring hospitalization in young children and elderly and immunocompromised patients. 
 Our Product Candidates 
 Our Lead Product Candidate: ASN100 
 ASN100, a first-in-class monoclonal antibody product candidate, is a combination of two fully human mAbs that are co-administered intravenously to neutralize the six cytotoxins critical to S. aureus pneumonia pathogenesis. By specifically targeting these cytotoxins, we believe ASN100 can prevent infection and avoid the shortcomings of antibiotics. ASN100 is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the prevention of S. aureus pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients at high risk for S. aureus pneumonia, and has received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for this indication.

S. aureus in Mechanically Ventilated Patients 
 Mechanical ventilation is used to assist or replace spontaneous breathing in patients who need respiratory support while recovering from medical conditions, surgical procedures or traumatic events. There are over one million mechanically ventilated patients each year in the United States. The endotracheal tube used to deliver oxygen from a ventilator to a patient’s lungs serves as a conduit through which S. aureus and other pathogens can readily transit from the patient’s normal microflora and external environment to invade and persist in the lungs. We refer to the presence of S. aureus in the lungs without the signs and symptoms of active infection as colonization. S. aureus typically appears as one of the first colonizing bacteria within eight days of the initiation of mechanical ventilation. Based on published epidemiology data, up to approximately 20% of mechanically ventilated patients become heavily colonized with S. aureus in their respiratory secretions, putting them at high risk of progressing to S. aureus pneumonia, which occurs at a rate of approximately 30% to 40% in this patient population, even when best-available prevention strategies are used. 
 

VAP is a preventable hospital-acquired infection that is responsible for significant clinical and health-economic consequences. The specific adverse consequences of VAP, whether caused by S. aureus or any other pathogen, include high mortality, significant resource and cost burden to ICUs and negative impact on hospital quality metrics. In particular, all-cause mortality in patients with VAP ranges from 20% to 50%, and VAP is associated with extension of the duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay by approximately 12 and 13 days, respectively, with associated incremental cost to the hospital of approximately $40,000 per case, despite the use of best-available antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, the consequences of VAP in mechanically ventilated patients who are heavily colonized with S. aureus in particular are similarly severe, with an approximate two-fold increase in all-cause mortality and increased duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay of four and seven days, respectively. 
 Given the serious outcomes associated with VAP, costly time- and resource-intensive prevention strategies are routinely employed in ICUs. These activities can take up to four hours of nursing time per patient per day and interfere with other critical patient care activities. Due to the potential undesirable consequences of antibiotic therapy and documented lack of efficacy in addressing colonization, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, or IDSA, and the American Thoracic Society, or ATS, recommend against providing preventive antibiotic therapy in heavily colonized patients, leaving no therapeutic options for proactively addressing this serious infection. 
 S. aureus Pneumonia – Mechanism of Disease 
 Recently, it has been discovered that S. aureus bacteria contribute to disease progression in the lung through the production of up to six pathogenic cytotoxins that damage human lung tissue and destroy human immune cells. These cytotoxins comprise alpha-hemolysin, or Hla, and five leukocidins. Hla damages lung epithelial cells, allowing S. aureus to penetrate the lung epithelium, the cellular lining of lung tissue. This facilitates progression to pneumonia and other systemic infections. Leukocidins are cytotoxins that destroy human immune cells, eliminating patients’ ability to harness their immune systems to eradicate S. aureus through phagocytosis, the natural process of human immune cells, or phagocytes, ingesting and eliminating harmful pathogens. S. aureus can produce up to five potent leukocidins: HlgAB, HlgCB, Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL), LukED and LukGH. 
 6


Cytotoxin expression varies by S. aureus strain type and within strains over time. The vast majority of S. aureus strains carry the genes necessary to produce Hla and three of the leukocidins (HlgAB, HlgCB and LukGH). Up to 75% of strains carry the genes necessary to produce LukED, and up to 10% of strains carry the genes necessary to produce PVL. In order to broadly address S. aureus disease-causing potential, or virulence, in the lung, we believe that all six cytotoxins must be comprehensively and consistently addressed. 
 Our Solution: ASN100 
 ASN100 utilizes a novel, anti-cytotoxin approach to prevent both tissue damage and the destruction of phagocytes caused by S. aureus cytotoxins, thereby reducing the virulence, invasiveness and pathogenicity of S. aureus. ASN100 is a combination of two co-administered fully human mAbs, ASN-1 and ASN-2, that together neutralize the six S. aureus cytotoxins critical to S. aureus pneumonia pathogenesis. ASN-1 is unique among known mAbs in its ability to neutralize five different toxins: Hla and four of the five leukocidins. ASN-2 is the only mAb in development that neutralizes LukGH, the fifth and most potent leukocidin. Together, these mAbs are able to protect both the integrity of lung epithelial cells and phagocytes, potentially preventing S. aureus bacteria from invading lung tissue and allowing phagocytes to eliminate S. aureus. The pathogenesis of S. aureus pneumonia and the mechanism of action of ASN100 are depicted in the figures below. 
 
 
Our mAbs were generated by applying our deep understanding of the pathogenesis of S. aureus infection to identify antibody targets, paired with our ability to access state-of-the-art mAb discovery tools to effectively engage these targets. We identified and characterized the six S. aureus cytotoxin targets, revealing a common feature of five of these cytotoxins, Hla and four leukocidins. We then selected ASN-1, after interrogation of approximately 10 billion human mAb sequences, as the only mAb able to bind to and neutralize these five distinct targets, which it is able to do with high affinity. The sixth cytotoxin target, LukGH, has multiple sequence variants, and we selected ASN-2 for its high affinity and ability to bind to and neutralize all known sequence variants. We own or have the exclusive rights to these antibodies and antibody targets. 
 Key Advantages of ASN100 
 Multiple antibiotics are approved for the treatment of S. aureus pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients, but none are approved for its prevention. In addition to the inherent limitations of targeting treatment rather than prevention, antibiotics leave bacterial virulence factors unaddressed while their lack of specificity can result in the propagation of antibiotic resistance, cause indiscriminate damage to the patient’s microbiome and result in other off-target adverse safety effects. In light of suboptimal clinical outcomes associated with antibiotics for S. aureus pneumonia and the resulting healthcare costs and burden, we believe that a new therapeutic paradigm is needed and that ASN100 will offer the following specific benefits: 
  
• | First-in-class therapeutic with novel mechanism of action. ASN100 is the first and only therapy in development that neutralizes all six of the cytotoxins critical to the pathogenesis of S. aureus pneumonia, thereby protecting both lung epithelial cells and human immune cells. Other anti-cytotoxin monoclonal antibodies currently in development for S. aureus target only one of these six cytotoxins, Hla. We believe that, if ASN100 is approved, its novel mechanism of action will enable it to improve the standard of care from suboptimal prevention and treatment to efficient and effective pre-emptive therapy.

• | Mitigates the risk of resistance. ASN100 precisely and specifically targets S. aureus cytotoxins and not the bacteria directly. Therefore, we expect ASN100 will mitigate the risk of resistance in S. aureus strains and normal microbiome bacteria that is typically observed with antibiotics. Additionally, we believe that ASN100 will be effective in neutralizing all six S. aureus cytotoxins implicated in pneumonia pathogenesis regardless of the antibiotic resistance profile of the strain of S. aureus.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well tolerated with no off-target effects. ASN100, a fully human monoclonal antibody product candidate, precisely targets only pathogenic S. aureus cytotoxins. In preclinical studies, ASN100 demonstrated no effect on human cell targets. In a Phase 1 clinical trial, ASN100 was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities observed. The precise nature of ASN100’s mechanism to specifically target and neutralize S. aureus cytotoxins also allows the patient’s microbiome to remain unaffected by this therapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clinical trials designed for superiority. With no therapies approved for the prevention of S. aureus pneumonia, our Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating ASN100 has been designed and powered to demonstrate superiority to placebo. In the first half of 2018, we plan to have an independent data review committee conduct an interim analysis to assess the probability that the trial will succeed as currently designed. We expect that any Phase 3 clinical trial of ASN100 will be similarly designed and powered for superiority. This is in contrast to antibiotics, which treat infections only after they occur and are consistently benchmarked to be non-inferior to the applicable standard of care. Due to the superiority design of our ASN100 clinical trials, we believe that positive findings would provide a compelling demonstration to hospitals and health systems of the clinical and health-economic advantages of ASN100.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | One-time dosing and seamless integration with current preventive practices. ASN100 is being developed as a single-dose therapeutic to protect a targeted set of patients who are at high risk for S. aureus pneumonia. As part of daily ventilator hygiene practice, respiratory secretions are cleared from patients’ endotracheal tubes frequently and can be readily tested for the presence of heavy S. aureus colonization using standard microbiologic diagnostics, allowing for easy identification of these patients. For these reasons, ASN100 has the potential to be easily integrated into, and to improve the effectiveness of, current inefficient and inadequate preventive approaches.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Positive impact on health economic and quality metrics. We believe that ASN100 has the potential to show a meaningful and quantifiable impact on important health economic and hospital quality metrics. Specifically, we believe that ASN100 may demonstrate a reduction in S. aureus pneumonia rates and related lengths of ICU stay and days on mechanical ventilation, ultimately saving hospital costs and improving quality of care.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 2 Clinical Trial 
 In early 2017, we dosed the first patient with ASN100 in our Phase 2 clinical trial for the prevention of S. aureus pneumonia in high-risk, mechanically ventilated patients. This trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of ASN100 administered as a single dose. We plan to enroll 354 patients in the United States, Europe and multiple additional countries, randomized in a 1:1 ratio between study drug and placebo. The superiority design of the trial differs from traditional antibiotic trials, which are consistently designed to demonstrate non-inferiority compared to the applicable standard of care. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial is the proportion of patients who develop S. aureus pneumonia through 21 days after dosing. The trial is designed to detect a 50% reduction in the occurrence of S. aureus pneumonia in the ASN100 arm when compared to placebo pneumonia rates based on published epidemiology data. Secondary endpoints include 28-day all-cause mortality, as well as length of stay in the ICU and days on mechanical ventilation. We will also gather ASN100 safety and pharmacokinetic data, including data on the pharmacokinetics of ASN100 in the lung, the site of infection. The trial is being conducted under an investigational new drug application, or IND, that we submitted to the FDA in July 2016 for the development of ASN100 for the treatment and prevention of S. aureus infections. 
 In the first half of 2018, by which we expect approximately one-third of the 354 total target patients will have been dosed and assessed through 21 days following dosing, we plan to have an independent data review committee conduct an interim analysis to assess the probability that the trial will succeed as designed. The analysis will either confirm the assumptions underlying our trial design, resulting in a recommendation that we continue the trial as designed, recommend an increase in the total number of patients to be dosed or advise that the trial is unlikely to be achieve statistical significance as designed. We will remain blinded to the data and calculations underlying the analysis and will only receive recommendations on how to proceed. Assuming that this analysis does not identify any recommended changes in the number of patients to be enrolled and recommends that the trial continue, we expect to report top-line efficacy results from completion of the trial in the second half of 2018. Assuming positive top-line safety and efficacy results from our Phase 2 trial, we expect to use these data to design a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial as well as inform the potential clinical development of ASN100 in additional indications.

Phase 1 Clinical Data 
 We successfully completed a Phase 1 single ascending dose clinical trial in 52 healthy volunteers to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ASN100, both in the bloodstream and the lung. Forty-two volunteers received one dose of ASN-1 alone, ASN-2 alone or ASN-1 and ASN-2 in combination as ASN100, at doses of up to 4,000 mg of ASN-1 and ASN-2 alone and up to 8,000 mg of ASN100 (4,000 mg of each of ASN-1 and ASN-2 co-administered). Eighteen of these healthy volunteers received ASN100 at doses equivalent to or greater than the Phase 2 clinical trial dose. Thirty volunteers were randomized to receive active drug while 10 healthy volunteers received placebo. Twelve additional volunteers were treated in two open-label cohorts with ASN100 to gain more safety data and sample lung epithelial lining fluid, or ELF, by bronchoalveolar lavage to determine ASN100 lung penetration at 3,600 mg and 8,000 mg doses. 
 ASN100 was demonstrated to be well tolerated and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. A total of 91 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported. Of these treatment-emergent adverse events, 68 occurred in 34 of 42 (81%) volunteers receiving ASN-1, ASN-2 or ASN100 and the remaining 23 occurred in 9 of 10 (90%) volunteers receiving placebo. All treatment-emergent adverse events were transient, mild or moderate in severity and resolved without intervention. No increase in adverse events was seen with dose escalation. Two mild treatment-emergent adverse events were possibly related to study drug: one headache (200 mg of ASN-1) and one report of fatigue (8,000 mg of ASN100). No infusion-related or hypersensitivity reactions were observed for ASN-1, ASN-2 or ASN100. All volunteers completed all study assessments. Anti-drug antibody responses after dosing were measured out to 10 months following dosing and no generation of anti-drug antibodies was observed in any volunteer tested. 
 The pharmacokinetic data supported single-dose administration of ASN100 based on a greater than three-week half-life for both ASN-1 and ASN-2 administered alone or in combination as ASN100. Furthermore, as depicted in the figure below, in a sample of six patients dosed with 3,600 mg of ASN100, both ASN-1 and ASN-2 were detected in lung ELF out to 30 days after dosing. These concentrations were well above those required to neutralize cytotoxins in in vitro and in vivo studies as supported by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling. To our knowledge, ASN100 is the first mAb product candidate to be measured and reported in human lung ELF, an important and well-recognized measure for dose selection in traditional anti-infective drug development, supporting potential efficacy of ASN100 in the target indication. 
 ASN100 Phase 1 Pharmacokinetics in Serum and Lung Epithelial Fluid 
 
 
Our approach to dose selection for ASN100 was based on tolerability and serum and ELF pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers, as well as dose response in animal models of S. aureus pneumonia. These data all informed a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics model that supported the ASN100 Phase 2 dose of 3,600 mg, or approximately 40 mg/kg (20 mg/kg of each of ASN-1 and ASN-2). This dose is two times the highest dose needed to protect 100% of animals in the most challenging in vivo studies, has been well tolerated in healthy volunteers and we believe it is adequate to address the potential variability in patient lung physiology and S. aureus cytotoxin levels.

Preclinical Studies 
 We tested ASN100 in preclinical efficacy studies against a variety of common and highly virulent S. aureus strains known to produce high levels of cytotoxins, including antibiotic-resistant strains. We also conducted investigational new drug application, or IND, enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies and the results, combined with the results of our preclinical efficacy studies, support the potential use of ASN100 for the prevention of S. aureus pneumonia in high-risk, mechanically ventilated patients. The results of these preclinical studies are summarized below. 
 Preclinical Efficacy Studies
In Vivo Studies. The activity of ASN-1 was demonstrated across a variety of animal models and strains of S. aureus, including the previously established and clinically predictive rabbit model of lethal S. aureus pneumonia. In this model, study drug was dosed 24 hours prior to the introduction of a large inoculum of live S. aureus directly into the lung. Published results from this model using a prevalent and virulent methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or MRSA, strain are shown in the figure on the left below. All of the rabbits treated with 10 mg/kg of ASN-1 survived, while only 25% of rabbits treated with 10 mg/kg of a comparator mAb that targets only Hla survived and no rabbits treated with a control mAb survived. In a separately published study of MEDI4893, a mAb that targets only Hla, in this same model with the same MRSA strain, only 33% of rabbits survived when dosed with 30 mg/kg of MEDI4893, as shown in the figure on the right below. 
 Efficacy of ASN-1 and Comparator mAbs in Lethal S. aureus Pneumonia Model 
 

Consistent with these data, in independently conducted studies of ASN100 against four additional S. aureus strains, we observed 100% survival during the relevant time period for this acute pneumonia model, for all rabbits receiving 20 mg/kg of ASN100 (10 mg/kg of each of ASN-1 and ASN-2). 
 In addition to prevention models, the activity of ASN100 alone and in combination with antibiotics was also studied in an animal model of pneumonia treatment. In this model, ASN100 exhibited activity when administered alone and exhibited notable potentiation of antibiotics’ effects at sub-therapeutic doses across three antibiotic classes. 
 Overall, the data from our in vivo studies of ASN100 suggest that neutralizing bacterial cytotoxins prevents S. aureus pneumonia, highlight the importance of broad neutralization of the six cytotoxins critical to S. aureus pneumonia pathogenesis and support the use of ASN100 in patients receiving concomitant antibiotics. 
 In Vitro Studies. Results from in vitro experiments across a wide variety of S. aureus strains demonstrated that ASN100 consistently neutralized the six targeted S. aureus cytotoxins thereby protecting both human lung epithelial cells from destruction by Hla and human phagocytes from destruction by the five leukocidins critical to S. aureus pneumonia pathogenesis. In vitro experiments also demonstrated that a 1:1 ratio of ASN-1 and ASN-2, the two mAbs comprising ASN100, was optimal to consistently neutralize all five of the leukocidins and protect human phagocytes across a wide variety of S. aureus strains. ASN-1 was also tested in a human tracheobronchial epithelial tissue culture model to assess the role of Hla neutralization in preventing lung tissue damage, demonstrating complete protection of lung epithelial tissue from cytotoxin damage in this model.

Non-Clinical Safety Studies 
 We conducted in vivo toxicology studies of ASN100 in rats. No clinical observations, no body weight changes and no macroscopic or microscopic effects that were considered related to study treatment were seen when ASN100 was administered at doses of 300 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg. Based on these results, we determined a no-observed-effect level of ASN100 of 600 mg/kg, which is approximately 10-fold higher than the dose being studied in our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of ASN100. Additionally, an in vitro study of ASN-1, ASN-2 and ASN100 demonstrated no human tissue cross-reactivity, as expected given that ASN-1 and ASN-2 specifically target bacterial cytotoxins. 
 Commercial Rationale and Strategy 
 We believe there is a significant commercial opportunity for ASN100 for the prevention of S. aureus pneumonia in high-risk, mechanically ventilated patients. If ASN100 is approved, we expect to focus our initial commercial efforts in the United States and potentially Europe, which we believe represent the largest market opportunities for ASN100. In other markets, we plan to evaluate the merits of entering into commercialization agreements with partners who have local market expertise and capabilities. 
 We plan to deploy a highly targeted sales force to promote ASN100 to ICU healthcare professionals. The ICU is a contained setting within most hospitals and the burden of VAP is borne entirely by this unit. Unlike antibiotics, which typically target a broad patient population and can be used by many physician specialties, ASN100 targets a contained patient population within the ICU. We therefore believe that ASN100 uptake will not be limited by traditional restrictive hospital antibiotic usage policies. We also believe that a single-dose administration of ASN100 has the potential to be readily and easily integrated into and improve the effectiveness of current inefficient and inadequate preventive approaches. 
 Hospitalizations involving mechanical ventilations represent approximately 12% of all hospital costs in the United States. Moreover, in their published guidelines, the IDSA and the ATS estimate incremental cost associated with VAP infections to be approximately $40,000 per patient in the United States. We believe that the potential advantages of ASN100, including superior clinical outcomes and measurable health-economic benefits, will drive significant physician demand. We also believe that pricing for a preventive therapy could be supported by the estimated cost savings associated with preventing one case of S. aureus pneumonia combined with a number needed to treat, or NNT, analysis, which is an analysis that quantifies the number of patients needed to be treated with a therapeutic in order to prevent one case of disease. 
 We believe that the current hospital reimbursement environment in the United States and Europe will also support our commercialization efforts for ASN100. In addition to seeking to control costs, hospitals are facing increasing pressure to improve quality of care metrics. For example, one of the largest payors in the United States, Medicare, has increased the use of financial incentives to improve quality of care across many metrics as well as the use of penalties for suboptimal performance, placing individual hospitals at risk of losing millions of dollars in reimbursement per year. These quality measures include, but are not limited to, the ability of a hospital to prevent hospital-acquired infections and reduce readmissions. With S. aureus pneumonia infections in mechanically ventilated patients being associated with an almost two-fold increase in readmission rates, we believe that ASN100 has the potential to offer significant health-economic benefits to hospitals in this area of need. 
 Additional Indications and Markets 
 S. aureus is a leading cause of many serious infections and is responsible for approximately 45% of skin infections, 45% of pneumonias and 20% of bloodstream infections treated in U.S. hospitals. Each year, over two million antibiotic prescriptions are written for the more than 1.7 million hospital-treated patients in the United States with confirmed S. aureus infections. Clinical consequences can be severe with, for example, reported mortality of approximately 40% in MRSA bloodstream infections. S. aureus cytotoxins often play a key role in these infections. We believe the unique attributes of ASN100 could be applied to additional indications to expand the potential use of ASN100 to prevent or treat other serious S. aureus infections in patients at high risk of infection. 
 Due to the need for improved treatment outcomes for S. aureus pneumonia and preclinical evidence of ASN100’s potentiation of antibiotic effects, the first indication that we plan to pursue for ASN100 beyond prevention of S. aureus pneumonia in high-risk, mechanically ventilated patients is treatment of S. aureus pneumonia. Approximately 250,000 patients per year are treated in U.S. hospitals for S. aureus pneumonia infections, with an associated mortality rate of up to 50% in certain patient populations. At the sites for our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of ASN100 for the prevention of S. aureus pneumonia in high-risk, mechanically ventilated patients, we plan to collect exploratory data on the safety and efficacy of ASN100 for the treatment of S. aureus pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients who do not meet the enrollment criteria for the trial due to having already developed pneumonia. We anticipate the results of this analysis will be available in the second half of 2018. 
 11


Other potential indications we are currently considering include: S. aureus pulmonary exacerbations in patients with cystic fibrosis, S. aureus bloodstream infections, S. aureus infections in high-risk surgical patients and certain serious complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by S. aureus. We anticipate that the data from our current ASN100 development program, including the results of the Phase 2 clinical trial, will continue to inform the development of ASN100 in these or other indications. 
 Our RSV Program: ASN500 
 Our ASN500 program, comprised of mAbs targeting RSV for which we have observed high potency in preclinical in vitro and in vivo models, is currently in its lead-optimization phase. We believe ASN500, which we are developing for the prevention of RSV infection, will have the potential to offer benefits over existing preventive therapies in terms of potency, dosing strategy, manufacturing and route of administration, to better serve both new and existing target populations. We expect to advance this mAb, once selected, into Phase 1 clinical trials in 2019. In the near term, we plan to advance this program entirely with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, referred to herein as the Gates Foundation. 
 RSV is a highly contagious virus that infects nearly every child at least once by the age of two and is a major cause of hospitalization due to respiratory infection in young children and elderly and immunocompromised patients. RSV infections can lead to serious respiratory complications, such as croup, pneumonia and bronchiolitis, as well as, in extreme cases, death. In the United States, an estimated 2.1 million children under the age of five with RSV infection require medical attention each year, and of these, approximately 60,000 are hospitalized. In the elderly and high-risk adult populations in the United States, RSV infection accounts for an estimated 180,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths per year. Prophylaxis for RSV infection with an approved mAb product is used, but only to a limited extent, in the United States and in some other middle-to-high income countries in a narrow population of extremely premature infants or in those with congenital heart disease. This product’s high cost and requirement for monthly dosing limit its use in resource-constrained settings. As such, there remains a need for novel, cost-effective approaches to the management of RSV infection in multiple large patient populations. 
 Our Gram-Negative Programs: ASN300 and ASN200 
 Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for some of the most lethal hospital-acquired infections, such as bloodstream infections and pneumonia. Due to increasing antibiotic resistance, there are few remaining effective treatment options for these serious infections, necessitating new approaches. Our Gram-negative programs, ASN300 for Klebsiella pneumoniae and ASN200 for Escherichia coli, apply a precise and multi-modal mAb approach against novel targets to allow for potential use in both preventive and treatment settings, with a goal of providing safe and effective alternatives to small molecule antibiotics, particularly against multi-drug resistant strains. We have selected lead development candidates for our ASN300 and ASN200 programs based on data generated in in vitro assays, in vivo infection models, manufacturability assessments and toxicology studies. In these studies, we have observed, among other things, activity of these product candidates in in vivo models of infection prevention and, with respect to ASN200, potentiation of antibiotic effect in in vitro assays. We are currently seeking external funding or collaborators to further the preclinical and future potential clinical development of these programs. 
 Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and government agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Some of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. These same competitors may invent technology that competes with our product candidates. 
 Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 12


We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, health-economic benefit, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic or biosimilar competition and the availability of adequate reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, we expect that our products, if approved, will be priced at a premium over competitive generic products and our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. 
 ASN100 
 There are currently no therapies approved for the prevention of S. aureus pneumonia in high-risk, mechanically ventilated patients. We are aware of two mAb products targeting S. aureus cytotoxin in clinical development, MedImmune’s MEDI4893 and Aridis Pharmaceuticals’ AR301, each of which targets only the cytotoxin Hla and is in Phase 2 clinical development. ASN100 may also compete with mAb products that may be developed to target S. aureus through different mechanisms of action, including XBiotech’s 514G3, which targets S. aureus surface Protein A and is in Phase 2 clinical development, and Genentech’s RG7861, which is comprised of a S. aureus bacterial-surface-targeting mAb attached to an antibiotic and is in Phase 1 clinical development. 
 ASN500 
 If approved for the prevention of RSV infection, ASN500 would compete with palivizumab, which is marketed by MedImmune as Synagis, the only approved therapy in this indication. ASN500 may also compete with other product candidates currently in clinical development in this indication, including MedImmune’s MEDI8897, which is in Phase 2 clinical development. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 In light of our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We have retained worldwide commercial rights for our product candidates. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we plan to commercialize them in the United States and potentially in Europe with our own focused, specialty sales force. We would expect to conduct most of the build-out of this organization following the approval of a biologics license application, or BLA, in the United States or similar marketing authorization in Europe of any of our product candidates. We expect to explore commercialization of ASN100 and potentially other product candidates in certain markets outside the United States, including the European Union, utilizing a variety of collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with one or more third parties. 
Manufacturing 
 We currently contract with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials and intend to do so in the future. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. To meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, third parties with whom we currently work will need to increase their scale of production or we will need to secure alternate suppliers. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with manufacturing experience to oversee our relationships with contract manufacturers. 
 We utilized a single contract manufacturer to produce ASN100 drug product for our completed Phase 1 clinical trial and our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial. We have transitioned to a new contract manufacturer of ASN100 drug product, including the transfer of the manufacturing technology utilized at our prior contract manufacturer. This new contract manufacturer has further developed the manufacturing process and will use this new process to produce ASN100 drug product for our planned Phase 3 clinical trial. While we believe that this new contract manufacturer is capable of producing sufficient quantities of drug product to support our planned Phase 3 clinical trial, there is inherent risk in process development and manufacturing of mAbs utilizing a new process. Should our new contract manufacturer not be able to provide sufficient quantities of drug product for our planned Phase 3 trial, we would be required to seek another contract manufacturer to provide this drug product, likely resulting in a delay in such Phase 3 trial. 
 Our current product candidates are mAbs. Therefore, the manufacturing process involves the genetic engineering of a parental host cell line to isolate a cell that produces the antibody. Once the cell or clone (colony of cells derived from a single cell) is isolated, a cell bank is produced under prescribed and documented conditions. The cell bank, preserved frozen, is tested as required by regulations to demonstrate that the engineered cell line is free from potentially harmful impurities and contaminants, such as viruses. 
 13


The drug substance manufacturing process begins with the thaw of vials from the cell bank and growth of these cells in established media until sufficient cells are cultured to inoculate a production bioreactor. The cells in the production bioreactor are grown in media and under controlled and monitored conditions that stimulate the production of the antibody into the culture media. The production bioreactor is cultured for an established time period and is then harvested by filtration to remove the cells from the culture media. 
 The antibody solution is purified through a number of steps to remove known process- and product-derived impurities. The technologies employed include ultrafiltration and column and membrane chromatography. Additional steps are performed to inactivate or remove viruses. The final step of the drug substance process adjusts the antibody concentration and produces the final formulation to be used for drug product production. The drug substance is tested to meet pre-established criteria for purity, potency and safety, and is then periodically tested to demonstrate stability upon storage as required by regulations. The drug substance is stored at prescribed temperatures, typically refrigerated or frozen. 
 The drug product is produced by sterilization filtration of the drug substance solution, followed by aseptic filling into glass vials and then stoppered. The drug product is subjected to release testing for purity, potency and safety according to pre-established specifications. Drug product lots are periodically tested to demonstrate stability over the established storage expiry period. The drug product is stored and shipped under temperature-controlled conditions, typically refrigerated, to sites designated for clinical trial testing, or eventually to commercial pharmaceutical logistics providers. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and certain non-U.S. patent applications related to our product candidates, proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. We cannot provide any assurance that any patent term extension with respect to any U.S. patent will be obtained and, if obtained, what the duration of such extension may be. 
 Similar provisions are available in the European Union and certain other non-U.S. jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. The expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension or other market exclusivity that may be available to us. However, we cannot provide any assurances that any such patent term extension of a non-U.S. patent will be obtained and, if obtained, the duration of such extension. 
 Trade Secrets 
 In addition to patents, we rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, and obtain and maintain ownership of certain technologies, in part, by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.

Collaboration and License Agreements 
 Adimab, LLC 
 We are developing antibodies discovered by Adimab, LLC, or Adimab, in our ASN100 and ASN500 monoclonal antibody programs. 
 Adimab Collaboration Agreement.    In May 2011, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Adimab, which, as amended, and together with certain applicable option exercise letters we have sent to Adimab, we refer to as the Adimab Collaboration Agreement. We are developing antibodies discovered under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement in our ASN100 monoclonal antibody program. 
 Under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, Adimab and Arsanis were required to use reasonable efforts to conduct certain research, which we funded, to discover and optimize antibodies directed against targets selected by us. Intellectual property arising from the research is generally owned by the party that invents or creates the applicable intellectual property, although certain categories of intellectual property are specifically assigned to one party or the other. For example, patent rights relating to improvements to Adimab’s background platform technology or specifically covering the sequence of an antibody that, in each case, are invented in the course of the research are assigned to Adimab. Prior to our exercise of an option (as described in the next paragraph), (1) we and Adimab each grant the other a non-exclusive license to the relevant intellectual property we own to allow each party to carry out its rights and obligations in connection with the research, and (2) except for Adimab’s retained right to continue using and licensing its own libraries (as described further below), each party agrees not to practice or license the patents arising out of the research that it owns for any purpose other than to carry out its rights and obligations in connection with the research. 
 With respect to each target that was the subject of the research, we had an exclusive option to obtain, with respect to a specified number of antibodies directed against such target and discovered or optimized by Adimab, (1) ownership of certain patent rights relating to such antibodies (including patent rights specifically covering the sequences of such antibodies) and (2) exclusive and non-exclusive licenses, with the right to grant sublicenses, in all human therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic areas, which we refer to as the licensed field, under certain patent rights and know-how (including non-exclusive licenses to certain patent rights and know-how covering or relating to Adimab’s background platform technology), to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import and export such antibodies and products based on such antibodies (but not for antibody discovery purposes). In addition, upon exercise of each option, certain contractual restrictions on our ability to prosecute, practice and license certain patents owned by us that arose out of the research were eliminated. All of our options under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement have expired, or are in the process of being exercised, or, with respect to multiple targets and hundreds of antibodies, have already been exercised. The assigned and exclusively and non-exclusively licensed patent rights resulting from these option exercises are described in more detail above under “ —Intellectual Property.” 
 Under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, for each target for which we have exercised an option, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product in major markets. If we do not fulfill these diligence obligations, Adimab may consider it a material breach, allowing Adimab to terminate the Adimab Collaboration Agreement with respect to such target and all associated products. 
 Regardless of the assignments and licenses granted by Adimab under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, Adimab is not required to remove any antibodies from its libraries or to restrict itself from either adding any antibodies to its libraries or providing those libraries to third parties (even if those libraries contain antibodies for which we have exercised an option). Adimab may also freely disclose to third parties certain information (including information received from us) regarding certain attributes of the antibodies discovered or optimized under the research program. Accordingly, Adimab retains a non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable right under certain patents created under the research program to transfer to third parties’ libraries that may include antibodies discovered under the research program (including antibodies for which we have exercised our option) and to conduct any activity with respect to antibodies for which we do not exercise our option. 
 Under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, as of December 31, 2017, we had paid Adimab approximately $4.3 million in the aggregate, consisting of upfront payments and reimbursement for research conducted by Adimab. We are obligated to pay Adimab royalties at a mid-single-digit percentage of net sales, made by us or our affiliates, of products based on antibodies for which we have exercised our option, or products that use or are based on any antibody discovered or optimized under the agreement, any derivative or modified version of any such antibody, or any sequence information as to any such antibody. 
 If we (or one of our affiliates with rights under the agreement) undergo a change in control and, at the time of such change in control, we have not sold or licensed to third parties all of our rights in antibodies for which we are obligated to pay Adimab royalties under the agreement (which rights we refer to as undesignated rights), then we are obligated to either pay Adimab a percentage, in the mid double digits of the payments we receive from that change in control that are reasonably attributable to those undesignated rights 
 16


and certain patents arising from the collaboration, or require our acquirer and all of its future third party collaborators to pay to Adimab the royalties described in the preceding paragraphs with respect to net sales of all products based on those undesignated rights. If we grant rights to a third party under certain patents that are not directed to the antibodies for which we are obligated to pay Adimab royalties (as described above), we are also obligated to pay Adimab, in place of royalties or a percentage of payments received from the third party, a lump sum in the high six digits. 
 If we sell or license to any third party, or otherwise grant rights to any third party to, any of the products for which we are obligated to pay Adimab royalties (as described above), either alone or as part of a package including specified patents not directed to these antibodies, we are obligated to pay Adimab either the same royalties on net sales of such products by such third party, or a percentage, ranging from the low double digits to a maximum of less than 30%, of the payments we receive from such third parties that are attributable to such grant of rights. In April 2017, we entered into a letter agreement with the Gates Foundation (described in more detail below), pursuant to which we licensed to the Gates Foundation certain rights under our ASN100 program. 
 Notwithstanding the payment obligations described in the preceding paragraphs, we have no payment obligations under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement with respect to sales of certain antibody products if they are sold at cost in developing countries under our April 2017 letter agreement with the Gates Foundation. However, if such products are sold in developing countries for an amount that exceeds cost, then the amount of such excess over cost will be subject to the royalty payment obligations described above. 
 Under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, each party generally controls the prosecution and maintenance of the intellectual property it owns, but we control the prosecution and maintenance of patents covering antibodies for which we have exercised our option (except to the extent that such patents cover Adimab’s background platform technology or any improvements to that technology), which we refer to as the antibody patents, regardless of which party owns those patents. After we exercise an option, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct such prosecution and maintenance, including by filing and maintaining, in the major markets and all other countries where it is commercially reasonable to do so, at least one patent directed to the antibodies for which we have exercised our option, and must collaborate with Adimab with respect to such prosecution and maintenance. We have the first right to enforce the antibody patents against infringers in the licensed field, though our right to settle such infringement cases is limited. 
 If we or any of our affiliates challenges the validity, enforceability or scope of any of the licensed patents, then our payment obligations under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement increase, Adimab obtains the right to prosecute, maintain and enforce all of the exclusively licensed patents, and we must reimburse Adimab for its legal costs in connection with such challenge. 
 Under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, we are solely responsible for searching for, identifying and evaluating any third party intellectual property that may be infringed or misappropriated by any antibody discovered or optimized under the agreement, or any derivative or modified version of such an antibody, and must indemnify Adimab for any third party claims arising from any such infringement or misappropriation. 
 The Adimab Collaboration Agreement will expire on a country-by-country basis twelve years after the first commercial sale in such country of the last product for which we are obligated to pay Adimab royalties in such country under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement. We have the right to terminate the Adimab Collaboration Agreement for any reason by providing Adimab with a specified amount of prior written notice. Adimab has the right to terminate the Adimab Collaboration Agreement if we materially breach the agreement and fail to cure such breach within a specified cure period, including, as discussed above, for our failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product directed at a target for we have exercised an option in major markets. If Adimab terminates the Adimab Collaboration Agreement for our breach, or if we terminate the agreement for our convenience, then we must transfer or license to Adimab certain rights and assets relating to targets and antibodies for which we exercised our option. Adimab is then obligated to make payments to us with respect to these targets and antibodies that are similar to the payments we were required to make to Adimab during the term of the agreement. Certain of our payment obligations relating to specified products and patents arising from the agreement survive expiration or termination of the agreement. 
 Certain disputes under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement must be resolved through binding arbitration. 
 Adimab Option and License Agreement.    In February 2017, we entered into an option and license agreement with Adimab, which we refer to as the Adimab Option Agreement. We are developing antibodies discovered under the Adimab Option and License Agreement in our ASN500 monoclonal antibody program. 
 Under the Adimab Option Agreement, Adimab has provided to us certain proprietary antibodies against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, which we refer to as the initial RSV antibodies, for our evaluation during a specified option period and has granted us an exclusive, non-sublicensable license under certain Adimab patent rights and know-how during the option period to create, research, 
 17


optimize, make, have made and use the initial RSV antibodies and modified or derivative forms of the initial RSV antibodies. Adimab has performed affinity maturation of a limited number of the initial RSV antibodies for us and provided us with a specified number of higher-affinity RSV antibodies resulting from those activities. In addition, we are conducting our own research program with respect to these RSV antibodies. 
 Under the Adimab Option Agreement, we have an exclusive option, exercisable during the option period upon payment of an option fee to Adimab, to require Adimab to assign to us all rights in up to a specified number of RSV antibodies selected by us, which we refer to as the selected RSV antibodies, and certain patent rights owned by Adimab that cover these antibodies, and to obtain from Adimab a non-exclusive license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under certain other patent rights and know-how owned by Adimab, to research, develop, have developed, make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import and export products based on the selected RSV antibodies and modified or derivative forms of the selected RSV antibodies, for all indications and uses except for certain diagnostic uses. This license would not include any right or license to use the licensed patent rights or know-how to discover or optimize antibodies. We have agreed not to use the patent rights or know-how assigned or licensed to us for the purpose of researching, developing, manufacturing or commercializing RSV antibodies that are not licensed by us. 
 If we exercise our option under the Adimab Option Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product based on a licensed RSV antibody in major markets. If we materially breach these diligence obligations, Adimab will have the right to terminate the Adimab Option Agreement. 
 Under the Adimab Option Agreement, regardless of the assignments and licenses granted by Adimab, Adimab is not required to remove any antibodies from its libraries or to restrict itself from either adding any antibodies to its libraries or providing those libraries to third parties (even if those libraries include RSV antibodies that have been licensed or assigned to us). Under the Adimab Option Agreement, Adimab may also freely disclose to third parties certain information regarding certain attributes of the initial RSV antibodies and modified or derivative forms of the initial RSV antibodies created by Adimab (but not modified or derivative forms created by us). However, Adimab and its affiliates may not provide any third party any isolated RSV antibody that has been licensed or assigned to us or grant any third party any license under any patent to the extent it covers any such antibody. If any third party receives a library containing an RSV antibody that has been licensed or assigned to us and requests intellectual property rights, nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, or additional physical materials with respect to such antibody, Adimab must inform such third party that it cannot grant such rights or provide such information or materials. 
 Under the Adimab Option Agreement, as of December 31, 2017, we had incurred costs paid or payable to Adimab of approximately $0.1 million in the aggregate, consisting of reimbursement for affinity maturation work performed by Adimab and for certain patent prosecution costs incurred by Adimab. If we wish to exercise our option under the Adimab Option Agreement, we are obligated to pay Adimab an option fee of $0.3 million and make clinical and regulatory milestone payments of up to $24.4 million. We are obligated to pay Adimab royalties at a mid-single-digit percentage of net sales of products based on the initial RSV antibodies (including modified or derivative forms of those antibodies created by or for Arsanis) by us or any of our affiliates, licensees or sublicensees, regardless of whether these products practice any of the assigned or licensed patents or know-how. If we obtain a license under a third party’s patent in order to avoid potential claims of patent infringement based on the way in which Adimab discovered an initial RSV antibody or a modified or derivative form of an initial RSV antibody using Adimab’s platform technology, then we have the right to offset a portion of the royalties we pay to the third party against our royalty payment obligations to Adimab with respect to such antibody, subject to certain limitations. If we obtain a license under any third-party patent other than as described in the preceding sentence, we have no right to offset any portion of the royalties we pay to the third party against our royalty payment obligations to Adimab. If there is a specified level of biosimilar competition with respect to any product on which we are obligated to pay Adimab running royalties, the royalties owed to Adimab will be reduced with respect to such product, subject to certain limitations. 
 Notwithstanding the royalty payment obligations described in the preceding paragraph, we have no payment obligations under the Adimab Option Agreement with respect to sales of products based on licensed RSV antibodies to the extent they are sold at cost in developing countries under the February 2017 grant agreement with the Gates Foundation (which is described in further detail below). However, if such products are sold in developing countries for an amount that exceeds cost, then the amount of such excess will be subject to the royalty payment obligations described in the preceding paragraph. 
 After exercising our option under the Adimab Option Agreement, we control prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and defense of the assigned patents (with obligations to collaborate with Adimab on such prosecution and maintenance) at our cost, and Adimab controls prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and defense of the licensed patents at its cost. 
 Under the Adimab Option Agreement, we are solely responsible for searching for, identifying and evaluating any third party intellectual property that may be infringed or misappropriated by any licensed RSV antibody, or any derivative or modified version of such an antibody, and must indemnify Adimab for any third party claims arising from any such infringement or misappropriation. 
 18


If we do not exercise our option, the Adimab Option Agreement will expire on our achievement of specified preclinical milestones under our grant agreement with the Gates Foundation, but in any event no later than mid-2019. If we do exercise our option, the Adimab Option Agreement will expire on the last-to-expire royalty term (defined, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, as the period ending on the later of twelve years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country and the expiration of the last of a specified set of patents and patent applications covering such product in such country) for any and all products for which we are obligated to pay Adimab royalties under the Adimab Option Agreement. We have the right to terminate the Adimab Option Agreement for any reason by providing Adimab with a specified amount of prior written notice. Adimab has the right to terminate the Adimab Option Agreement if we materially breach the agreement and fail to cure such breach within a specified cure period, including, as discussed above, for our failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product based on a licensed RSV antibody in major markets. If Adimab terminates the Adimab Option Agreement for our breach, if we terminate the agreement for our convenience or if the agreement expires before we exercise our option, then we must return or destroy certain know-how, including all initial RSV antibodies, and all modified or derivative forms of those antibodies, in our possession other than those for which we have made all payments required under the Adimab Option Agreement, assign certain patents covering certain RSV antibodies to Adimab, grant Adimab a non-exclusive, royalty-free license under certain other patents, and grant Adimab a time-limited right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive license to certain patents and know-how and the transfer and assignment of certain regulatory filings and approvals and other related assets related to products based on licensed RSV antibodies. Certain of our payment obligations relating to specified products arising from the agreement survive expiration or termination of the agreement. 
 Certain disputes under the Adimab Option Agreement must be resolved through binding arbitration. 
 The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation 
 Gates Foundation Grant Agreement.    In February 2017, we entered into a grant agreement with the Gates Foundation pursuant to which the Gates Foundation granted us up to $9.3 million to conduct preclinical development of monoclonal antibodies for the prevention of RSV infection in newborns, which we refer to as the RSV project. In return, we have agreed to conduct the RSV project in a manner that ensures that the knowledge and information gained from the project will be promptly and broadly disseminated, and that the products, technologies, materials, processes and other intellectual property resulting from the RSV project (which we collectively refer to as the funded developments) will be made available and accessible at an affordable price to people most in need within developing countries. These obligations survive any expiration or termination of the grant agreement. 
 To this end, we have granted the Gates Foundation a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid up, sublicensable license to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, distribute, copy, modify, create derivative works, publicly perform and display the funded developments and, to the extent incorporated into a funded development or required to use a funded development, any other technology created outside of the RSV project that was used as part of the RSV project, for the benefit of people in developing countries. We have also agreed to seek prompt publication of data and results developed under the RSV project under “open access” terms and conditions. This license and these publication obligations survive any expiration or termination of the grant agreement. 
 The grant agreement expires on October 31, 2019. The Gates Foundation can modify, suspend or discontinue any payment under the grant agreement, or terminate the grant agreement, if it is not reasonably satisfied with our progress on the RSV project; if there are significant changes to our leadership or other factors that the Gates Foundation reasonably believes may threaten the RSV project’s success; if we undergo a change in control; if there is a change in our tax status; if the RSV project is no longer aligned with the Gates Foundation’s programmatic strategy; or if we fail to comply with the grant agreement. Any grant funds that have not been used for, or committed to, the RSV project upon the expiration or termination of the agreement must be returned to the Gates Foundation or otherwise used as directed by the Gates Foundation. 
 Gates Foundation Letter Agreement and Investment.    In April 2017, we entered into a letter agreement with the Gates Foundation. In connection with the letter agreement, the Gates Foundation purchased $8.0 million of shares of our Series D convertible preferred stock as a program-related investment, and we committed to use the proceeds from the investment by the Gates Foundation solely to advance the development of a specified monoclonal antibody program, which we refer to as the funded program, that involves the monoclonal antibodies ASN-1, ASN-2 and ASN-3 and our product candidate ASN100. The Gates Foundation’s primary objective in making the investment was to further the accomplishment of its charitable purposes, including the relief of the poor, distressed and underprivileged, the advancement of science, and the promotion of health by supporting the development of low-cost drugs to address diseases that have a disproportionate impact on people within developing countries, and to ensure that the knowledge gained using the Gates Foundation’s funding is promptly and broadly disseminated and the products developed with such funding are made available and accessible at affordable prices to people most in need within developing countries. We refer to the specific obligations that we assumed in the letter agreement that are intended to further this objective as our global access commitments. 
 19


We have agreed to diligently generate and test, in preclinical animal studies, a product candidate for the prevention of neonatal sepsis caused by S. aureus in accordance with an agreed-upon research program. The Gates Foundation has a right to continue funding to develop and launch a final product for the prevention of neonatal sepsis caused by S. aureus, and/or to develop a combination monoclonal antibody product for use in the prevention of neonatal sepsis caused by S. aureus and/or other bacterial pathogens. We refer to each of these programs as a funded project. In each case, the Gates Foundation may elect to provide further funding and may request that the further development be co-funded by additional equity investments, subject to requisite approval by our board of directors and/or stockholders, or grants from the Gates Foundation pursuant to its standard grant making terms and processes. The specific level and allocation of any such funding responsibilities will be mutually agreed with the Gates Foundation to fairly allocate expected benefits between developing countries and developed countries in a manner that would not be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or operations. Such funding will create an obligation for us, alone or through a third party, to conduct such research, development and launch activities. At the request of the Gates Foundation, we will grant the Gates Foundation a non-exclusive, sublicensable license to any candidates or products developed under any of these programs, and all related technology necessary for the development, production and/or distribution or sale of the relevant product(s), for use in the prevention of neonatal sepsis caused by S. aureus and/or other bacterial pathogens. The Gates Foundation would only be permitted to exercise any license to our background intellectual property under specified circumstances, which we collectively call a charitability default, or in the event of any other specified triggering event. A charitability default would occur in the event of our material breach of any of our global access commitments under the letter agreement (other than for regulatory, technical or scientific failure not within our reasonable control or knowledge prior to the letter agreement), our failure to comply with the restrictions on our use of the proceeds from the Gates Foundation investment, or our failure to comply with any related U.S. legal obligations set forth in the letter agreement. Other triggering events that would allow the Gates Foundation to exercise the license to our background intellectual property include if we commit an uncured material breach of any grant agreement for any applicable funded project; if we are unwilling or unable or cease to promptly conduct or complete any of the programs described above in this paragraph; if the Gates Foundation reasonably determines (after good faith discussions with us) that we do not have the ability to conduct or complete our global access commitments under the letter agreement in any material respect; or if we become insolvent or cease to conduct business in the ordinary course. Any exercise by the Gates Foundation of the license described in this paragraph will be subject to payment of applicable royalties under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement and, in certain circumstances, may involve payment of a reasonable royalty to us on sales of applicable products outside of the developing countries. 
 Under the letter agreement, we have also agreed to conduct up to two additional projects proposed and funded by the Gates Foundation, or a Gates Foundation-supported entity, under the Gates Foundation’s standard grant making terms and processes, to identify monoclonal antibody candidates against a target pathogen or antigens associated with a target pathogen, and potentially to further develop such candidates, each of which we refer to as an additional funded project. At the request of the Gates Foundation, such additional funded projects will include a non-exclusive, sublicensable license to the Gates Foundation to any product candidates and related technology resulting from the applicable program, to the extent necessary for the development, production or distribution or sale of the relevant product candidate within the field of use prescribed for such product candidate. The Gates Foundation will not practice any such license for sale or distribution of any product candidate outside of the developing countries unless we or one of our licensees commits a material breach of our global access commitments under the letter agreement. If the Gates Foundation requests that we continue the development of any candidate identified in one of these additional funded projects, the specific level and allocation of any funding responsibilities associated with such development will be mutually agreed with the Gates Foundation to fairly allocate expected benefits between developing countries and developed countries in a manner that would not be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or operations. 
 In addition to the licenses described above, we have granted to the Gates Foundation and/or Gates Foundation-supported entities, a non-exclusive, non-terminable, royalty-free (except as required under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement), sublicensable license to products, technologies, materials, processes and other intellectual property developed using funds provided by the Gates Foundation or a Gates Foundation-supported entity, or developed in connection with our conduct of any funded project or additional funded project, as well as all of our background intellectual property, to utilize and exploit products and services directed at pathogens or other targets subject to any funded project or additional funded project. As with the other license grants in the letter agreement, the Gates Foundation would only be able to exercise this license if there is a charitability default or other triggering event (as described above). 
 We are required to obtain and maintain all necessary rights and licenses needed to perform our global access commitments under the letter agreement, and we are required to use reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary licenses in order to enable completion of all applicable products in accordance with such global access commitments. The Gates Foundation will be responsible for costs payable to third parties for such licenses to the extent they are necessary for products in developing countries, provided that the Gates Foundation has consented to the terms of the applicable license and the applicable license agreements meet certain specified requirements. 
 20


We are required to work with the Gates Foundation to develop and execute, prior to the completion of our Phase 2 clinical trials with respect to our ASN100 product candidate, a manufacturing and supply plan that will meet the reasonably expected demand in developing countries for any products developed under any funded project or any additional funded project. We have agreed that the price of such products in developing countries will be such that the products are affordable to low income individuals, and in no case will the price charged by us with respect to such products in such countries exceed our actual production costs plus a specified percentage. The manufacturing and supply plan could involve the use of manufacturing partners and support from donors, and the specific level and allocation of funding responsibilities will be mutually agreed based on a fair allocation of the expected benefits between developing countries and developed countries. 
 If the Gates Foundation determines that it is reasonably necessary to work with a third-party manufacturer to achieve certain specified price and volume commitments, we have agreed to license and transfer the necessary technology and intellectual property to such a manufacturer in order to allow the production of products for developing countries, and the Gates Foundation will pay all reasonable costs for any such transfer. 
 We are required to publish, in accordance with certain “open access” terms and conditions, results and information developed under any funded project or additional funded project within a reasonable period of time subject to delays and limitations necessary to protect our intellectual property and to third party confidentiality obligations, provide the Gates Foundation with access to data and information regarding such projects and the reasonably contemplated use of our platform technology for the programs under the letter agreement, and provide the Gates Foundation certain rights to share such data and information with third parties. 
 The term of the letter agreement continues in perpetuity. However, the Gates Foundation has a right to withdraw from its investment in us if there is a charitability default (as described above). If we do not cure the charitability default within a specified period of time, we have the obligation to redeem the Gates Foundation’s stock, to the extent consistent with applicable law and so long as it does not render us insolvent, or to locate a purchaser of the Gates Foundation’s stock. If we are not able to redeem or find a purchaser of the Gates Foundation’s stock, we must use our best efforts to effect the Gates Foundation’s withdrawal right as soon as practicable. During any period when we are unable to effect the withdrawal right, we may not pay dividends on any of our stock, redeem the capital stock of any other stockholder (other than certain circumstances for employees or contractors) or otherwise make any distribution to any other stockholder (other than as part of a stock option plan). For any redemption or purchase resulting from a charitability default, the Gates Foundation’s stock will be valued at the greater of the original purchase price (plus specified interest) or the fair market value of such stock. 
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of biopharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 Licensure and Regulation of Biologics in the United States 
 In the United States, mAb products are licensed by the FDA as biological products, or biologics, under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and applicable implementing regulations and guidance. The failure of an applicant to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, including non-clinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process or post-approval process, may result in delays to the conduct of a study, regulatory review and approval and/or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions may include, but are not limited to, the FDA’s refusal to allow an applicant to proceed with clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, adverse publicity, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines and civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA or Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other government entities, including state agencies. 
 21


An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps before the product candidate will be licensed by the FDA: 
  
• | preclinical testing including laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, which must be performed in accordance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations and standards;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA for a biologic product which includes not only the results of the clinical trials, but also, detailed information on the chemistry, manufacture and quality controls for the product candidate and proposed labelling for one or more proposed indication(s);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product candidate or components thereof are manufactured to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of clinical data in support of the BLA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA licensure of the BLA to allow marketing of the new biologic product; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct any post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical Studies and Investigational New Drug Application.    Before an applicant begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as other studies to evaluate, among other things, the toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations and standards. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 The IND and IRB Processes.    An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved BLA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. 
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed. 
 22


A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, on April 28, 2008, the FDA amended its regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application as support for an IND or a new drug application. The final rule provides that such studies must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies. 
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
 Information about clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of a BLA.    Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator in accordance with GCP requirements which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written clinical trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may also be required after approval. 
 Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients. During Phase 1 clinical trials, information about the investigational biological product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase 1 clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80. 
 Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 clinical trials are well controlled, closely monitored and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants. 
 Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 clinical trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a biologic: such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.” Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. 
 23


In cases where two or more FDA-regulated products are combined to form a single product candidate, that product candidate is called a combination product and must be developed in compliance with regulations that apply to combination products. An example of a combination product is two biologics combined as a fixed-dose combination product candidate, where the safety and efficacy of each component may need to be demonstrated in addition to the safety and efficacy of the combination product. Data to support combination product development and approval may include results from preclinical tests, clinical trials, and chemistry, manufacturing and controls. 
 In some cases, the FDA may approve a BLA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of a larger number of patients in the intended treatment group and to further document a clinical benefit in the case of biologics approved under accelerated approval regulations. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 Review and Approval of a BLA.    In order to obtain approval to market a biological product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides sufficient data establishing the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biological product for its intended indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the biological product to the satisfaction of the FDA. 
 The BLA is, thus, a vehicle through which applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new product for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. Every new biologic product candidate must be the subject of an approved BLA before it may be commercialized in the United States. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2018 is $2,421,495 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to a program fee, which for fiscal year 2018 is $304,162. These fees are typically increased annually. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.
 Following submission of a BLA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of the application generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of BLAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within 10 months from the date on which the FDA accepts the application for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of products that are not NMEs, the 10-month and six-month review periods run from the date that the FDA receives the application. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
 Before approving an application, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Moreover, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with a BLA submission, including component manufacturing, finished product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing 
 24


processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain applications, including applications for products in shortage or those for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report. 
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations.    The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review designation and regenerative advanced therapy designation. 
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from 10 months to six months. 
 With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. 
 25


Accelerated Approval Pathway.    The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. Thus, the benefit of accelerated approval derives from the potential to receive approval based on surrogate endpoints sooner than possible for trials with clinical or survival endpoints, rather than deriving from any explicit shortening of the FDA approval timeline, as is the case with priority review. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to initiate expedited proceedings to withdraw approval of the product. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 Limited Population Antibacterial Drug Pathway.    With passage of the CURES Act in December 2016, Congress authorized FDA to approve an antibacterial or antifungal product, alone or in combination with one or more other products, as a “limited population drug.” To qualify for this approval pathway, the product must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening infection in a limited population of patients with unmet needs; the standards for approval of drugs and biologics under the FDCA and PHSA must be satisfied; and FDA must receive a written request from the sponsor to approve the product as a limited population drug pursuant to this provision. The FDA’s determination of safety and effectiveness for such a product must reflect the benefit-risk profile of such drug in the intended limited population, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the infection the drug is intended to treat and the availability or lack of alternative treatment in such a limited population. 
 Any drug or biologic approved under this pathway must be labeled with the statement “Limited Population” in a prominent manner and adjacent to the proprietary name of the drug or biological product. The prescribing information must also state that the product is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients and copies of all promotional materials relating to the product must be submitted to FDA at least 30 days prior to dissemination of the materials. If FDA subsequently approves the product for a broader indication, the agency may remove any post-marketing conditions, including requirements with respect to labeling and review of promotional materials applicable to the product. Nothing in this pathway to approval of a limited population drug prevents sponsors of such products from seeking designation or approval under other provisions of the FDCA, such as accelerated approval. 
 The FDA’s Decision on a BLA.    On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 26


If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Post-Approval Regulation.    If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any post-approval requirements that the FDA may have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and manufacturing problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements. 
 A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates the 
marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug 
products placed on the market. 
This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a product’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before 
the product 
is approved. After licensure, a product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In the United States, health care professionals are generally permitted to prescribe products for such uses not 
described in the product’s labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, 
prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. 
 If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant 
 27


commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. 
 Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity.    Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, a BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
 For products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, the FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors, and the FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than 90 days after the FDA’s receipt of the study plan.
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
 The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 established new requirements to govern certain molecularly targeted cancer indications. Any company that submits a BLA three years after the date of enactment of that statute must submit pediatric assessments with the BLA if the biologic is intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. The investigation must be designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data regarding the dosing, safety and preliminary efficacy to inform pediatric labeling for the product. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity.    Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a biologic product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must seek orphan drug designation before submitting a BLA for the candidate product. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee. 
 If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing 
 28


application for the same product for the same condition for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same biologic for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. 
Orphan exclusivity also does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different conditions. If a biologic designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity.    The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. As of January 1, 2018, the FDA has approved nine biosimilar products for use in the United States. No interchangeable biosimilars, however, have been approved. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Additional guidances are expected to be finalized by FDA in the near term. 
 Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension.    A patent claiming a new biologic product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 
Healthcare Law and Regulation 
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of biologic products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 29


 
• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing •or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-government third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Review and Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the European Union. 
 Clinical Trial Approval.    The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted. The Regulation is anticipated to enter into force in 2019. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the European Union will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which on-going clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. 
 30


The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. 
 PRIME Designation in the EU.  In March 2016, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist.  The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure.  Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies.  Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted.  Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, or the Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level.  A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
 Marketing Authorization.    To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EU Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Paediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association, or EFTA, States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. 
 Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. At the end of this period, the CHMP provides a scientific opinion on whether or not a marketing authorization should be granted in relation to a medicinal product. Within 15 calendar days of receipt of a final opinion from the CHMP, the European Commission must prepare a draft decision concerning an application for marketing authorization. This draft decision must take the opinion and any relevant provisions of EU law into account. Before arriving at a final decision on an application for centralized authorization of a medicinal product the European Commission must consult the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use. The Standing Committee is composed of representatives of the EU Member States and chaired by a non-voting European Commission representative. The European Parliament also has a related “droit de regard.” The European Parliament’s role is to ensure that the European Commission has not exceeded its powers in deciding to grant or refuse to grant a marketing authorization. 
 31


Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. 
 The mutual recognition procedure similarly is based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State. 
 Regulatory Data Protection in the European Union.    In the European Union, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Directive 2001/83/EC. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 repeats this entitlement for medicinal products authorized in accordance the centralized authorization procedure. Data exclusivity prevents applicants for authorization of generics of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for a period of eight years. During an additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be placed on the European Union market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall 10-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. 
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals.    A marketing authorization has an initial validity for five years in principle. The marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU Member State. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the EU Member States may decide, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five year period of marketing authorization. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the European Union market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing EU Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity.    Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provides that a drug can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
 Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and in addition a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the 10 year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.

Regulatory Requirements after a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained.    In case an authorization for a medicinal product in the European Union is obtained, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include: 
  
• | Compliance with the European Union’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable European Union laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with European Union cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the European Union with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the European Union.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union notably under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended, and EU Member State laws.

 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom.    On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the United Kingdom provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the E.U. Treaty. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom. covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom.  
 Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage and Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the insurance coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure insurance coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide insurance coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of insurance coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable insurance coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting insurance coverage and reimbursement for drugs and biologics and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government healthcare programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidates are: 
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, then-President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, reform government program reimbursement methodologies. 
 These healthcare reforms, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted 
in the 
future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price for any approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product. Reductions in reimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices or the frequency with which products are prescribed or administered.  Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Since enactment 
of the ACA
, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law.  In May 
2017, the U.S. House of Representatives passed 
legislation known as 
the American Health Care Act 
of 2017. Thereafter
, the Senate 
Republicans introduced and then updated a bill to replace the ACA known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017. The Senate Republicans also introduced legislation to repeal the ACA without companion legislation to replace it, and a “skinny” version of the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017
.  In addition, the Senate considered proposed healthcare reform legislation known as the Graham-Cassidy bill.  None of these measures was passed by the U.S. Senate.

The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA. In January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices.  In October 2017, the President signed a second Executive Order allowing for the use of association health plans and short-term health insurance, which may provide fewer health benefits than the plans sold through the ACA exchanges.  At the same time, the Administration announced that it will discontinue the payment of cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments to insurance companies until Congress approves the appropriation of funds for such CSR payments. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the ACA.  A bipartisan bill to appropriate funds for CSR payments was introduced in the Senate, but the future of that bill is uncertain.
 More recently, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by the President on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.”  The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, will become effective in 2019.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise. Further, each chamber of Congress has put forth multiple bills designed to repeal or repeal and replace portions 
of the ACA. Although none of these measures has been enacted by Congress to date, Congress may consider other legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA. Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA during the next Congressional session.
 Individual states 
in the 
United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions 
on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing.
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization. 
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.

Scientific and Clinical Advisory Boards 
 We have established a scientific advisory board and a clinical advisory board and we regularly seek advice and input from these leading scientists and physicians on matters related to our research and development programs. The members of our advisory boards consist of experts across a range of key disciplines relevant to our programs. Our advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. In addition, our advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete with ours. All of our advisors are affiliated with other entities and devote only a small portion of their time to us. 
 The members of our advisory boards are generally compensated for their services in cash, at a fixed hourly or daily rate. In addition, our board of directors has agreed on a case-by-case basis to award certain members of our scientific advisory board with grants of cash, restricted stock or stock options in connection with the commencement of their service. In the case of restricted stock or stock options, such awards typically vest over four years, with 25% of the shares underlying the award vesting on the first anniversary of the grant date and an additional 1/48th of the original number of shares underlying the award vesting monthly thereafter. 
 The current members of our scientific advisory board are:
