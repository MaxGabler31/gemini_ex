ITEM 1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW



Rubicon Technology, Inc. (“Rubicon” or the “Company”) currently consists of one operating subsidiary, Rubicon Technology Worldwide LLC (“RTW”). In June 2021 the operations of Rubicon DTP LLC (“Direct Dose” or DDRX”) were discontinued.



RTW is an advanced materials provider specializing in monocrystalline sapphire for applications in optical and industrial systems. Sapphire is a desirable material for high-performance applications due to its hardness and strength, transparency in the visible and infrared spectrum, thermal conductivity, thermal shock resistance, abrasion resistance, high melting point and chemical inertness. As a result, it is ideally suited for extreme environments in a range of industries where material durability is just as important as optical clarity. We believe that we continue to have a reputation as one of the highest quality sapphire sources in the market. We provide optical and industrial sapphire products in a variety of shapes and sizes, including round and rectangular windows, blanks, domes, tubes and rods.



Historically, we have also provided sapphire products to the LED and mobile device markets, which are the largest markets for sapphire. However, given competitive pressures in those markets, in the fourth quarter of 2016 we announced our decision to focus on the optical and industrial sapphire markets and exit the LED market. Following this decision, we closed our Malaysia facility and scaled down and consolidated our remaining operations in the U.S. In the succeeding years we have completed individual sales and held auctions for assets located in Malaysia and at each of our U.S. properties, resulting in the sale of certain of our excess equipment and consumable assets. In December 2019 we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell our manufacturing facility located in Malaysia and it was completed in June 2020. In December 2020, Rubicon sold all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of its wholly owned subsidiary Rubicon Sapphire Technology (Malaysia) SDN BHD.



We manage our operations and ship from our owned facility located in Bensenville, Illinois.



Our sapphire business operates in a very competitive market. Our ability to expand our optical and industrial business and the acceptance of new product offerings are difficult to predict. Our total sales backlog was approximately $1,735,000 and $747,000 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 



In June 2021 the operations of Direct Dose Rx were discontinued. The costs associated with such closure were not material. Direct Dose Rx was a specialized pharmacy that provided prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs and vitamins to patients being discharged from skilled nursing facilities and hospitals and directly to retail customers who want such medications delivered to their home. The delivered products were sorted by the dose, date and time to be taken and come in easy to use perforated strip-packaging as opposed to separate pill bottles. Direct Dose Rx was licensed to operate in 11 states. The services offered by Direct Dose Rx benefited patients, skilled nursing facilities and hospitals by reducing the risk of hospital readmissions.



Rubicon is actively evaluating the acquisition of profitable companies in order to utilize our substantial net operating loss (“NOL”) tax carryforwards.



Rubicon Technology, Inc. is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated on February 7, 2001. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbol “RBCN.”



Sapphire INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 



Sapphire is utilized in optical and industrial applications. It is used for windows and optics for aerospace, sensor, medical, semiconductor, instrumentation, electronics and laser applications due to its wide-band transmission, superior strength, chemical and scratch resistance and high strength-to-weight ratio. 
PRODUCTS 



 We provide optical and industrial sapphire products in various shapes and sizes, including round and rectangular windows and blanks, domes, tubes and rods. These optical sapphire products are qualified and used in equipment for a wide variety of end markets and high performance applications, including defense and aerospace, specialty lighting, instrumentation, sensors and detectors, semiconductor process equipment, electronic substrates, medical and laser applications.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 



In 2021 and 2020, Rubicon did not incur any research and development (“R&D”) expenses and it currently does not have any plans for expenditures in 2022 related to R&D.

SALES AND MARKETING 



We market and sell through our direct sales force to customers. Our direct sales team includes experienced and technically sophisticated sales professionals and engineers who are knowledgeable in the development, manufacturing and use of sapphire windows and other optical materials.



A key component of our marketing strategy is developing and maintaining strong relationships with our customers. We achieve this by working closely with our customers to optimize our products for their production processes. We believe that maintaining close relationships with our customers’ senior management and providing technical support improves customer satisfaction.



CUSTOMERS 



Our principal customers have been defense subcontractors, industrial manufacturers, fabricators and resellers. A substantial portion of our sales have been to a small number of customers. In 2021, our top three customers (each 10% or greater of our revenues) accounted for, in the aggregate, approximately 46% of our revenue from our continuing operations and in 2020, the top four customers accounted for approximately 55% of our revenue from our continuing operations. Although we are attempting to diversify and expand our customer base, we expect our sales to continue to be concentrated among a small number of customers. However, we also expect that our significant customers may change from time to time. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our sapphire revenues during 2021 or 2020 other than those referred to above.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 



We rely primarily upon a combination of know-how, patents, trade secret laws and non-disclosure agreements with employees, customers and potential customers to protect our intellectual property. However, we believe that factors such as the technological and innovative abilities of our personnel, the success of our ongoing product development efforts and our efforts to maintain trade secret protection are more important than patents in maintaining our competitive position.
COMPETITION 



The markets for high-quality sapphire products are very competitive and have been characterized by rapid technological change. The products we sell must meet certain demanding requirements to succeed in the marketplace. Although we are a well-established sapphire provider, we face significant competition from other established providers of similar products as well as from new and potential entrants into our markets.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION 



In our manufacturing process, we use water, oils, slurries, acids, adhesives and other industrial chemicals. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of these materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These include statutory and regulatory provisions under which we are responsible for the management of hazardous materials we use and the disposition of hazardous wastes resulting from our manufacturing processes. Failure to comply with such provisions, whether intentional or inadvertent, could result in fines and other liabilities to the government or third parties, injunctions requiring us to suspend or curtail operations or other remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The cost of complying with environmental regulation is not material. 
EMPLOYEES 



As of December 31, 2021, we had 13 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relations to be good.
