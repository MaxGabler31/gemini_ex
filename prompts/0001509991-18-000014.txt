Item 1.  Business
General
Kosmos is a leading independent oil and gas exploration and production company focused on frontier and emerging areas along the Atlantic Margins. Our assets include existing production and development projects offshore Ghana and Equatorial Guinea, large discoveries and significant further exploration potential offshore Mauritania and Senegal, as well as exploration licenses offshore Cote d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Morocco, Sao Tome and Principe, and Suriname. Kosmos is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and London Stock Exchange ("LSE") and is traded under the ticker symbol KOS.
Kosmos was founded in 2003 to find oil in under‑explored or overlooked parts of West Africa. Members of the management team—who had previously worked together making significant discoveries and developing them in Africa, the Gulf of Mexico, and other areas—established the company on a single geologic concept that previously had been disregarded by others in the industry, the Late Cretaceous play system.
Following our formation, we acquired multiple exploration licenses and proved the geologic concept with the discovery of the Jubilee Field within the Tano Basin in the deep waters offshore Ghana in 2007. This was the first of our discoveries offshore Ghana; it was one of the largest oil discoveries worldwide in 2007 and is considered one of the largest finds offshore West Africa during that decade. As technical operator of the initial phase of the Jubilee Field, we led an Integrated Project Team ("IPT") that planned and executed the development. Oil production from the Jubilee Field began in November 2010, just 42 months after initial discovery, a record for a deepwater development in this water depth in West Africa.
Kosmos and our partners discovered the Tweneboa, Enyenra and Ntomme ("TEN") fields in 2009, 2010 and 2012, respectively. The TEN fields are being developed through a phased manner delivering first oil in August 2016, and thus, becoming our second producing asset offshore Ghana. The project was delivered on time and within budget. 
Following our Initial Public Offering in 2011, we acquired several new exploration licenses and again proved a new geologic concept with the Ahmeyim discovery (formerly known as Tortue) in the deepwater offshore Mauritania in 2015. The Ahmeyim discovery was one of the largest natural gas discoveries worldwide in 2015 and is believed to be the largest ever gas discovery offshore West Africa. We have since demonstrated the extension of this gas discovery into Senegal with the successful Guembeul-1 exploration well, which we collectively call the Greater Tortue discovery. We have now drilled six successful exploration and appraisal wells offshore Mauritania and Senegal, and in aggregate have discovered a gross potential natural gas resource of approximately 40 trillion cubic feet and derisked over 40 trillion cubic feet.

In November 2017, through a joint venture with an affiliate of Trident Energy ("Trident"), we acquired all of the equity interest of Hess International Petroleum Inc., a subsidiary of Hess Corporation ("Hess"), which holds an 85% paying interest (80.75% revenue interest) in the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex assets. Under the terms of the agreement with Trident, Kosmos and Trident each own 50% of Hess International Petroleum Inc. Hess International Petroleum Inc. was subsequently renamed Kosmos-Trident International Petroleum Inc. ("KTIPI"). The gross acquisition price was $650 million effective as of January 1, 2017. Kosmos paid net cash consideration of approximately $231 million at close in November 2017, after customary purchase price adjustments. The transaction is accounted for as an equity method investment. Kosmos is primarily responsible for exploration and subsurface evaluation while Trident is primarily responsible for production operations and optimization. The transaction expands our position in the Gulf of Guinea and provides immediate cash flow through existing production with potential to increase existing production and also provides step-out exploration opportunities with potential low cost tie-back through existing infrastructure. 
Our business strategy focuses on achieving three key objectives: (1) maximize the value of our producing assets; (2) appraise and develop our discovered resources offshore Mauritania and Senegal; and (3) increase value further through a high‑impact exploration program which is designed to unlock new petroleum systems. We are focused on increasing production, cash flows and reserves from the Jubilee and TEN fields as well as our recently acquired Ceiba and Okume fields. In Mauritania and Senegal, we expect to fully appraise our Greater Tortue discovery with the objective of making a final investment decision around the end of 2018 and producing first gas in late 2021, as well as advance our other discoveries to development. We also have a large inventory of leads and prospects in our exploration portfolio which we plan to continue to mature for future drilling. We plan to test the prospectivity of high impact opportunities in the coming years along the Atlantic Margins.

Our Business Strategy
Grow proved reserves and production through exploration, appraisal and development
In the near‑term, we plan to grow proved reserves and production by further developing our fields offshore Ghana and Equatorial Guinea. In Ghana, we plan to resume drilling at both the Jubilee Field, which now includes our Mahogany and Teak discoveries, pursuant to the Greater Jubilee Full Field Development Plan (“GJFFDP”), and at TEN through the drilling of additional development and production wells in 2018. In Equatorial Guinea, through our joint venture with Trident, we plan to maximize reserves and production through production optimization and in-fill drilling. In addition, we plan to sanction the first phase of the Greater Tortue development offshore Mauritania and Senegal which will define the path to first gas. Growth could also be realized through the development of all or a portion of our other discoveries in Mauritania and Senegal.
Focus on optimally developing our discoveries to initial production
Our development focus is designed to accelerate production, deliver early learnings and maximize returns. In certain circumstances, we believe a phased approach can be employed to optimize full‑field development through a better understanding of dynamic reservoir behavior and enable activities to be performed in a parallel rather than a sequential manner. A phased approach also facilitates refinement of the development plans based on experience gained in initial phases of production and by leveraging existing infrastructure as subsequent phases of development are implemented. Production and reservoir performance from the initial phases are monitored closely to determine the most efficient and effective techniques to maximize the recovery of reserves and returns. Other benefits include minimizing upfront capital costs, reducing execution risks through smaller initial infrastructure requirements, and enabling cash flow from the initial phases of production to fund a portion of capital costs for subsequent phases. In contrast, a traditional development approach consists of full appraisal, conceptual engineering, preliminary engineering, detailed engineering, procurement and fabrication of facilities, development drilling and installation of facilities for the full‑field development, all performed sequentially, before first production is achieved. This traditional approach can considerably lengthen the time from discovery to first production.
For example, post‑discovery in 2007, first oil production from the Jubilee Field commenced in November 2010. This development timeline from discovery to first oil was significantly less than the seven to ten year industry average and set a record for a deepwater development of this size and scale at this water depth in West Africa. This condensed timeline reflects the lessons learned by our experienced team while leading other large scale deepwater developments. The Greater Tortue development is also expected to be developed in an accelerated, phased approach consistent with our business strategy. 
Successfully open and develop our offshore exploration plays
We believe the prospects and leads offshore Equatorial Guinea, Mauritania, Senegal, Sao Tome and Principe, Cote d'Ivoire, and Suriname provide favorable opportunities to create substantial value through exploration drilling. During 2018, we plan to test this potential in Suriname and in other areas starting in 2019. Given the potential size of these prospects and leads, we believe that exploratory success in our operating areas could significantly add to our growth profile.
Identify, access and explore frontier and emerging regions and hydrocarbon plays
Our management and exploration teams have demonstrated an ability to identify regions and hydrocarbon plays that have the potential to yield multiple large commercial discoveries. We focus on frontier and emerging areas that have been under-explored yet offer attractive commercial terms as a result of reduced competition and first‑mover advantage. We expect to continue to use our systematic and proven geologically‑focused approach in frontier and emerging petroleum systems where geological data suggests hydrocarbon accumulations are likely to exist, but where commercial discoveries have yet to be made. We believe this focus on poorly understood, under‑explored or otherwise overlooked hydrocarbon basins enables us to unlock significant hydrocarbon potential and create substantial value for shareholders.
This approach and focus, coupled with a first‑mover advantage and our management and technical teams’ discipline in execution, provide a competitive advantage in identifying and accessing new strategic growth opportunities. We expect to continue seeking new opportunities where hydrocarbons have not been discovered or produced in meaningful quantities by leveraging the reputation and relationships of our experienced technical and management teams. This includes our existing areas of interest as well as selectively expanding our reach into other locations.
In addition to ideas developed organically, farm‑in opportunities may offer a way to participate in new venture opportunities to undertake exploration in emerging basins, new plays and fairways to enhance and optimize our portfolio. Consistent 
9

with this strategy, we may also evaluate potential corporate and asset acquisition opportunities as a source of new ventures to support and expand our asset portfolio.
Kosmos Exploration Approach
Kosmos’ exploration philosophy is deeply rooted in a fundamental, geologically‑based approach geared toward the identification of poorly understood, under‑explored or overlooked petroleum systems. This process begins with detailed geologic studies that methodically assess a particular region’s subsurface, with careful consideration given to those attributes that suggest working petroleum systems. The process includes basin modeling to predict oil or gas charge and fluid migration, as well as stratigraphic and structural analysis to identify reservoir/seal pair development and trap definition. This analysis integrates data from previously drilled wells, where available, and seismic data. Importantly, this approach also takes into account a detailed analysis of geologic timing to ensure that we have an appropriate understanding of whether the sequencing of geological events could promote and preserve hydrocarbon accumulations. Once an area is high‑graded based on this play/fairway analysis, geophysical analysis based on new 3D seismic is conducted to identify prospective traps of interest.
Alongside the subsurface analysis, Kosmos performs an analysis of country‑specific risks to gain an understanding of the “above‑ground” dynamics, which may influence a particular country’s relative desirability from an overall oil and natural gas operating and risk‑adjusted return perspective. This process is employed in both areas that have existing oil and natural gas production, as well as those regions that have yet to achieve commercial hydrocarbon production.
Once an area of interest has been identified, Kosmos targets licenses over the particular basin or fairway to achieve an early‑mover or in many cases a first‑mover advantage. In terms of license selection, Kosmos targets specific regions that have sufficient size to manage exploration risks and provide scale should the exploration concept prove successful. Kosmos also looks for long‑term contract duration to enable the “right” exploration program to be executed, play type diversity to provide multiple exploration concept options, prospect dependency to enhance the chance of replicating success and sufficiently attractive fiscal terms to maximize the commercial viability of discovered hydrocarbons.
Apply our entrepreneurial culture, which fosters innovation and creativity, to continue our successful exploration and development program
Our employees are critical to the success of our business strategy and we have created an environment that enables them to focus their knowledge, skills and experience on finding and developing new fields. Culturally, we have an open, team‑oriented work environment that fosters entrepreneurial, creative and contrarian thinking. This approach enables us to fully consider and understand both risk and reward, as well as deliberately and collectively pursue strategies that create and maximize value. This philosophy and approach was successfully utilized offshore Ghana, Mauritania and Senegal, resulting in the discovery of significant new petroleum systems, which the industry previously did not consider either prospective or commercially viable.
Build the right strategic partnerships with complementary capabilities
We look to partner with high quality industry players with world‑class complementary capabilities early in our exploration projects. This strategy is designed to ensure that upon successful exploration and appraisal activities, the project can benefit from specific expertise provided by these partners, including exploration, development, production and above-ground capabilities. We have proven we can execute this strategy by partnering with supermajors including BP PLC ("BP"), Chevron Corporation (“Chevron”) and Total S.A. ("Total") across our exploration portfolio. In addition, bringing in the right strategic partners early in our projects often comes with a financial carry on future expenditures, allowing us to reduce our cost basis and increase return on investment.
During the second quarter of 2017, we formed the Kosmos-BP Strategic Exploration Alliance ("Alliance"). This Alliance broadens the relationship that previously covered new venture opportunities in Mauritania, Senegal and The Gambia to create an Atlantic Margin explorer-developer partnership. The Alliance leverages our regional exploration knowledge and capability together with BP's deepwater development expertise to execute a selective, joint frontier and emerging basin exploration strategy in the Atlantic Margin.

Maintain Financial Discipline
We strive to maintain a conservative financial profile and strong balance sheet with ample liquidity. Typically, we fund exploration and development activities from a combination of operating cash flows, debt and partner carries. As of December 31, 2017, after consideration of the refinancing of our RBL Facility in February 2018 which increased our availability to $1.5 billion, we had approximately $1.3 billion of liquidity available to fund our opportunities. During 2017, Kosmos generated approximately $236.6 million of cash flow from operations.
Additionally, we use derivative instruments to partially limit our exposure to fluctuations in oil prices and interest rates. We have an active commodity hedging program where we aim to hedge a portion of our anticipated sales volumes on a two‑to‑three year rolling basis. As of December 31, 2017, we have hedged positions covering 19.4 million barrels of oil from 2018 through 2019 oil production, which provide partial downside protection should Dated Brent oil prices fall below our floor prices. We also maintain insurance to partially protect against loss of production revenues from our producing assets.
Operations by Geographic Area
We currently have operations in Africa and South America. Presently, all operating revenues are generated from our operations offshore Ghana. We also have an equity method investment generating revenues with operations offshore Equatorial Guinea.

(2) | The Jubilee Field straddles the boundary between the West Cape Three Points (“WCTP”) petroleum contract and the Deepwater Tano (“DT”) petroleum contract offshore Ghana. To optimize resource recovery in this field, we entered into the Unitization and Unit Operating Agreement (the “UUOA”) in July 2009 with the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (“GNPC”) and the other block partners of each of these two blocks. The UUOA governs the interests in and development of the Jubilee Field and created the Jubilee Unit from portions of the WCTP petroleum contract and the DT petroleum contract areas. As a result of the approval of the GJFFDP by Ghana’s Ministry of Energy in October 2017, operatorship for the Mahogany and Teak discoveries transferred to Tullow which are now included in the Jubilee Field.

Ghana
The WCTP Block and DT Block are located within the Tano Basin, offshore Ghana. This basin contains a proven world‑class petroleum system as evidenced by our discoveries. The following is a brief discussion of our discoveries on our license areas offshore Ghana.
Jubilee Field
The Jubilee Field was discovered by Kosmos in 2007, with first oil produced in November 2010. Appraisal activities confirmed that the Jubilee discovery straddled the WCTP and DT Blocks. Pursuant to the terms of the UUOA, the discovery area was unitized for purposes of joint development by the WCTP and DT Block partners. 
The Jubilee Field is a combination structural‑stratigraphic trap with reservoir intervals consisting of a series of stacked Upper Cretaceous Turonian‑aged, deepwater turbidite fan lobe and channel deposits.
The Jubilee Field is located approximately 37 miles offshore Ghana in water depths of approximately 3,250 to 5,800 feet, which led to the decision to implement an FPSO based development. The FPSO is designed to provide water and natural gas injection to support reservoir pressure, to process and store oil and to export gas through a pipeline to the mainland. The Jubilee Field is being developed in a phased approach. The Phase 1 development focused on partial development of certain reservoirs in the Jubilee Field. The Kosmos‑led Integrated Project Team (“IPT”) successfully executed the initial 17 well development plan, which included nine producing wells that produced through subsea infrastructure to the “Kwame Nkrumah” FPSO, six water injection wells and two natural gas injection wells. This initial phase provided subsea infrastructure capacity for additional production and injection wells to be drilled in future phases of development.
The Phase 1A development plan provided further development to the currently producing Jubilee Field reservoirs. The Phase 1A development included the drilling of eight additional wells consisting of five production wells and three water injection wells. Approval was given for an additional well, a gas injector, considered as part of Phase 1A. The Phase 1A Addendum PoD was submitted to the Ministry of Energy in June 2015 and deemed approved in July 2015 to enable drilling and completion of two additional wells consisting of one production well and one water injection well.
The Greater Jubilee Full Field Development Plan (“GJFFDP”) was resubmitted to the government of Ghana in September 2017 and subsequently approved in October 2017. This plan, which is expected to increase proved reserves and extend the field production profile, has been optimized to reduce overall capital expenditures to reflect the current oil price market. In November 2015, we signed the Jubilee Field Unit Expansion Agreement with our partners, which became effective upon approval of the GJFFDP, to allow for the development of the Mahogany and Teak discoveries through the Jubilee FPSO and infrastructure, thus reducing their development cost. As a result of the approval of the GJFFDP by the Ministry of Energy in October 2017, operatorship for the Mahogany and Teak discoveries transferred to Tullow. The WCTP partners transferred operatorship of the remaining portions of the WCTP Block, including the Akasa discovery, to Tullow effective February 1, 2018. Kosmos continues to assist Tullow with the transition process, which is expected to extend into the first half of 2018.
The Government of Ghana completed the construction and connection of a gas pipeline from the Jubilee Field to transport natural gas to the mainland for processing and sale. In November 2014, the transportation of gas produced from the Jubilee Field commenced through the gas pipeline to the onshore gas plant. However, the uptime of the facility in future periods is not known. In the absence of the continuous export of large quantities of natural gas from the Jubilee Field, it is anticipated that we will need to reinject or flare such natural gas. Our inability to continuously export associated natural gas in large quantities from the Jubilee Field could impact our oil production.
In prior years, certain near wellbore productivity issues were identified, impacting several Phase 1 production wells. The Jubilee Unit partners identified a means of successfully mitigating the near wellbore productivity issues with ongoing acid stimulation treatments. We have also experienced mechanical issues in the Jubilee Field, including failures of our water injection and gas compression facilities on the FPSO. This equipment downtime negatively impacted past oil production. We are in the process of correcting mechanical issues experienced in the Jubilee Field.
In February 2016, the Jubilee Field operator identified an issue with the turret bearing of the FPSO Kwame Nkrumah. This necessitated the FPSO to be shut down for an extended period beginning in March 2016 with production resuming in early May 2016. This resulted in the need to implement new operating and offloading procedures, including the use of tug boats for heading control and a dynamically positioned (“DP”) shuttle tanker and storage vessel for offloading.
15

Kosmos and its partners have determined the preferred long-term solution to the turret bearing issue is to convert the FPSO to a permanently spread moored facility. The Jubilee turret remediation work is progressing as planned and the FPSO spread-mooring at its current heading was completed in February 2017. This allowed the tug boats previously required to hold the vessel on a fixed heading to be removed, significantly reducing the cost and complexity of the current operation. The next phase of the remediation work involves lifting and locking the main turret bearing. With regard to the turret remediation plan, the partnership is aligned on the engineering solution. This involves a shutdown to stabilize the turret bearing during the first quarter of 2018 followed by work to rotate the vessel to a new heading and permanently spread moor the vessel. The turret stabilization shutdown is being conducted in two phases, the first of which is complete and oil production is back online. The second phase is expected to commence around the end of the first quarter of 2018, and we anticipate the overall shutdown of oil production for both phases to be around four weeks. It is anticipated the gas system will be shut-in for slightly longer to complete non-turret related maintenance. We now expect the rotation of the vessel to take place around the end of 2018 with minimal impact to production in 2018. 
The financial impact of lower Jubilee production as well as the additional expenditures associated with the damage to the turret bearing is mitigated through a combination of the comprehensive Hull and Machinery insurance (“H&M”), procured by the operator, Tullow, on behalf of the Jubilee Unit partners, and the corporate Loss of Production Income (“LOPI”) insurance procured by Kosmos. Our LOPI coverage for this incident ended in May 2017 and the final cash proceeds were received in August 2017. Oil production from the Jubilee Field averaged approximately 93,500 barrels (gross) of oil per day during 2017. 
Tweneboa, Enyenra and Ntomme ("TEN")
The TEN fields are located in the western and central portions of the DT Block, approximately 30 miles offshore Ghana in water depths of approximately 3,300 to 5,700 feet. In November 2012, we submitted a declaration of commerciality and PoD over the TEN discoveries. In May 2013, the government of Ghana approved the TEN PoD. The discoveries are being jointly developed with shared infrastructure and a single FPSO.
The TEN fields consist of multiple stratigraphic traps with reservoir intervals consisting of a series of stacked Upper Cretaceous Turonian‑aged, deepwater fan lobes and channel deposits.
The TEN fields are being developed in a phased manner. The TEN PoD was designed to include an expandable subsea system that would provide for multiple phases. Phase 1 of the TEN PoD includes the drilling and completion of up to 17 wells, 11 of which have been completed. Seven additional development wells are expected to be drilled during Phase 2. The remaining Phase 1 and Phase 2 wells are a combination of production wells and water or gas injection wells needed to maximize recovery. 
Following first oil from the TEN fields in August 2016, oil production and water injection systems were commissioned and are now operational. In January 2017, the capacity of the FPSO was successfully tested at an average rate of 80,000 Bopd during a short-term flow test. However, due to certain issues with managing pressures in the Enyenra reservoir and because no new wells could be drilled until after the previously disclosed Special Chamber of the International Tribunal of the Sea (ITLOS) ruling , the operator has elected to manage the existing wells in a prudent manner to optimize long-term recovery over the lifetime of the field. This reservoir management is not expected to negatively impact the ultimate field recovery. In September 2017, ITLOS issued its final decision in the maritime boundary dispute between the Governments of Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire. The maritime boundary delimited by the Special Chamber's decision had no impact on TEN production or reserves or otherwise on our interests in Ghana. Production from TEN in the year ended December 31, 2017 averaged approximately 55,800 bopd. We expect to resume drilling in early 2018 and production is expected to increase towards FPSO capacity.
The construction and connection of a gas pipeline between the Jubilee and TEN fields to transport natural gas to the mainland for processing and sale was completed in the first quarter of 2017. In December 2017, we signed the TEN Associated-Gas Gas Sales Agreement (TAG GSA) and we expect to begin exporting TEN associated gas to shore in the second quarter of 2018. The TAG GSA provides for a sales price of $0.50 price per mmbtu. However, the uptime of the gas processing facility in future periods is not known. Our inability to continuously export associated natural gas in large quantities from the TEN fields could impact our oil production.
Other Ghana Discoveries
The Akasa discovery is located in the western portion of the WCTP Block approximately 31 miles offshore Ghana in water depths of approximately 3,200 to 5,050 feet. The discovery is southeast of the Jubilee Field. We believe the target reservoirs are channels and lobes that are stratigraphically trapped. The Akasa‑1 well intersected oil bearing reservoirs in the Turonian zones. Fluid samples recovered from the well indicate an oil gravity of 38 degrees API. 
16

The Wawa discovery is located within the DT Block, north of the TEN fields. The Wawa‑1 exploration well intersected oil and gas‑condensate in a Turonian‑aged turbidite channel system. In April 2016, the Ghana Ministry of Energy approved our request to enlarge the TEN development and production area subject to continued subsurface and development concept evaluation, along with the requirement to integrate the Wawa Discovery into the TEN PoD.
Mauritania
The C6, C8, C12, C13 and C18 blocks are located on the western margin of the Mauritania Salt Basin offshore Mauritania. These blocks are located in a proven petroleum system, with our primary targets being Cretaceous sands in structural and stratigraphic traps. We believe that the Triassic salt basin formed at the onset of rifting and contains Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary passive margin sequences of limestones, sandstone and shales. Interpretation of available geologic and geophysical data has identified Cretaceous slope channels and basin floor fans in trapping geometries outboard of the Salt Basin as the key exploration objective. Multiple Cretaceous source rocks penetrated by wells and typed to oils and gases in the Mauritania Salt Basin are the same age as those which charge other oil and gas fields in West Africa.
A portion of this acreage is located outboard of the Chinguetti Field and ranges in water depth from 330 to 9,800 feet. These blocks cover an aggregate area of approximately 6.0 million acres. We have acquired approximately 6,300 line-kilometers of 2D seismic data and 15,800 square kilometers of 3D seismic data covering portions of our blocks in Mauritania. Based on these 2D and 3D seismic programs, we have drilled two successful exploration wells and an appraisal well, and have identified numerous additional prospects in our blocks. We continue to integrate the results of our drilling program in Mauritania to identify and mature primary targets in preparation for drilling. 
Senegal
The Senegal Blocks are located in the Senegal River Cretaceous petroleum system and range in water depth from 980 to 10,200 feet. The area is an extension of the working petroleum system in the Mauritania Salt Basin. We believe the area has multiple Cretaceous source rocks with Albian through Cenomanian reservoir sands providing exploration targets. We acquired approximately 7,000 square kilometers of 3D seismic data over the central and eastern portions of the Senegal Blocks in January 2015. In February 2016, we completed a 4,500 square kilometer survey over the western portions of the Senegal Blocks to fully evaluate the prospectivity. We have drilled two successful exploration wells and an appraisal well, and have identified numerous prospects in our blocks and we continue to mature these for drilling. 
The following is a brief discussion of our discoveries to date offshore Mauritania and Senegal.
Greater Tortue Discovery
The Ahmeyim and Guembeul discoveries (collectively “Greater Tortue”) are significant, play-opening gas discoveries for the outboard Cretaceous petroleum system and are located approximately 75 miles offshore Mauritania and Senegal. The Greater Tortue discovery straddles Block C8 offshore Mauritania and Saint Louis Offshore Profond offshore Senegal.
We have now drilled three wells within the Greater Tortue discovery. The wells penetrated multiple excellent quality gas reservoirs, including the Lower Cenomanian, Upper Cenomanian and underlying Albian. The wells successfully delineated the Ahmeyim and Guembeul gas discoveries and demonstrated reservoir continuity, as well as static pressure communication between the three wells drilled within the Lower Cenomanian reservoir. The discovery ranges in water depths from 8,850 feet to 9,200 feet, with total depths drilled ranging from 16,700 feet to 17,200 feet.
The Tortue-1 discovery well, located in Block C8 offshore Mauritania, intersected approximately 117 meters (383 feet) of net hydrocarbon pay. A single gas pool was encountered in the Lower Cenomanian objective, which is comprised of three reservoirs totaling 88 meters (288 feet) in thickness over a gross hydrocarbon interval of 160 meters (528 feet). A fourth reservoir totaling 19 meters (62 feet) was penetrated within the Upper Cenomanian target over a gross hydrocarbon interval of 150 meters (492 feet). The exploration well also intersected an additional 10 meters (32 feet) of net hydrocarbon pay in the lower Albian section, which is interpreted to be gas.
The Guembeul-1 discovery well, located in the northern part of the Saint Louis Offshore Profond area in Senegal, is located approximately three miles south of the Tortue-1 exploration well in Mauritania. The well encountered 101 meters (331 feet) of net gas pay in two excellent quality reservoirs, including 56 meters (184 feet) in the Lower Cenomanian and 45 meters (148 feet) in the underlying Albian, with no water encountered.
The Ahmeyim-2 appraisal well is located in Block C8 offshore Mauritania, approximately three miles northwest, and 200 meters down-dip of the basin-opening Tortue-1 discovery. The well confirmed significant thickening of the gross reservoir 
17

sequences down-dip. The Ahmeyim-2 well encountered 78 meters (256 feet) of net gas pay in two excellent quality reservoirs, including 46 meters (151 feet) in the Lower Cenomanian and 32 meters (105 feet) in the underlying Albian.
In August 2017, we announced the successful completion of the drill stem test ("DST") of the Tortue-1 well, demonstrating that the Tortue field is a world-class resource and confirming key development parameters including well deliverability, reservoir connectivity, and fluid composition. The Tortue-1 well flowed at a sustained, equipment-constrained rate of approximately 60 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd) during the main extended flow period, with minimal pressure drawdown, providing confidence in well designs that are each capable of producing approximately 200 MMcfd. The DST results confirmed a connected volume per well consistent with the current development scheme, which together with the high well rate is expected to result in a low number of development wells compared to equivalent schemes. Initial analysis of fluid samples collected during the test indicate Tortue gas is well suited for liquefaction given low levels of liquids and minimal impurities. Data acquired from the DST will be used to further optimize field development and to refine process design parameters critical to the front end engineering and design ("FEED") process.
Other Mauritania and Senegal Discoveries
The BirAllah discovery (formally known as Marsouin), located in Block C8 offshore Mauritania, is a significant, play-extending gas discovery, building on our successful exploration program in the outboard Cretaceous petroleum system offshore Mauritania. The Marsouin-1 well is located approximately 37 miles north of the Ahmeyim discovery and was drilled to a total depth of 16,900 feet in nearly 7,900 feet of water. Based on analysis of drilling results and logging data, Marsouin-1 encountered at least 70 meters (230 feet) of net gas pay in Upper and Lower Cenomanian intervals comprised of excellent quality reservoir sands.
The Teranga discovery is located in the Cayar Offshore Profond block approximately 40 miles northwest of Dakar, and was our second exploration well offshore Senegal. The Teranga-1 discovery well is located in nearly 5,900 feet of water and was drilled to a total depth of 15,900 feet. The well encountered 31 meters (102 feet) of net gas pay in good quality reservoir in the Lower Cenomanian objective. Well results confirm that a prolific inboard gas fairway extends approximately 125 miles south from the Marsouin-1 well in Mauritania through the Greater Tortue area on the maritime boundary to the Teranga-1 well in Senegal.
The Yakaar discovery is located in the Cayar Offshore Profond block offshore Senegal, approximately 60 miles northwest of Dakar in approximately 2,600 meters of water. The Yakaar-1 discovery well was drilled to a total depth of approximately 4,900 meters. The well intersected a gross hydrocarbon column of 120 meters (394 feet) in three pools within the primary Lower Cenomanian objective and encountered 45 meters (148 feet) of net pay.
These discoveries collectively have discovered a gross potential natural gas resource of approximately 40 trillion cubic feet and as such derisked over 40 trillion cubic feet in the basin.
Equatorial Guinea
In October 2017, we entered into petroleum contracts covering Blocks EG-21, S, and W with the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. Ratification of the petroleum contracts by the President of Equatorial Guinea is required before the contracts become effective. The petroleum contracts cover approximately 6,000 square kilometers, with a first exploration period of five years from the date of notification of ratification by the President of Equatorial Guinea. The first exploration period consists of two sub-periods of three and two years, respectively. The first exploration sub-period work program includes an approximately 6,000 square kilometer 3D seismic acquisition requirement across the blocks.

Ceiba Field and Okume Complex - Equity Method Investment
In the fourth quarter of 2017, through a joint venture with an affiliate of Trident, we acquired all of the equity interest of Hess International Petroleum Inc., a subsidiary of Hess, which holds an 85% paying interest (80.75% revenue interest) in the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex assets. Under the terms of the agreement, Kosmos and Trident each own 50% of Hess International Petroleum Inc. Hess International Petroleum Inc. was subsequently renamed Kosmos-Trident International Petroleum Inc. ("KTIPI"). Kosmos is primarily responsible for exploration and subsurface evaluation while Trident is primarily responsible for production operations and optimization. The transaction expands our position in the Gulf of Guinea and provides immediate cash flow through existing production with potential to increase existing production and also provides step-out exploration opportunities with potential low cost tie-back through existing infrastructure. The gross acquisition price is $650 million effective as of January 1, 2017. After post closing entries Kosmos paid net cash of approximately $231 million, with a combination of cash on hand and availability under the Facility. The transaction is accounted for as an equity method investment. Oil production from the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex averaged approximately 45,000 barrels (gross) of oil per day during the period we held an interest in 2017. 
Suriname
We are the operator for petroleum contracts covering Block 42 and Block 45 offshore Suriname, which are located within the Guyana Suriname Basin, along the Atlantic transform margin of northern South America. Suriname lies between Guyana to the west and French Guyana to the east. The Guyana-Suriname Basin was formed by tensional forces associated with the opening of the Atlantic Ocean as South America separated from Africa in the Mid Cretaceous period. The Suriname basin is considered similar to the working petroleum systems of the West African transform margin. The emerging petroleum system in Suriname has been proven by the presence of onshore producing fields and most recently by nearby discoveries offshore Guyana, including the Liza-1 well.
Suriname Block 42 and Block 45 are positioned centrally in the Suriname-Guyana Basin, and located to the east of the recent play opening Liza-1 oil discovery. Likewise, the blocks are also positioned to the northwest of the French Guyana Basins’ Zaedyus oil discovery.
We believe that there are several independent play types of importance on our operated blocks. Of note are the listric faulted structural stratigraphic play of the lower Cretaceous and the stratigraphically trapped Upper Cretaceous plays similar to those discovered in the Jubilee Field offshore West Africa. The recent oil discovery in Guyana (Liza-1) in the same geologic basin provides a positive point of calibration for the Upper Cretaceous stratigraphic play in Suriname. 
Target reservoirs in our blocks are similar Upper and Middle Cretaceous age basin floor fans and mid slope channel sands. Seismic evidence suggests thick Late Cretaceous and Tertiary reservoir systems may be present in the deep water area demonstrated by Liza-1.
The Tambaredjo and Calcutta Fields onshore Suriname, as well as the Liza-1 well discovery offshore Guyana, demonstrate that a working petroleum system exists, and geological and geochemical studies suggest the hydrocarbons in these fields were generated from source rocks located in the offshore basin. The source rocks are believed to be analogous in age to those which have charged numerous fields in offshore West Africa.
During 2012, we completed a 3D seismic data acquisition program which covered approximately 3,900 square kilometers over portions of Block 42 and Block 45 offshore Suriname. In August 2013, we completed a 2D seismic program of approximately 1,400 line kilometers over a portion of Block 42, outside of the existing 3D seismic survey. The processing of the seismic data was completed during 2014. In December 2015, we received an extension of Phase 1 of the Exploration Period for Block 42 offshore Suriname which now expires in September 2018. In April 2016, we received an extension of Phase 1 of the Exploration Period for Block 45 offshore Suriname which now expires in September 2018.
In January 2017, we completed a 3D seismic survey of approximately 6,500 square kilometers over Block 42 and Block 45 offshore Suriname. Processing of this data is currently ongoing. We have compiled an initial inventory of prospects on the license areas in Suriname and will continue to refine and assess the prospectivity, integrating this new 3D seismic data, with plans to drill in 2018.
19

Sao Tome and Principe
During 2015 and 2016, Kosmos acquired acreage in Blocks 5, 6, 11 and 12 offshore Sao Tome and Principe in the Gulf of Guinea. We are the operator of Blocks 5, 11 and 12, and Galp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Petrogal, S.A., is the operator of Block 6. These blocks cover an area of approximately 5.8 million acres in water depth ranging from 7,380 to 9,840 feet and provide an opportunity to pursue the same core Cretaceous theme that was successful for us in Ghana.
Our blocks are adjacent to, and represent an extension of a proven and prolific petroleum system offshore Equatorial Guinea and northern Gabon comprising Early Cretaceous post-rift source rocks and Late Cretaceous reservoirs.
We believe that the southern extent of the West African transform margin in Sao Tome and Principe comprises a series of Albian pull-apart basins formed during the separation of Africa from South America, providing the necessary conditions for the generation, migration and entrapment of hydrocarbons. Early in the basin history, restricted marine conditions prevailed allowing rich source rocks to be deposited. Large sandstone depo-centers were developed at the structural junctions of rift and shear fault trends resulting in the deposition of deep-water slope channels and basin floor fans draping over and around anticlinal highs adjacent to fracture zones. These constitute the main play in the acreage.
In December 2016, we received approval for a two-year extension of Phase 1 for Block 5 offshore Sao Tome and Principe, which now expires in May 2019. Additionally, during the same month we assigned 20% participating interest to Galp in each of Blocks 5, 11 and 12 offshore Sao Tome and Principe. Based on the terms of the agreement, Galp has paid a proportionate share of Kosmos’ past costs in the form of a partial carry on the 3D seismic survey.
In August 2017, we completed a 3D seismic survey of approximately 15,800 square kilometers over Blocks 5, 6, 11, and 12 offshore Sao Tome and Principe. Processing of this data is currently underway. We are compiling an initial inventory of prospects on the license areas in Sao Tome and Principe and will continue to refine and assess the prospectivity, integrating this new 3D seismic data into our geological evaluation during 2018 with a view to drilling as early as 2019.
In November 2017, we received approval for a one-year extension of Phase 1 for Block 11 offshore Sao Tome and Principe, which now expires in July 2019.
Morocco and Western Sahara
Our petroleum contracts in Morocco and Western Sahara include the Boujdour Maritime block, which is within the Aaiun Basin, and the Essaouira Offshore Block, which is within the Agadir Basin. We are the operator of these petroleum contracts.
Aaiun Basin
In November 2017, we provided to our co-venturers a notice of withdrawal from the the Boujdour Maritime block offshore Western Sahara and transferred our participating interest and operatorship to ONHYM. We are providing certain transition services to ONHYM as part of the handover of operatorship. In order to complete our obligations under the petroleum contract, we will continue to fund the remainder of the current seismic program.
Agadir Basin
The Essaouira Offshore block is located in the Agadir Basin. A working petroleum system has been established in the onshore area of the Agadir Basin based on onshore and shallow offshore wells. Existing well data and geological and geochemical studies have demonstrated the presence of Cretaceous source rocks in the acreage. Onshore production suggests that possible Jurassic source rocks are also present in the offshore Agadir Basin.
In June 2017, we completed a 3D seismic survey of approximately 3,000 square kilometers over the Essaouira Offshore Block. Additional geological studies are expected to be conducted beginning in the first quarter of 2018. The current phase of the Essaouira Offshore petroleum contract expires in November 2018.
Cote d'Ivoire
In December 2017, as part of our Alliance with BP, we entered into petroleum contracts as operator for five Offshore Blocks, CI-526, CI-602, CI-603, CI-707 and CI-708, which are located in a cenomanian-turonian petroleum system and range in water depth from 1,500 to 15,000 feet. The area is located approximately 150 kilometers west of our TEN discoveries in Ghana. We believe the area has multiple Cretaceous source rocks with Cenomanian through Maastrichtian reservoir sands providing 
20

exploration targets. We plan to acquire approximately 12,000 square kilometers of 3D seismic data over the blocks during 2018 to evaluate the prospectivity. 
Portugal
In January 2017, we provided to our co-venturers a notice of withdrawal from the Ameijoa, Camarao, Mexilhao and Ostra Blocks offshore Portugal.
BP Alliance
During the second quarter of 2017, we formed the Alliance. This Alliance broadens the relationship that previously covered new venture opportunities in Mauritania, Senegal and The Gambia to create an Atlantic Margin explorer-developer partnership. The Alliance leverages our regional exploration knowledge and capability together with BP's deepwater development expertise to execute a selective, joint frontier and emerging basin exploration strategy in the Atlantic Margin.
Our Reserves
The following table sets forth summary information about our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Supplemental Oil and Gas Data (Unaudited)” for additional information.
Our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, were associated with our Jubilee and the TEN fields in Ghana as well as our share of our equity method investment in the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex in Equatorial Guinea. Our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 were associated with our Jubilee and TEN fields in Ghana.

______________________________________

(1) | Our reserves associated with the Jubilee Field are based on the 54.4%/45.6% redetermination split, between the WCTP Block and DT Block. Totals within the table may not add as a result of rounding.


(2) | These reserves represent the estimated quantities of fuel gas required to operate the Jubilee and TEN FPSOs during normal field operations and the associated gas forecasted to be exported from TEN. This volume of associated gas is included as of December 31, 2017 as a result of the finalization of the TEN Associated-Gas Gas Sales Agreement (TAG GSA). If and when a subsequent gas sales agreement is executed for Jubilee, a portion of the remaining Jubilee gas may be recognized as reserves. If and when a gas sales agreement and the related infrastructure are in place for the TEN fields non-associated gas, a portion of the remaining gas may be recognized as reserves. 


(3) | All of our proved undeveloped reserves are expected to be developed within six years or less. Proved undeveloped reserves expected to be developed beyond five years are related to long-term projects which will be completed under a continuous drilling program. As of December 31, 2017, we recognized 24.4 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves related to the Jubilee and TEN fields, representing approved future drilling in both fields.


(4) | We disclose our share of reserves that are accounted for by the equity method.

21

Changes for the year ended December 31, 2017, include an increase of 15.6 MMBbl in Jubilee related to the approval of the Greater Jubilee Full Field Development Plan (GJFFDP), partially offset by 7.7 MMBbl of net Jubilee production during 2017. Changes at TEN include an increase of 7.2 MMBoe as a result of positive Ntomme performance and the finalization of the TAG GSA, which was partially offset by 3.3 MMBbl of net TEN production during 2017. As a result of the approval of the GJFFDP, we now have 10.4 MMBbl of proved undeveloped reserves in the Greater Jubilee area, representing future infill drilling plans. Changes for 2017 also include the initial certification of proved volumes in Equatorial Guinea, representing the reserves associated with our equity method investment.
Changes for the year ended December 31, 2016, include an increase of 8.3 MMBbl in TEN related to a revision resulting from additional technical data and analysis, partially offset by 0.9 MMBbl of net TEN production during 2016, and negative revisions to Jubilee of 1.0 MMBbl due to lower oil prices and 6.2 MMBbl of net Jubilee production during 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we had 14 MMBoe of our proved undeveloped reserves from December 31, 2015 convert to proved developed reserves due to the completion of seven wells in the TEN fields, the initiation of TEN production and 2016 revisions, and we incurred $198.5 million of capital expenditures for TEN.
Changes for the year ended December 31, 2015, include an increase of 11.8 MMBbl of net proved reserves related to Jubilee field performance and in‑fill drilling results, which were partially offset by negative revisions to the TEN fields of 2.1 MMBbl due to lower oil prices and by 8.6 MMBbl of net Jubilee production during 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we had a 6 MMBoe reduction in our proved undeveloped reserves from December 31, 2014. The decrease was a result of an approximately 2 MMBoe negative revision associated with our TEN fields, due to shorter economic life as a result of lower oil price. We incurred $80.6 million of capital expenditures related the drilling and completion of two wells pursuant to the Jubilee Field Phase 1A and 1A addendum developments resulting in the conversion of approximately 3 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves associated with our Jubilee Field.

The following table sets forth the estimated future net revenues, excluding derivatives contracts, from net proved reserves and the expected benchmark prices used in projecting net revenues at December 31, 2017. All estimated future net revenues are attributable to projected production from the Jubilee and the TEN fields in Ghana and our equity method investment. If we are unable to export associated natural gas in large quantities from the Jubilee and TEN fields then production could be limited and the future net revenues discussed herein will be adversely affected.

(1) | PV‑10 represents the present value of estimated future revenues to be generated from the production of proved oil and natural gas reserves, net of future development and production costs, royalties, additional oil entitlements and future tax expense levied at an asset level, using prices based on an average of the first‑day‑of‑the‑months throughout 2017 and costs as of the date of estimation without future escalation, without giving effect to hedging activities, non‑property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and depreciation, depletion and amortization, and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10% to reflect the timing of future cash flows. PV‑10 is a non‑GAAP financial measure and often differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of future income tax expense related to proved oil and gas reserves levied at a corporate parent level on future net revenues. However, it does include the effects of future tax expense levied at an asset level. Neither PV‑10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our oil and natural gas assets. PV‑10 should not be considered as an alternative to the Standardized Measure as computed under GAAP; however, we and others in the industry use PV‑10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific corporate tax characteristics of such entities.


(2) | Standardized Measure represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows to be generated from the production of proved oil and natural gas reserves, net of future development and production costs, future income tax expense related to our proved oil and gas reserves levied at a corporate parent and intermediate subsidiary level, royalties, additional oil entitlements and future tax expense levied at an asset level, without giving effect to hedging activities, non‑property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and depreciation, depletion and amortization, and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10% to reflect timing of future cash flows and using the same pricing assumptions as were used to calculate PV‑10. Standardized Measure often differs from PV‑10 because Standardized Measure includes the effects of future income tax expense related to our proved oil and gas reserves levied at a corporate parent level on future net revenues. However, as we are a tax exempted company incorporated pursuant to the laws of Bermuda, we do not expect to be subject to future income tax expense related to our proved oil and gas reserves levied at a corporate parent level on future net revenues. Therefore, the year‑end 2017 estimate of PV‑10 is equivalent to the Standardized Measure.


(3) | The unweighted arithmetic average first‑day‑of‑the‑month prices for the prior 12 months was $54.42 for Dated Brent at December 31, 2017. The price was adjusted for crude handling, transportation fees, quality, and a regional price differential. These adjustments are estimated to include a $0.10 premium, a $0.02 premium and a $0.53 discount relative to Dated Brent for the Jubilee Field, TEN fields and our equity method investment, respectively. The adjusted price utilized to derive the Jubilee Field PV‑10, TEN PV-10 and equity method investment PV-10 is $54.52, $54.44 and $53.89, respectively.

(4) | Future net revenues and PV-10 have been adjusted from the reserve report which is based on the entitlements method as we account for oil and gas revenues under the sales method of accounting.

Estimated proved reserves
Unless otherwise specifically identified in this report, the summary data with respect to our estimated net proved reserves for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 has been prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (“RSC”), our independent reserve engineering firm for such years, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities. These rules require SEC reporting companies to prepare their reserve estimates using reserve definitions and pricing based on 12‑month historical unweighted first‑day‑of‑the‑month average prices, rather than year‑end prices. For a definition of proved reserves under the SEC rules, see the “Glossary and Selected Abbreviations.” For more information regarding our independent reserve engineers, please see “—Independent petroleum engineers” below.
Our estimated proved reserves and related future net revenues, PV‑10 and Standardized Measure were determined using index prices for oil, without giving effect to derivative transactions, and were held constant throughout the life of the assets.
Future net revenues represent projected revenues from the sale of proved reserves net of production and development costs (including operating expenses and production taxes). Such calculations at December 31, 2017 are based on costs in effect at December 31, 2017 and the 12‑month unweighted arithmetic average of the first‑day‑of‑the‑month price for the year ended December 31, 2017, adjusted for anticipated market premium, without giving effect to derivative transactions, and are held constant throughout the life of the assets. There can be no assurance that the proved reserves will be produced within the periods indicated or prices and costs will remain constant.
Independent petroleum engineers
Ryder Scott Company, L.P.
RSC, our independent reserve engineers for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, was established in 1937. For over 75 years, RSC has provided services to the worldwide petroleum industry that include the issuance of reserves reports and audits, appraisal of oil and gas properties including fair market value determination, reservoir simulation studies, enhanced recovery services, expert witness testimony, and management advisory services. RSC professionals subscribe to a code of professional conduct and RSC is a Registered Engineering Firm in the State of Texas.
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we engaged RSC to prepare independent estimates of the extent and value of the proved reserves of certain of our oil and gas properties. These reports were prepared at our request to estimate our reserves and related future net revenues and PV‑10 for the periods indicated therein. Our estimated reserves at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and related future net revenues and PV‑10 at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are taken from reports prepared by RSC, in accordance with petroleum engineering and evaluation principles which RSC believes are commonly used in the industry and definitions and current regulations established by the SEC. The December 31, 2017 reserve report was completed on January 13, 2018, and a copy is included as an exhibit to this report.
In connection with the preparation of the December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 reserves report, RSC prepared its own estimates of our proved reserves. In the process of the reserves evaluation, RSC did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by us with respect to ownership interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the fields and sales of production. However, if in the course of the examination something came to the attention of RSC which brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, RSC did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved its questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. RSC independently prepared reserves estimates to conform to the guidelines of the SEC, including the criteria of “reasonable certainty,” as it pertains to expectations about the recoverability of reserves in future years, under existing economic and operating conditions, consistent with the definition in Rule 4‑10(a)(2) of Regulation S‑X. RSC issued a report on our proved reserves at December 31, 2017, based upon its evaluation. RSC’s primary economic assumptions in estimates included an ability to sell Jubilee, TEN and our equity method investment field oil at a price of $54.52, $54.44 and $53.89, respectively, and certain levels of future capital expenditures. The assumptions, data, methods and precedents were appropriate for the purpose served by these reports, and RSC used all methods and procedures as it considered necessary under the circumstances to prepare the report.

Technology used to establish proved reserves
Under the SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have proved effective by actual comparison of production from projects in the same reservoir interval, an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
In order to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, RSC employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, production and injection data, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, acoustic logs, whole core analysis, sidewall core analysis, downhole pressure and temperature measurements, reservoir fluid samples, geochemical information, geologic maps, seismic data, well test and interference pressure and rate data. Reserves attributable to undeveloped locations were estimated using performance from analogous wells with similar geologic depositional environments, rock quality, appraisal plans and development plans to assess the estimated ultimate recoverable reserves as a function of the original oil in place. These qualitative measures are benchmarked and validated against sound petroleum reservoir engineering principles and equations to estimate the ultimate recoverable reserves volume. These techniques include, but are not limited to, nodal analysis, material balance, and numerical flow simulation.
Internal controls over reserves estimation process
In our Reservoir Engineering team, we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineering and geoscience professionals with significant international experience that contribute to our internal reserve and resource estimates. This team works closely with our independent petroleum engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished in their reserve and resource estimation process. Our Reservoir Engineering team is responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates and has over 100 combined years of industry experience among them with positions of increasing responsibility in engineering and evaluations. Each member of our team holds a minimum of Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering or geology.
The RSC technical person primarily responsible for preparing the estimates set forth in the RSC reserves report incorporated herein is Mr. Guadalupe Ramirez. Mr. Ramirez has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at RSC since 1981. Mr. Ramirez is a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (No. 48318) and has over 35 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering. He graduated from Texas A&M University in 1976 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Mechanical Engineering. Mr. Ramirez meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines.
The Audit Committee provides oversight on the processes utilized in the development of our internal reserve and resource estimates on an annual basis. In addition, our Reservoir Engineering team meets with representatives of our independent reserve engineers to review our assets and discuss methods and assumptions used in preparation of the reserve and resource estimates. Finally, our senior management reviews reserve and resource estimates on an annual basis.

Domestic Supply Requirements
Many of our petroleum contracts or, in some cases, the applicable law governing such agreements, grant a right to the respective host country to purchase certain amounts of oil/gas produced pursuant to such agreements at international market prices for domestic consumption. In addition, in connection with the approval of the Jubilee Phase 1 PoD, the Jubilee Field partners agreed to provide the first 200 Bcf of natural gas produced from the Jubilee Field Phase 1 development to GNPC at no cost. As of December 31, 2017, 78 Bcf of the 200 Bcf of natural gas has been provided.
Significant License Agreements
Below is a discussion concerning the petroleum contracts governing our current drilling and production operations.
West Cape Three Points Block
As a result of the approval of the GJFFDP by the Ghana Ministry of Energy in October 2017, operatorship for the Mahogany and Teak discoveries transferred to Tullow in February 2018 and are now included in the Jubilee Unit. Kosmos is required to pay a fixed royalty of 5% and a sliding‑scale royalty (“additional oil entitlement”) which escalates as the nominal project rate of return increases. These royalties are to be paid in‑kind or, at the election of the government of Ghana, in cash. A corporate tax rate of 35% is applied to profits at a country level.
The WCTP petroleum contract has a duration of 30 years from its effective date (July 2004). However, in July 2011, at the end of the seven‑year Exploration Period, parts of the WCTP Block on which we had not declared a discovery area, were not in a development and production area, or were not in the Jubilee Unit, were relinquished (“WCTP Relinquishment Area”). We maintain rights to the Akasa discovery within the WCTP Block as the WCTP petroleum contract remains in effect after the end of the Exploration Period. We and our WCTP Block partners have certain rights to negotiate a new petroleum contract with respect to the WCTP Relinquishment Area. We and our WCTP Block partners, the Ghana Ministry of Energy and GNPC have agreed such WCTP petroleum contract rights to negotiate extend from July 21, 2011 until such time as either a new petroleum contract is negotiated and entered into with us or we decline to match a bona fide third party offer GNPC may receive for the WCTP Relinquishment Area.
29

Deepwater Tano Block
Tullow is the operator of the Deepwater Tano Block. Under the DT petroleum contract, GNPC exercised its option to acquire an additional paying interest of 5% in the commercial discovery with respect to the Jubilee Field development and the TEN Fields development. Kosmos is required to pay a fixed royalty of 5% and an additional oil entitlement which escalates as the nominal project rate of return increases. These royalties are to be paid in‑kind or, at the election of the government of Ghana, in cash. A corporate tax rate of 35% is applied to profits at a country level.
In January 2013, at the end of the seven‑year Exploration Period, parts of the DT Block on which we had not declared a discovery area, were not in a development and production area, or were not in the Jubilee Unit, were relinquished (“DT Relinquishment Area”). Our existing Wawa discovery within the DT Block was not subject to relinquishment upon expiration of the Exploration Period of the DT petroleum contract, as the DT petroleum contract remains in effect after the end of the Exploration Period while commerciality is being determined. Pursuant to our DT petroleum contract, we and our DT Block partners have certain rights to negotiate a new petroleum contract with respect to the DT Relinquishment Area until such time as either a new petroleum contract is negotiated and entered into with us or we decline to match a bona fide third party offer GNPC may receive for the DT Relinquishment Area.
The Ghanaian Petroleum Exploration and Production Law of 1984 (PNDCL 84) (the “1984 Ghanaian Petroleum Law”) and the WCTP and DT petroleum contracts form the basis of our exploration, development and production operations on the WCTP and DT blocks. Pursuant to these petroleum contracts, most significant decisions, including PoDs and annual work programs, for operations other than exploration and appraisal, must be approved by a joint management committee, consisting of representatives of certain block partners and GNPC. Certain decisions require unanimity.
Jubilee Field Unitization
The Jubilee Field, discovered by the Mahogany‑1 well in June 2007, covers an area within both the WCTP and DT Blocks. It was agreed the Jubilee Field would be unitized for optimal resource recovery. A Pre-Unit Agreement was agreed to between the contractors groups of the WCTP and DT Blocks in 2008, with a more comprehensive unit agreement, the UUOA, agreed to in 2009 which govern each party’s respective rights and duties in the Jubilee Unit. Tullow is the Unit Operator, while Kosmos was the Technical Operator for the initial development of the Jubilee Field. The Jubilee Unit holders’ interests are subject to redetermination in accordance with the terms of the UUOA. Although the Jubilee Field is unitized, Kosmos’ participating interests in each block outside the boundary of the Jubilee Unit remain the same. Our Unit interest is 24.1% subject to redetermination of the participating interests pursuant to the terms of the UUOA. Our paying interest on development activities is 26.9%.
Morocco Exploration Agreements
Effective April 2, 2012, we entered into the Essaouria Offshore Petroleum Agreement as operator. During 2016, our partner BP, relinquished their participating interest in the petroleum contract. The Moroccan national oil company, ONHYM's, participating interest is carried by the block partners proportionately during the exploration phase. We are required to pay a 10% royalty on oil produced in water depths of 200 meters or less (the first 300,000 tons produced are exempt from royalty) and 7% royalty on oil produced in water depths deeper than 200 meters (the first 500,000 tons produced are exempt from royalty). These royalties are to be paid in‑kind or, at the election of the government of Morocco, in cash. A corporate tax rate of 30% is applied to profits at the license level following a 10‑year tax holiday post first production. The term of the Essaouria Offshore Permits, beginning November 8, 2011, is eight years and includes an initial exploration period of two years and six months followed by the first extension period of four years and six months and the second extension period of one year. We are currently in the first extension period of the exploration permit, which as a result of an amendment in October 2016, ends in November 2018. In the event of commercial success, we have the right to develop and produce oil and/or gas for a period of 25 years from the grant of an exploitation authorization from the government, which may be extended for an additional period of 10 years under certain circumstances.
Suriname Exploration Agreements
In December 2011, we signed a petroleum contract covering Offshore Block 42 located offshore Suriname and are the operator. Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V. (“Staatsolie”), Suriname’s national oil company, has the option to back into the contract with an interest of not more than 10% upon approval of a development plan. The Block 42 petroleum contract provides for us to recover our share of expenses incurred (“cost recovery oil”) and our share of remaining oil (“profit oil”). Cost recovery oil is apportioned to the contractor from up to 80% of gross production prior to profit oil being split between the government of Suriname and the contractor. Profit oil is then apportioned based upon “R‑factor” tranches, where the R‑factor is cumulative net revenues divided by cumulative net investment. A corporate tax rate of 36% is applied to profits. We are in the initial period of 
30

the exploration phase, which has been extended and ends in September 2018. There are two renewal periods consisting of three years for the first renewal period and two years for the second renewal period. Each renewal period carries a one well drilling obligation. In the event of commercial success, the duration of the contract will be 30 years from the effective date or 25 years from governmental approval of a plan of development, whichever is longer. Block 42 comprises approximately 1.5 million acres (approximately 6,176 square kilometers).
In December 2011, we signed a petroleum contract covering Offshore Block 45 located offshore Suriname and are the operator. Staatsolie will be carried through the exploration and appraisal phases and has the option to back into the petroleum contract with an interest of not more than 15% upon approval of a development plan. The Block 45 petroleum contract provides for us to recover our share of expenses incurred (“cost recovery oil”) and our share of remaining oil (“profit oil”). Cost recovery oil is apportioned to the contractor from up to 80% of gross production prior to profit oil being split between the government of Suriname and the contractor. Profit oil is then apportioned based upon “R‑factor” tranches, where the R‑factor is cumulative net revenues divided by cumulative net investment. A corporate tax rate of 36% is applied to profits. We are currently in the initial period of the exploration phase, which has been extended and ends in September 2018. Following the initial period, there are two renewal periods consisting of two years each. Each renewal period carries a one well drilling obligation. In the event of commercial success, the duration of the contract will be 30 years from the effective date or 25 years from governmental approval of a plan of development, whichever is longer.
Mauritania Exploration Agreements
Effective June 2012, we entered into three petroleum contracts covering offshore Mauritania blocks C8, C12 and C13 with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. We provide technical exploration services to BP, the operator. The Mauritanian national oil company, SMHPM, currently has a 10% carried participating interest during the exploration period only. Should a commercial discovery be made, SMHPM’s 10% carried interest is extinguished and SMHPM will have an option to acquire a participating interest between 10% and 14%. SMHPM will pay its portion of development and production costs in a commercial development. Cost recovery oil is apportioned to the contractor from up to 55% of total production prior to profit oil being split between the government of Mauritania and the contractor. Profit oil is then apportioned based upon “R‑factor” tranches, where the R‑factor is cumulative net revenues divided by the cumulative investment. At the election of the government of Mauritania, the government may receive its share of production in cash or in kind. A corporate tax rate of 27% is applied to profits at the license level. The terms of exploration periods of these Offshore Blocks are all ten years and include an initial exploration period of four years followed by the first extension period of three years and the second extension period of three years. Kosmos is currently in the first extension period of the blocks, expiring in June 2019. In the event of commercial success, we have the right to develop and produce oil for 25 years and gas for 30 years from the grant of an exploitation authorization from the government, which may be extended for an additional period of 10 years under certain circumstances.
In September 2017, we acquired a 15% non-operated participating interest in Block C18 offshore Mauritania. Based on the terms of the agreement, we will reimburse a portion of past and interim period costs and partially carry Tullow’s share of a planned 3D seismic program. We will also pay Tullow $2.5 million by the end of the initial phase of the exploration period for additional carry of seismic and other joint account costs. SMHPM currently has a 10% carried participating interest during the exploration period. Should a commercial discovery be made, SMHPM’s 10% carried interest is extinguished and SMHPM will have an option to acquire a participating interest between 10% and 15%. SMHPM will pay its portion of development and production costs in a commercial development. The terms of exploration periods are ten years and include an initial exploration period of seven years from the effective date (June 15, 2012), including extensions received prior to our entry into Block 18. The first exploration phase includes a 7,600 square kilometer 3D seismic requirement, which is currently being acquired.
Senegal Exploration Agreements
In June 2015, we entered the first renewal of the exploration period for the Senegal Blocks Contract Areas, which lasts for three years. The exploration phase of each contract area may be extended to December 2020 at our election subject to our fulfilling specific work obligations including an exploration well in the final period of two and one half years. In the event of commercial success, we have the right to develop and produce oil and/or gas for a period of 25 years from the grant of an exploitation authorization from the government, which may be extended for at least one additional period of 10 years under certain circumstances.
Sao Tome and Principe Exploration Agreements
In late 2015 and early 2016, Kosmos entered into petroleum contracts for Blocks 5, 6, 11 and 12 in Sao Tome and Principe.
31

In Block 11, the Agencia Nacional Do Petroleo De Sao Tome E Príncipe ("ANP STP") has a carried 15% participating interest. The production sharing contract was awarded in July 2014, and provides for an initial exploration period of eight years with possible extensions and includes a first phase exploration period of four years followed by the second phase of two years and the third phase of two years. The block is currently in the first phase, expiring in July 2019 after receiving a one year extension in November 2017. The next exploration phases are subject to fulfillment of specific work obligations. In the event of commercial success, we have the right to develop and produce oil and/or gas for a period of 20 years from the approval of a field development program by ANP STP, which may be extended for additional periods of five years until all commercial hydrocarbons have been depleted.
In Block 6, ANP STP has a carried 10% participating interest. The production sharing contract was awarded in October 2015, and provides for an initial exploration period of eight years with possible extensions and includes a first phase exploration period of four years followed by the second phase of two years and the third phase of two years. The block is currently in the first phase, expiring in November 2019. The next exploration phases are subject to fulfillment of specific work obligations. In the event of commercial success, we have the right to develop and produce oil and/or gas for a period of 20 years from the approval of a field development program by ANP STP, which may be extended for additional periods of five years until all commercial hydrocarbons have been depleted.
In Block 5 and Block 12, ANP STP has a 15% and 12.5% carried interest , respectively. The production sharing contracts were awarded in May 2012 and February 2016, respectively, and provide for an initial exploration period of eight years with possible extensions and include a first phase exploration period of four years followed by the second phase of two years and the third phase of two years.  The blocks are currently in the first phase, expiring in May of 2019 and February 2020, respectively (the first phase of Block 5 has been extended twice for a total of 3 years).  The next exploration phases are subject to fulfillment of specific work obligations. In the event of commercial success, we have the right to develop and produce oil and/or gas for a period of 20 years from the approval of a field development program by ANP STP, which may be extended for additional periods of five years until all commercial hydrocarbons have been depleted.
Equatorial Guinea Exploration Agreements
In October 2017, we entered into petroleum contracts covering Blocks EG-21, S, and W with the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. Ratification of the petroleum contracts by the President of Equatorial Guinea is expected in early 2018. Upon ratification, we will have an 80% participating interest and will be the operator in all three blocks, but pursuant to an agreement with Trident we expect to assign a 40% participating interest in the blocks to Trident. The Equatorial Guinean national oil company, Guinea Equatorial De Petroleos ("GEPetrol"), currently has a 20% carried participating interest during the exploration period. Should a commercial discovery be made, GEPetrol's 20% carried interest will convert to a 20% participating interest. The petroleum contracts cover approximately 6,000 square kilometers, with a first exploration period of five years from the date of notification of ratification by the President of Equatorial Guinea. The first exploration period consists of two sub-periods of three and two years, respectively. The first exploration sub-period work program includes an approximately 6,000 square kilometer 3D seismic acquisition requirement across the three blocks.
Cote d'Ivoire
In December 2017, we entered into petroleum contracts covering Blocks CI-526, CI-602, CI-603, CI-707 and CI-708 with the Government of Cote d'Ivoire, and we are the operator. The Cote d'Ivoire national oil company, PETROCI Holding ("PETROCI"), currently has a 10% carried interest. The petroleum contracts cover approximately 17,000 square kilometers, with a first exploration period of three years with two possible extensions of three years each. The next exploration phases are subject to fulfillment of specific work programs. The first exploration period work program includes a 12,000 square kilometer 3D seismic acquisition across the five blocks. 
Sales and Marketing
As provided under the UUOA and the WCTP and DT petroleum contracts, we are entitled to lift and sell our share of the Jubilee and TEN production as are the other Jubilee Unit and TEN partners. We have entered into an agreement with an oil marketing agent to market our share of the Jubilee and TEN fields oil, and we approve the terms of each sale proposed by such agent. We do not anticipate entering into any long term sales agreements at this time.
In December 2017, we signed the TEN Associated-Gas Gas Sales Agreement (TAG GSA) and we expect to begin exporting TEN associated gas to shore in the second quarter of 2018. The TAG GSA provides for a sales price of $0.50 per mmbtu.

As provided under the Production Sharing Contract for Block G, KTEGI is entitled to lift and sell our share of the Ceiba Blend production as are the other Ceiba Blend partners. KTEGI has entered into an agreement with an oil marketing agent to market our share of the Ceiba Blend oil, and we approve the terms of each sale proposed by such agent. We do not anticipate entering into any long term sales agreements at this time.
There are a variety of factors which affect the market for oil, including the proximity and capacity of transportation facilities, demand for oil both within the local market and beyond, the marketing of competitive fuels and the effects of government regulations on oil production and sales. Our revenue can be materially affected by current economic conditions and the price of oil. However, based on the current demand for crude oil and the fact that alternative purchasers are available, we believe that the loss of our marketing agent and/or any of the purchasers identified by our marketing agent would not have a long‑term material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
Competition
The oil and gas industry is competitive. We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil companies in acquiring licenses. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staff that are substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable oil and natural gas assets, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of licenses than our financial or personnel resources will permit. Furthermore, these companies may also be better able to withstand the financial pressures of lower commodity prices, unsuccessful wells, volatility in financial markets and generally adverse global and industry‑wide economic conditions. These companies may also be better able to absorb the burdens resulting from changes in relevant laws and regulations, which may adversely affect our competitive position.
Historically, we have also been affected by competition for drilling rigs and the availability of related equipment. Higher commodity prices generally increase the demand for drilling rigs, supplies, services, equipment and crews. Shortages of, or increasing costs for, experienced drilling crews and equipment and services may restrict our ability to drill wells and conduct our operations.
The oil and gas industry as a whole has experienced an extended decline in crude oil prices. Dated Brent crude, the benchmark for our oil sales, ranged from approximately $44 to $67 per barrel during 2017. Excluding the impact of hedges, our realized price for 2017 was $53.73 per barrel. We believe lower prices will generally result in greater availability of assets and necessary equipment. However the impacts on the industry from a competitive perspective are not entirely known at this point.
Title to Property
Other than as specified in this annual report on Form 10‑K, we believe that we have satisfactory title to our oil and natural gas assets in accordance with standards generally accepted in the international oil and gas industry. Our licenses are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens under operating agreements and other burdens, restrictions and encumbrances customary in the oil and gas industry that we believe do not materially interfere with the use of, or affect the carrying value of, our interests.
Environmental Matters
General
We are subject to various stringent and complex international, foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing matters including the emission and discharge of pollutants into the ground, air or water; the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of regulated materials; and the health and safety of our employees. These laws and regulations may, among other things:

• | require the acquisition of various permits before operations commence;


• | enjoin some or all of the operations or facilities deemed not in compliance with permits;


• | restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and natural gas drilling, production and transportation activities;


• | limit, cap, tax or otherwise restrict emissions of GHG and other air pollutants or otherwise seek to address or minimize the effects of climate change;

33


• | limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain locations lying within protected or otherwise sensitive areas; and


• | require measures to mitigate or remediate pollution, including pollution resulting from our block partners’ or our contractors’ operations.

These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. Compliance with these laws can be costly; the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. We cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with such laws, or that environmental laws and regulations will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment continues to increase. Offshore drilling in some areas has been opposed by environmental groups and, in other areas, has been restricted. Our operations could be adversely affected to the extent laws or regulations are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts offshore drilling or imposes environmental requirements that increase costs to the oil and gas industry in general, such as more stringent or costly waste handling, disposal or cleanup requirements or financial responsibility and assurance requirements.
Capping and Containment
We entered into an agreement with a third party service provider for it to supply subsea capping and containment equipment on a global basis. The equipment includes capping stacks, debris removal, subsea dispersant and auxiliary equipment. The equipment meets industry accepted standards and can be deployed by air cargo and other conventional means to suit multiple application scenarios. We also developed an emergency response plan and response organization to prepare and demonstrate our readiness to respond to a subsea well control incident.
Oil Spill Response
To complement our agreement discussed above for subsea capping and containment equipment, we became a charter member of the Global Dispersant Stockpile. The dispersant stockpile, which is managed by Oil Spill Response Limited (“OSRL”) of Southampton, United Kingdom (“UK”), an oil spill response contractor, consists of 5,000 cubic meters of dispersant strategically located at OSRL bases around the world. The total volume of the stockpile located at the OSRL bases is calculated to provide members with the ability to respond to a major spill incident.
Mauritania and Senegal (Operated and Non-operated)
Kosmos maintains Oil Spill Contingency Plans (“OSCP”) to support our drilling operations in countries where we operate. The plans are based on the principle of “Tiered Response” to oil spills (“Guide to Tiered Response and Preparedness”, IPIECA Report Series, Volume 14, 2007).  A Tier 1 spill is defined as a small-scale operational incident which can be addressed with resources that are immediately available to us.  A Tier 2 spill is a larger incident which would need to be addressed with regionally based shared resources.  A Tier 3 spill is a large incident which would require assistance from national or world-wide spill co-operatives.  Under OSCPs, emergency response teams may be activated to respond to oil spill incidents.  The OSCPs call for Tier 1 spill equipment at our shorebases in Nouakchott, Mauritania and Dakar, Senegal to respond to a harbor or shoreline incident in the area. We also maintain dispersant spraying capabilities in the field to respond to an offshore incident. We have access to additional Tier 2 and Tier 3 equipment from OSRL’s Southampton, UK location.
Suriname
Kosmos intends to conduct drilling operations in Suriname in 2018. An OSCP has been completed per the previously mentioned “Guide to Tiered Response and Preparedness”. Kosmos plans to maintain it’s dispersant spraying capabilities in the field. We expect to have access to additional Tier 2 and Tier 3 equipment from OSRL’s Americas base in Ft Lauderdale, FL.
Ghana (Non-operated)
Tullow, our partner and the operator of the Jubilee Unit and the TEN fields, maintains an OSCP covering the Jubilee Field and Deepwater Tano Block.  Under the OSCPs, emergency response teams may be activated to respond to oil spill incidents. Tullow has access to OSRL’s oil spill response services comprising technical expertise and assistance, including access to response equipment and dispersant spraying systems. Tullow maintains lease agreements with OSRL for Tier 1 and Tier 2 packages of oil spill response equipment. Tier 1 equipment, which is stored in “ready to go trailers” for effective mobilization and deployment, includes booms and ancillaries, recovery systems, pumps and delivery systems, oil storage containers, personal protection 
34

equipment, sorbent materials, hand tools, containers and first aid equipment. Tier 2 equipment consists of larger boom and oil recovery systems, pump and delivery systems and auxiliary equipment such as generators and lighting sets, and is also containerized and pre‑packed in trailers and ready for mobilization.
Tullow has additional response capability to handle an offshore Tier 1 response. Further, our membership in the West and Central Africa Aerial Surveillance and Dispersant Spraying Service (“WACAF”) gives us access to aircraft for surveillance and spraying of dispersant, which is administered by OSRL for a Tier 2 offshore response. The aircraft is based at the Kotoka International Airport in Accra, Ghana with a contractual response time, loaded with dispersant, of six hours. Additional stockpiles of dispersant are maintained in Takoradi, Ghana. Although the above arrangement is in place, we can make no assurance that these resources will be available or respond in a timely manner as intended, perform as designed or be able to fully contain or cap any oil spill, blow‑out or uncontrolled flow of hydrocarbons. While a Tier 3 incident is not expected in Ghana, in the case of a Tier 3 incident, Tullow would engage the services of OSRL.
Per common industry practice, under agreements governing the terms of use of the drilling rigs contracted by us or our block partners, the drilling rig contractors indemnify us and our block partners in respect of pollution and environmental damage originating above the surface of the water and from such drilling rig contractor’s property, including their drilling rig and other related equipment. Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of the operating agreements for blocks in which we or our block partners are currently drilling, except in certain circumstances, each block partner is responsible for its share of liabilities in proportion to its participating interest incurred as a result of pollution and environmental damage, containment and clean‑up activities, loss or damage to any well, loss of oil or natural gas resulting from a blowout, crater, fire, or uncontrolled well, loss of stored oil and natural gas, as well as for plugging or bringing under control any well. We maintain insurance coverage typical of the industry in the areas we operate in; these include property damage insurance, loss of production insurance, wreck removal insurance, control of well insurance, general liability including pollution liability to cover pollution from wells and other operations. We also participate in an insurance coverage program for the Jubilee FPSO. Our insurance is carried in amounts typical for the industry relative to our size and operations and in accordance with our contractual and regulatory obligations.
Equatorial Guinea (Operated and Non-operated)
Kosmos recently entered into a joint venture in Equatorial Guinea through the acquisition KTIPI, which includes the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex. Our current plan is to maintain the existing capabilities to respond to a production spill. Before beginning any drilling campaign, the spill response assets will be evaluated to determine if any new equipment is necessary.
Certain Bermuda Law Considerations
As a Bermuda exempted company, we are subject to regulation in Bermuda. Among other things, we must comply with the provisions of the Bermuda Companies Act regulating the payment of dividends and making of distributions from contributed surplus.
We have been designated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority as a non‑resident for Bermuda exchange control purposes. This designation allows us to engage in transactions in currencies other than the Bermuda dollar, and there are no restrictions on our ability to transfer funds (other than funds denominated in Bermuda dollars) in and out of Bermuda or to pay dividends to United States residents who are holders of our common shares.
Under Bermuda law, “exempted” companies are companies formed for the purpose of conducting business outside Bermuda from a principal place of business in Bermuda. As an exempted company, we may not, without a license or consent granted by the Minister of Finance, participate in certain business transactions, including transactions involving Bermuda landholding rights and the carrying on of business of any kind for which we are not licensed in Bermuda.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 280 employees. None of these employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory.
Corporate Information
We were incorporated pursuant to the laws of Bermuda as Kosmos Energy Ltd. in January 2011 to become a holding company for Kosmos Energy Holdings. Kosmos Energy Holdings was formed as an exempted company limited by guarantee pursuant to the laws of the Cayman Islands in March 2004. Pursuant to the terms of a corporate reorganization that was completed simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, all of the interests in Kosmos Energy Holdings were exchanged for 
35

newly issued common shares of Kosmos Energy Ltd. and as a result, Kosmos Energy Holdings became a wholly owned subsidiary of Kosmos Energy Ltd.
We maintain a registered office in Bermuda at Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda. The telephone number of our registered offices is (441) 295‑5950.
