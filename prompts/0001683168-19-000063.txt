ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
South Beach Spirits was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 10, 2012 under the name "CME REALTY, INC." and its year-end is February 28. The Company's initial plan of operations was to engage in providing real estate services for the Las Vegas residential market. The Company was unable to implement this plan of operations for a number of reasons, including without limitation, the inability to raise sufficient capital.
 
In light of the foregoing, on February 13, 2015, Carlos Espinosa, the principal shareholder and sole director and executive officer of the Company, sold 50,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock held by him (the "CME SHARES") to Kenneth McLeod for $252,000. The CME Shares represented 74.13% of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock. Contemporaneously therewith, Mr. Espinosa resigned as an officer of the Company and appointed Mr. McLeod as a director, President and Secretary-Treasurer of the Company. Subsequently, Mr. Espinosa resigned as a director of the Company. As a result of the foregoing, a "CHANGE IN CONTROL" of the Company was deemed to have taken place.
 
On March 17, 2015, the Company implemented a five-for-one split of our common stock in the form of a stock dividend to shareholders on record at the close of business on March 9, 2015. In connection therewith, shareholders as of that date received four additional shares of the Company's common stock for each share held by them as of the record date. Unless otherwise indicated, all share numbers and per-share numbers in this report have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the March 2015 stock split.
 
On April 22, 2015, the Company entered into a letter of intent to acquire all of the capital stock of Rock N' Roll Imports, Inc., a California corporation ("RNR") engaged in alcoholic beverage development, marketing and distribution in exchange for (a) the issuance of 50,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock and (b) the contemporaneous contribution to the Company's capital of the CME Shares held by Mr. McLeod. On August 6, 2015, the Company terminated the letter of intent with RNR as a result of the inability to agree upon the terms of definitive transaction documentation.
 
On July 10, 2015, the Company approved, authorized and adopted an amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation to change its name from "CME REALTY, INC." to "SOUTH BEACH SPIRITS, INC." The name change was effective on September 9, 2015. In furtherance of its plan to focus on opportunities in developing and marketing spirts, on August 25, 2015 the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire the worldwide intellectual property and related assets of V Georgio Vodka, an ultra-premium brand of traditional and flavored vodkas from Victor G. Harvey, Sr., the brand's founder and a limited liability company owned by him, in exchange for 1,400,000 "restricted" shares of the Company's common stock and $1,000,000 in cash, payable over a scheduled payment period. In connection with the proposed transaction, 25,000,000 "RESTRICTED" shares of common stock were to be returned by the Company's principal shareholder for cancellation. A subsidiary of the Company, formed to exploit the V Georgio brand also, entered into an employment agreement with Victor G. Harvey, Sr. to serve as CEO of the subsidiary for an initial period of three years with a base salary of $120,000 per annum. The employment agreement contained confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation covenants. Subsequent thereto, the Company learned of certain breaches of material representations and warranties made by Mr. Harvey in the Asset Purchase Agreement, as well as breaches in his duties as the subsidiaries CEO. On October 13, 2015, Mr. Harvey resigned his position and the Company terminated the transaction.
 
On August 25, 2015, the Company also entered into an employment agreement with Vincent Prince, to serve as its CFO for an initial period of three years with a base salary of $120,000 per annum. The employment agreement contains confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation covenants.
 
Contemporaneously therewith, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with LandAmerica Holdings & Investments Group, LLC, and its principal Vincent Prince, for services rendered since March 1, 2015 and prior to the date of the employment agreement, with respect to business development, strategic planning, evaluating business opportunities in the alcoholic beverage industry, assisting management in structuring and potential business development opportunities, and providing such other corporate advisory consulting services as management requested. In consideration for the performance of the services, the Company has agreed to pay the consultant a fee of $175,000 for services completed on the Company's behalf.
 
On September 29, 2015, the Company authorized an increase in the number of members of the Company's Board of Directors to three, and appointed Martin D. Ustin to serve as a member of the Board until the next annual meeting or until his successor is duly elected.

On October 1, 2015, Kenneth McLeod, the Company's former President returned 25,000,000 shares of "RESTRICTED" common stock held by him to the Company for cancellation and sold 25,000,000 shares of "RESTRICTED" common stock held by him to Vincent Prince, resulting in an additional "change in control" having taken place. Contemporaneously therewith, Mr. McLeod resigned as CEO and director of the Company, but remains with the Company in a nonmanagerial position. As previously agreed upon, he converted the entire debt owed to him into 188,000 shares of the Company's common stock.
 
On October 19, 2015, the Company was served with a pro se legal action filed by Victor G. Harvey, Sr. and his wholly-owned limited liability company, V Georgio Enterprises, LLC, in Circuit Court, Broward County, Florida, alleging certain breaches of the Company's payment obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement and related agreements entered into with the Company. The complaint sought, somewhat inconsistently, injunctive relief for damages incurred by the plaintiffs because of such breaches. On December 8, 2015, the Court dismissed the complaint on various grounds, with leave to refile. The Company has been advised that the plaintiffs have refiled an amended complaint (which has not been served) with the Court.
