Item 1.    Business
Background
 
We were originally incorporated as Adelt Design, Inc. on March 31, 2011 to manufacture and market carpet binding art. Production and marketing of carpet binding art never commenced. After CLS Labs, Inc. (“CLS Labs”) acquired 55.6% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, Jeffrey Binder, the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of CLS Labs, was appointed Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Subsequently, the Company adopted amended and restated articles of incorporation, thereby changing its name to CLS Holdings USA, Inc. Our mailing address is 11767 South Dixie Highway, Suite 115, Miami, FL  33156 and our website address is www.clsholdingsinc.com. 
 
The Merger
 
On April 29, 2015, the Company entered into a merger agreement with CLS Labs and a newly-formed, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger Sub”) and effected the Merger (the “Merger”). Upon the consummation of the Merger, the separate existence of the Merger Sub ceased and CLS Labs, the surviving corporation in the Merger, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, with the Company acquiring the stock of CLS Labs, abandoning its previous business, and adopting the existing business plan and operations of CLS Labs. CLS Labs is a company that plans to generate revenues through licensing, fee-for-service and joint venture arrangements related to its patent pending proprietary method of extracting cannabinoids from cannabis plants and converting the resulting cannabinoid extracts into saleable concentrates.
Historical Operations
 
For the past four years, one of the founders of CLS Labs has been developing a proprietary method of extracting cannabinoids from cannabis plants and converting the resulting cannabinoid extracts into concentrates such as oils, waxes, edibles and shatter. These concentrates may be ingested in a number of ways, including through vaporization via e-cigarettes, and used for a variety of pharmaceutical and other purposes. Internal testing of the cannabinoids extracted through our patent-pending proprietary process versus the cannabinoids resulting from the processes commonly used in the industry, the results of which were reviewed and confirmed by an independent laboratory, has revealed that our process produces a cleaner, higher quality product and a significantly higher yield than the cannabinoid extraction processes currently existing in the marketplace.
 
On April 17, 2015, CLS Labs took its first step toward commercializing its then patent pending proprietary methods and processes by entering into the Colorado Arrangement, as described below. During 2017, we suspended our plans to proceed with the Colorado Arrangement due to regulatory delays and have not yet determined when we will pursue it again. 
 
We have recently been issued a U.S. patent with respect to our proprietary method of extracting cannabinoids from cannabis plants and converting the resulting cannabinoid extracts into concentrates such as oils, waxes, edibles and shatter. These concentrates may be ingested in a number of ways, including through vaporization via electronic cigarettes, and used for a variety of pharmaceutical and other purposes. Internal testing of this extraction method and conversion process has revealed that it produces a cleaner, higher quality product and a significantly higher yield than the cannabinoid extraction processes currently existing in the marketplace. We have not commercialized our proprietary process.  We plan to generate revenues through licensing, fee-for-service and joint venture arrangements related to our proprietary method of extracting cannabinoids from cannabis plants and converting the resulting cannabinoid extracts into saleable concentrates.
 
We intend to monetize this extraction method and generate revenues through (i) the licensing of our patent pending proprietary methods and processes to others, as in the Colorado Arrangement, (ii) the processing of cannabis for others, and (iii) the purchase of cannabis and the processing and sale of cannabis-related products.  We plan to accomplish this through the acquisition of companies, the creation of joint ventures, through licensing agreements, and through fee-for-service arrangements with growers and dispensaries of cannabis products. We believe that we can establish a position as one of the premier cannabinoid extraction and processing companies in the industry. Assuming we do so, we then intend to explore the creation of our own brand of concentrates for consumer use, which we would sell wholesale to cannabis dispensaries. We believe that we can create a “gold standard” national brand by standardizing the testing, compliance and labeling of our products in an industry currently comprised of small, local businesses with erratic and unreliable product quality, testing practices and labeling. We also plan to offer consulting services through Cannabis Life Sciences Consulting, LLC (“CLS Consulting”), which will generate revenue by providing consulting services to cannabis-related businesses, including growers, dispensaries and laboratories, and driving business to our processing facilities.

The Colorado Arrangement
 
Licensing Agreement
 
On April 17, 2015, CLS Labs Colorado entered into a Licensing Agreement with Picture Rock Holdings, LLC (“PRH”) whereby, in exchange for a license fee payable over the ten (10) year term of the agreement, CLS Labs Colorado granted to PRH an exclusive license for the State of Colorado of certain proprietary inventions and formulas relating to the extraction from, separation and processing (the “Process”) of marijuana to produce certain marijuana-infused products, including edibles, e-liquids, waxes and shatter (the “Products”), and to practice and use the Process in conjunction with the manufacture, production, sale, and distribution of the Products.
Lease and Sublease
 
In connection with the Colorado Arrangement, on April 17, 2015, pursuant to an Industrial Lease Agreement (the "Lease"), CLS Labs Colorado leased 14,392 square feet of warehouse and office space (the "Leased Real Property") in a building in Denver, Colorado where certain intended activities, including growing, extraction, conversion, assembly and packaging of cannabis and other plant materials, are permitted by and in compliance with state, city and local laws, rules, ordinances and regulations. The Lease had an initial term of seventy-two (72) months and provided CLS Labs Colorado with certain renewal options.  In August 2017, as a result of our decision to suspend our proposed operations in Colorado, CLS Labs Colorado asked its landlord to be relieved from its obligations under the Lease, but the parties have not yet reached an agreement on how to proceed. 
 
Contemporaneously with the execution of the Lease, CLS Labs Colorado entered into a Sublease Agreement with PRH, thereby subletting the entire Leased Real Property to PRH. As a result of our decision to suspend our plans to enter the Colorado market, PRH has vacated the subleased premises but the sublease remains effective.
 
Equipment Lease
 
In addition to the above-referenced Sublease, on April 17, 2015, CLS Labs Colorado and PRH entered into an Equipment Lease Agreement (the “Equipment Lease”) whereby, in exchange for a lease payment, CLS Labs Colorado agreed to commence building a fully equipped lab at the Leased Real Property, including purchasing all equipment necessary to extract, convert and provide quality control of all cannabis products of PRH. The term of the Equipment Lease was to commences upon delivery of the equipment and terminate upon the earlier of ten (10) years from its effective date or such earlier date upon which the Lease is terminated. Due to our suspension of plans to enter the Colorado market, the Equipment Lease never commenced.
The Promissory Note
 
On April 17, 2015, CLS Labs Colorado loaned Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) to PRH pursuant to a promissory note (the “Note”) to be used by PRH in connection with the financing of the building out, equipping, and development of the grow facility by PRH that will be operated by the Grower.  Pursuant to the Note, as amended by the parties effective June 30, 2015, October 31, 2015, April 11, 2016 and May 31, 2016, PRH will repay the principal due under the Note in twenty (20) equal quarterly installments of Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) commencing in the month following the month in which PRH commences generating revenue at the grow facility, which commencement is currently unknown, and continuing until paid in full. Interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the Note at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum and will be paid quarterly in arrears commencing after such initial payment and continuing until paid in full.  All outstanding principal and any accumulated unpaid interest due under the Note is due and payable on the five-year anniversary of the initial payment thereunder.  Due to the suspension of our plans to enter the Colorado market, we cannot predict when or if the Note will be paid although PRH did make one payment under the Note during the year ended May 31, 2018.
 
Acquisition of Alternative Solutions L.L.C
 
On June 27, 2018, the Company completed the purchase of all of the membership interests in Alternative Solutions L.L.C (“Alternative Solutions”) and the Oasis LLCs from the members of such entities (other than Alternative Solutions) (the “Oasis Acquisition”). The closing occurred pursuant to a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) entered into between the Company and Alternative Solutions on December 4, 2017, as amended.  Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the Company initially contemplated acquiring all of the membership interests in the Oasis LLCs from Alternative Solutions. Just prior to closing, the parties agreed that the Company would instead acquire all of the membership interests in Alternative Solutions, the parent of the Oasis LLCs, from its members, and the membership interests in the Oasis LLCs owned by members other than Alternative Solutions. The revised structure of the transaction is referenced in the Oasis Note (as defined below), which modified the Acquisition Agreement.

Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the Company paid a non-refundable deposit of $250,000 upon signing, which was followed by an additional payment of $1,800,000 paid in February 2018, for an initial 10% of each of the Oasis LLCs. At that time, the Company applied for regulatory approval to own an interest in the Oasis LLCs, which approval was received. On June 27, 2018,  the Company made the payments to indirectly acquire the remaining 90% of the Oasis LLCs, which were equal to cash in the amount of $6,200,000, a $4.0 million promissory note due in December 2019 (the “Oasis Note”), and 22,058,823 shares of common stock. The Company used the proceeds of its Special Warrant Financing to fund the cash portion of the Closing Consideration. The Company will now apply for regulatory approval to own the additional 90% in membership interests in the Oasis LLCs, which we expect to receive in due course. The change of ownership in the Oasis LLCs to the Company will be recorded upon receipt of such regulatory approvals.
 
The number of purchase price shares was equal to 80% of the offering price of the Company’ common stock in its last equity offering, which price was $0.34 per share.  The Oasis Note is secured by a first priority security interest over the membership interests in Alternative Solutions and the Oasis LLCs, as well as by the assets of the Oasis LLCs.  The Oasis Note bears interest at the rate of 6% per annum and both principal and accrued interest are due and payable in full on December 4, 2019 but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The Company also delivered a confession of judgment to a third party neutral representative of the parties that will become effective, in general, if we default under the Oasis Note.
 
Oasis currently owes certain amounts to a consultant known as 4Front Advisors, LLC.  If the Company makes any payments to this company post-closing, the Company will be entitled to deduct the present value of such payments from the principal amount due under the Oasis Note.
 
The sellers of the membership interests in Alternative Solutions are also entitled to a $1,000,000 payment from the Company on May 30, 2020 if the Oasis LLCs have maintained an average revenue of $20,000 per day during the 2019 calendar year.
 
None of the sellers of the membership interests in Alternative Solutions or the Oasis LLCs was affiliated with the Company prior to the closing.  In connection with the closing, however, the Company employed Mr. Ben Sillitoe, the CEO and a member of Alternative Solutions, as the Chief Executive Officer of CLS Nevada, Inc., and Don Decatur the COO of the Oasis LLCs as the Chief Operating Officer of CLS Nevada, Inc. 
 
Corporate Structure
 
The Company has three direct and three indirect, active, wholly-owned subsidiaries, CLS Labs and Alternative Solution are owned directly and Alternative Solutions owns 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of: (i) Serenity Wellness Center, LLC dba Oasis Cannabis (“Oasis Cannabis”); (ii) Serenity Wellness Products, LLC dba City Trees Fresh Cannabis Production, Wholesale (“City Trees Production”); and (iii) Serenity Wellness Growers, LLC dba City Trees Fresh Cannabis Cultivation, Wholesale (“City Trees Cultivation”, together with City Trees Production, “City Trees” and together with Oasis and City Trees Production, the “Oasis LLCs”). The following diagram illustrates the inter-corporate relationships of the Company, and all of the parents own 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of their subsidiaries:

Nevada Operations
 
The Company owns 100% of Alternative Solutions, which is a Nevada-based holding company that owns three separate entities with licenses to operate four different types of cannabis businesses within the State of Nevada. Oasis Cannabis, the retail trade name. Oasis currently operates a retail marijuana dispensary within walking distance to the Las Vegas Strip. Its other subsidiaries, which do business as City Trees Cultivation and City Trees Production, currently operate a small-scale cultivation and product manufacturing facility, as well as a wholesale distribution operation in North Las Vegas. Management expects that the vertically integrated business model will drive strong margins to the bottom line on a large portion of existing sales at the dispensary if and when an expansion is completed at City Trees in the fourth quarter of 2018.
 
Oasis’ retail dispensary is a single location operation in Nevada and occupies over 5,000 square feet of an over 20,000 square foot building. It intends to apply for several additional retail store licenses in September 2018 when the Nevada Department of Taxation (the “NV DOT”), its primary regulator, opens the application period from September 7th until September 20th. Although Oasis believes that it is a strong candidate to be granted additional licenses, there is no guaranty that it will be granted several or even one additional license. The existing location, which is easily accessible by tourists, is currently open 24 hours per day for walk-in customers and in-store pickup. It also delivers cannabis to residents between the hours of 10:00 AM and 8:00 PM. The central location provides logistical convenience for delivery to all parts of the Las Vegas valley.
 
City Trees’ wholesale operations, which occupies approximately 1,150 square feet of a 22,000 square foot warehouse (the “Warehouse Facility”), began sales to third parties in August 2017. It had made sales to over 25 external customers by Q2 2018. Its existing product line includes vaporizers, tinctures, capsules, and concentrates. At present, the City Trees cultivation facility only grows breeding stock to preserve valuable genetics and does not offer its crops for sale or processing, As a result, all raw materials for manufacturing are sourced from third parties.
 
We are in the preliminary stages of expanding our grow operation and implementing additional manufacturing operations using both Oasis’ existing and the Company’s patented processing methods. We intend to build out a processing facility and a grow operation to manufacture product for our retail operation. We intend to construct a multi-level grow operation in our Warehouse Facility that is expected to house up to 15,000 square feet of grow canopy. We plan to implement the build out in two phases, first with two flower rooms of approximately 1,750 square feet, then by adding a third level and building out the remaining available space in the facilities. Once it is operating at full capacity, we expect our grow operation at the Warehouse Facility to produce over 500 pounds of cannabis per month, allowing us to implement a vertically integrated model. We anticipate using state of the art LED grow lights and a vertical racking system to dramatically reduce energy costs and increase growth capacity. The Warehouse Facility also has a 34,000 square foot enclosed yard we may develop into a greenhouse in the future as doing so would further reduce raw materials and manufacturing costs by using mostly sunlight instead of electricity. As we complete the phases of the expansion of our grow operation (the “Greenhouse Expansion”) we expect to capture additional margin as we expect to purchase less of our raw materials from third parties. We estimate that completion of phase 1 and phase 2 of the Greenhouse Expansion will occur in Q1 of 2019 and Q3 of 2019, respectively.
 
Market Growth
 
According to the 2017 report compiled by ArcView Market Research, legal cannabis sales in the U.S. grew by over 37% in 2017 to $9.5 billion. This growth trend is expected to continue as more states legalize medical and retail cannabis and as more consumers choose to make legal cannabis purchases instead of buying through traditional sources. Consumers who are learning about new research supporting the health and the perceived medical benefits of cannabis will be a secondary source of strong growth in the market for the next several years.
 
Cannabis sales in Nevada have exceeded all expectations since recreational sales began on July 1, 2017. The NV DOT indicated it had exceeded its marijuana tax collection projection for the entire fiscal year after only nine months of sales.1 Management believes that the Nevada market will continue to grow at double digit rates for the next few years. This expectation is supported by sales trends in other legal markets like Colorado and Washington.

Internal Growth Strategy
 
Oasis expects to continue to grow its dispensary market share both organically and by adding additional locations within the Nevada market. Locations will be added if and when Oasis is awarded new licenses following open application periods and through strategic acquisitions in select jurisdictions in Nevada. The NV DOT announced in July 2018 that it plans to open a new application period on September 7, 2018, which will last for 10 days. It is expected that there will be up to 35 licenses awarded in Southern Nevada and up to 20 additional licenses awarded throughout other parts of the state.  Only existing license holders may apply for new licenses during this application period and Oasis believes that it will be granted a new license or licenses during this application period. There is currently a legal limitation on the number of licenses that may be issued during the upcoming licensing period. After the licenses are awarded, absent a change in legislation, the only way to obtain a new retail dispensary location in Nevada will be through acquisition.
 
Oasis plans to focus on acquisitions after the new license opportunity has passed if new locations are desired beyond what is awarded during the upcoming round of licensing. Oasis will seek to expand its footprint throughout the state in select locations with access to tourists or in residential areas with above average median income. The locations of the potential acquisitions will only matter to the extent that they are in preferable local jurisdictions. For licensing purposes, the physical location of a marijuana establishment in Nevada may be moved if it remains in the same local municipality or jurisdiction.
 
City Trees’ wholesale growth strategy relies heavily on completion of at least the first phase of the Greenhouse Expansion with secondary focus on adding new customers and increasing product line penetration at each customer’s retail location. City Trees has about 25 customers with regular recurring orders at dispensaries located throughout Nevada. Oasis currently purchases about $30,000 per month in products from City Trees, which represents only about 10% – 15% of the total retail sales. When City Trees is able to grow and release its wholesale cannabis flower, Oasis will be able to purchase about $100,000 worth of product as it replaces some of its current third party vendors with City Trees. It is expected that other existing wholesale customers will also replace some of their current suppliers’ flower with City Trees once it has become available. At present, City Trees competes with companies that grow their own raw materials. Because City Trees currently purchases raw materials from third parties, and because competition prevents City Trees from pricing its product in a manner that would generate a typical gross margin, at present, City Trees is generally unable to generate positive cash flow from its sales. Oasis expects a positive cash flow to change as the Greenhouse Expansion becomes operational.
 
Dispensary Operations
 
Oasis opened as a medical cannabis dispensary in 2015 and began retail sales to adults over the age of 21 on July 1, 2017. Customers and patients can browse the selection of inventory on display and ask questions to qualified staff with minimal wait times. Automated payments allow for safety, convenience, and scalability.
Inventory Management
 
All inventory is tracked in the state-mandated METRC seed to sale tracking system. Additionally, the Company has recently implemented MJ Platform for its point of sale and internal inventory management system. Each item is stored in a designated physical location that is also reflected in the inventory control system. All products are prepackaged before arriving at the retail store and a barcode is added to each package to ensure the proper products are fulfilled in each order. MJ Platform synchronizes its sales and inventory data with METRC for additional assurance of compliance with state mandated inventory tracking accuracy. Regular, independent inventory counts ensure that any physical variances from the tracking system are detected and addressed immediately. All product that is unusable is destroyed and logged with photo-evidence according to state regulations.
Product Selection
 
Product selections are currently managed by a team comprised of the General Manager, Assistant General Manager, and Inventory Team Leader. As Oasis adds new locations, it will form a centralized purchasing team that will ensure there is consistent product selection across all locations. The General Manager is responsible for negotiating bulk purchase discounts in conjunction with the Oasis CEO. The General Manager is also responsible for quality assurance and product mix. Each new vendor is researched, and their operations are visited whenever possible. Product samples are distributed to various employees and feedback is reviewed before making final product decisions. Oasis carries between 30 and 40 different cultivars or “strains” of cannabis flowers in addition to a wide variety of cannabis products such as vaporizers, concentrated oil, edibles, capsules, tinctures, and beverages.

Payment System
 
Payments made at Oasis are completed via both cash and electronic payment methods. All cash payments are made by customers through their use of an on-site kiosk. Electronic payments, such as those where a customer wishes to use a credit card, require an Oasis employee to load a closed loop gift card that can then be used for purchases. The kiosks operate using semi-custom and proprietary software that interfaces with the point of sale and inventory system. Oasis is in the process of implementing electronic payment methods that can be processed through a self-checkout technology as opposed to involving an Oasis employee. All cash payments are made into the kiosk, which stores the cash in a steel safe. All kiosk units are bolted to the ground and locked. By utilizing the kiosks, the exposure of operating a cash-intensive business is reduced and Oasis is able to scale and grow while minimizing labor costs associated with maintaining multiple cashiers and increasing operational efficiency.
 
Home Delivery and In-Store Pickup
 
Home delivery is currently about 15% of the total sales mix of Oasis. Customers can call or place orders online for both pickup and delivery. There is currently no fee for delivery but there are minimum order amounts based on the distance from the store. Home deliveries average well over $100 per order, which is about 75% higher than in-store orders. Oasis Cannabis is centrally located within the Las Vegas valley which makes it roughly equally distant from all areas of town. This allows the store to have a much wider geographic reach than it otherwise would. Many locals work on the Las Vegas Strip close to the store and will shop there when going to and from a shift. Offering delivery also allows them to conveniently make a purchase from Oasis without having to drive past a cannabis store that might be located closer to their homes. Many consumers prefer the convenience of home delivery and this allows Oasis to be their dispensary of choice regardless of how close they live to the store.
 
Pricing Strategy 
 
Oasis targets at least a 50% gross margin when determining pricing for any given product. Market dynamics such as supply, demand, and competitive pressure can cause variances from the target. The assistant general manager of Oasis, as part of the purchasing team, will conduct or oversee a pricing survey to determine which of the competition in close proximity carries the product and how much such competition is charging for similar products. Oasis offers a price match guarantee to minimize the risk of losing customers to competitors’ daily specials or discounts, and also sets prices to be consistent with the selection of product that is offered by competitor dispensaries in the area.
Marketing Strategy
 
Oasis Cannabis uses a variety of methods to reach consumers including billboards, paid digital static and video online ads, social media, marketing to rideshare drivers, and social engagement through a calendar of events at its community center called Community Oasis.
Cultivation, Production & Wholesale Sales Operations
 
City Trees’ wholesale operations primarily consists of purchasing finished distilled cannabis oil from third party vendors and formulating it into a variety of finished products for sales and distribution to retail cannabis stores and medical dispensaries throughout Nevada. Although City Trees has the capability to conduct extraction, conversion and processing activities, it does not presently conduct many of these activities because it is not manufacturing its own raw materials. In the future, City Trees plans to conducts these activities using both its internally developed methods as well as the Company’s patented process.
 
Due to the small size of the existing Oasis grow operation, it currently only cultivates plants for breeding and to preserve quality stock and does not harvest its plants for either production or for sale to third parties.
 
Product Line
 
City Trees offers the following product lines to its wholesale customers:
 
The vaporizer and concentrate product line consists of proprietary blends of cannabis oil and terpenes filled into custom branded City Trees vaporizers that utilize ceramic heating technology to deliver clean, even heat without using a wick like most traditional vaporizers. The City Trees product line of capsules is known as City Caps and includes CBD and THC blends in ratios of 10 to 1, 4 to 1, and 1 to 4. The blends are named CBD, Rise, and Rest, respectively.
 
 10


The recently introduced City Trees line of tinctures includes a 20 to 1, 10 to 1, and a 1 to 1 CBD to THC ratio as well as a THC only version.
 
Pricing Strategy
 
The raw materials cost inputs are very high for the current product line relative to what would be seen in a normal market. Because of competitive pressure from companies that are producing their own raw materials, City Trees has not been able to set prices high enough to achieve targeted margins in the short term. City Trees has chosen to remain very competitive with pricing in order to grow and maintain market share during its expansion project. After construction of phase 1 of the Greenhouse Expansion is completed and the Company is harvesting its own raw materials, the margins are expected to be recaptured from the third party suppliers.
Vertical Farming
 
As wholesale cannabis flower and trim moves toward becoming priced like a commodity, minimizing output costs will become more important than ever before. Wholesale price compression will reduce profitability and put many operators who are not able to grow outdoors or in greenhouses in difficult positions. Vertical farms use cubic feet instead of square feet to calculate how much space is available for cultivation. The Greenhouse Expansion construction project plans for 20-foot ceilings that can accommodate up to 3 tiers of grow canopy, essentially tripling the potential output in the building. City Trees will start with 2 tiers in most areas during phase 1 of its expansion and test 3 tiers on a smaller scale before rolling it out across the entire facility in phase 2.
 
The vertical farm will reduce electricity and rent costs per pound but has the potential to increase labor costs per pound if proper automation is not used. City Trees plans to utilize a moderate amount of automated technology to offset the potential additional labor costs. Automated watering, feeding, lighting systems are in the design phase.
 
Energy Efficient Heating & Cooling
 
In addition to using LED lights to conserve energy, City Trees plans to utilize natural gas heat pumps to minimize its heavy reliance on electricity. The units are able to heat and cool critical areas of the building using natural gas instead of relying on the already over-burdened electrical system of an indoor cultivation facility.
Single Stream Inventory
 
Nevada is different from Colorado regarding its treatment of inventory for medical and recreational customers. As long as a wholesale facility holds both a medical and a recreational license, it may sell products to dispensaries that may be sold to both recreational and medical customers. As long as the dispensary also hold both licenses, the inventory may be sold to either type of customer as long as it came from a wholesale company with both license types. This reduces logistical challenges that would otherwise arise from having two separate streams of inventory to service the medical and adult-use segments.
Licenses
 
A Retail Marijuana Store License or Medical Marijuana Dispensary Registration Certificate allows for the sale of cannabis products to the applicable end consumer. A company must hold both licenses to be able to sell products to both types of consumers. A retail marijuana store may also deliver to residents in Nevada without any additional licensing. Both local and state licenses are required.
 
A Retail (adult-use or recreational) Marijuana Cultivation or Medical Marijuana Cultivation Registration Certificate allows the holder to grow as much cannabis as it can in its approved production space. There is no limitation to the number of plants that maybe be grown at any time. The state only approves the production space regarding compliance, not size.
 
A Retail (adult-use or recreational) Marijuana Product Manufacturing license or Medical Marijuana Production Registration Certificate allows for the extraction, conversion, and manufacturing of raw cannabis material into finished consumer packaged goods. The NV Department of Taxation must approve all formulas, processes, equipment, products, and packaging prior to any manufacturing or sales.
 
 11


A Retail (adult-use or recreational) Marijuana Distributor License allows licensees to deliver wholesale products from a cultivator or manufacturer to a retail store. This is only a requirement for products that could be sold to recreational customers. Many vertically integrated operators are forced to use third party distributors to deliver products from their wholesale facilities to their own stores and to other customers. City Trees holds one of only 29 distributor licenses that exist to serve the more than 60 dispensaries and 195 wholesalers in the State. Oasis is licensed to operate in the city of Las Vegas as a Dual Use Marijuana Business, and in the State of Nevada as a Medical Marijuana Dispensary Establishment and a Retail Marijuana Store. City Trees Production is licensed to operate in the state of Nevada as a Medical Marijuana Production Establishment, a Retail Marijuana Product Manufacturing facility and a Retail Marijuana Distributor. City Trees Production is also licensed to operate in the state of Nevada as a Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility and a Retail Marijuana Cultivator. Please see “United States Regulatory Environment – Oasis LLC Licenses” for a complete list of state and local licenses held by the Oasis LLCs.
 
Specialized Skill & Knowledge
 
Commercial cannabis cultivation requires access to employees with specialized skills and knowledge in order to maximize harvest quality and yield in addition to having the capacity for developing new varieties. Botanical extraction of concentrated oils, product formulation and product manufacturing each require their own specific sets of specialized skill and knowledge to ensure maximization of yields and quality from extraction and to create consistent, high quality products. Additionally, the operation of a quality retail cannabis store requires extensive product knowledge to provide the optimal experience for customers. Each of these operations requires extensive knowledge and understanding of the Nevada regulatory landscape to ensure compliance with all local and state laws and regulations.
 
The COO of CLS Nevada, Inc has gained important skills and knowledge through experience with all areas needed to run a successful cultivation operation. He expects to continue to develop unique, new strains that are only available to City Trees and will build on the current knowledge of the organization through testing new techniques and technologies in a small research and development room within the cultivation facility. His previous experience along with independent consultation, is the basis for Oasis’ proprietary standard operating procedures that we believe will ensure consistent quality and yield performance. He has practical experience with the extraction of cannabis including no-solvent, butane, carbon dioxide and the finishing of the extracts into consumer-packaged goods.
 
The extraction / product formulation team includes employees with hands on experience in cannabis extraction and product manufacturing in addition to employees with undergraduate chemistry degrees and limited experience in cannabis extraction. This provides access to both the technical and hands-on applications of knowledge that benefits product formulation in addition to extraction efficiency and productivity.
 
The leadership at Oasis is knowledgeable in all the products available in the United States market because the leadership at Oasis has operated in Nevada since the beginning of medical cannabis sales.
 
The Company conducts ongoing training to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations. The leadership of each business unit attends regular compliance training conducted by local and state officials which provides content and updates for internal training.
 
In addition to the Company’s internal resources, there is a broad market of skilled employees with cannabis knowledge and experience in Nevada to facilitate growth of the labor force.
 
Competitive Conditions
 
The Company currently operates in the Nevada cannabis market, which has limited licensing opportunities for retail locations in accordance with state regulations. There is currently no legal limitation on the number of cultivation and product manufacturing licenses that may be issued and there is no limitation on how much can be grown or produced with those licenses. These conditions create significant barriers to entry for new competition.
 
The limitation on the number of licenses available for retail creates a significant barrier to entry for potential competition in the retail cannabis market. Prospective competitors will not be able to acquire any of the currently proposed new licenses unless they are operating in Nevada. This leaves acquisition as the only method available for most companies to enter the state’s retail cannabis market absent changes in legislation. There is also a 10% legal limitation on the number of retail licenses that may be owned by any one entity within a given county. The size and number of locations in a potential acquisition are limited as a result. These conditions mitigate the risk of losing market share to new companies entering the Nevada retail market.
 
Nevada wholesale prices have increased since recreational sales began as a result of a demand spike being met with a limited supply. Expansion projects, like the City Trees cultivation facility, have been completed or are underway to meet the additional demand. Most of the additional supply is coming from existing players within the market as very few new cultivation licenses have been issued. The ability to expand facilities without limitation will allow the market to reach an equilibrium wholesale price point without the need to license additional operators. Although there is no legal limitation on cultivation and production licenses, we do not currently anticipate that new licenses will be issued.

Components
 
Raw materials for processing and manufacturing are available from a variety of sources. Oasis maintains relationships with various suppliers for each key component of the raw materials to mitigate vendor concentration risk. City Trees wholesale operations is the sole purchaser of raw materials within the organization because the retail operation only stocks finished consumer packaged products. All raw materials are currently purchased from third parties. City Trees is expected to be able to supply a large portion of the raw cannabis material upon completion of phase 1 of the Greenhouse Expansion, but certain items will always come from third parties.  The following table describes the key components of the supply chain for City Trees products:

Patents and Trademarks
 
The Company has developed extraction and processing methods that are proprietary and, on April 24, 2018, the Company (via CLS Labs) was awarded a non-provisional U.S. utility patent for cannabidiol extraction and conversion process by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (U.S. patent number 9,950,976 B1). The patent is expected to result in market-changing product consistency, cost savings for growers, and increased anticipated revenues for us due to the larger amount of Delta-9 THC that we believe we can produce through our patent pending proprietary process. We expect to use a version of the patented technology on a smaller scale in connection with the Greenhouse Expansion.

Growth Strategy
 
Our growth strategy includes the following plans:
 
●         Securing capital for the construction of processing centers.
 
●         Obtaining the necessary state and local licensure for each proposed facility.
 
●         Securing initial licensing, processing or sales arrangements, as applicable, with growers and dispensaries. Such arrangements may result from marketing efforts, relationships within the industry or the CLS Consulting business.
 
●         Constructing processing facilities.  
 
●         Expanding per-facility capacity and increasing revenues.
 
●         Developing a national brand of cannabis concentrates, which will be sold wholesale to dispensaries, through standardization of the testing, compliance and labeling process.
 
We may also grow by acquiring existing cannabis industry companies that will benefit from the use of our proprietary technology as well as other companies in the cannabis industry that are compatible with our proposed operations, including but not limited to completion of the proposed Pure Harvest transaction.
 
Regulation and Licensure
 
Despite 30 states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam having legalized or decriminalized marijuana use for medical purposes, the prescription, use and possession of marijuana remains illegal under federal law. As such, although we will only operate processing facilities in states that permit the possession, sale and use of cannabis, certain activities of our business, including the possession of cannabis for processing and the sale of cannabis concentrates, will be in violation of federal law.
 
The Company, through the Oasis LLCs, is directly involved in the cultivation, distribution and sale of cannabis in the State of Nevada. All of the Company’s operations are in the United States. Therefore, the Company’s balance sheet and operating statement exposure to U.S. marijuana-related activities is 100%.
 
Enforcement of United States Federal Laws
 
In the United States, cannabis is highly regulated at the state level. To the Company’s knowledge, there are to date a total of 30 states, plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam that have legalized medical cannabis in some form although not all states have fully implemented their legalization programs. Nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for adult use. Fifteen additional states have legalized high-cannabidol (CBD), low Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) oils for a limited class of patients. Notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment of cannabis at the state level, cannabis continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (codified in 21 U.S.C.A. Section 812). Under United States federal law, a Schedule I drug is considered to have a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for the use of the substance under medical supervision. Federal law prohibits commercial production and sale of all Schedule I controlled substances, and as such, cannabis-related activities, including without limitation, the importation, cultivation, manufacture, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis that remain illegal under U.S. federal law. It is also illegal to aid or abet such activities or to conspire or attempt to engage in such activities. Strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under U.S. federal law, nor provide a defense to any federal proceeding brought against the Company. An investor’s contribution to and involvement in such activities may result in federal civil and/or criminal prosecution, including, but not limited to, forfeiture of his, her or its entire investment, fines and/or imprisonments.

As a result of the conflicting views between state legislatures and the federal government regarding cannabis, investments in, and the operations of, cannabis businesses in the U.S. are subject to inconsistent laws and regulations. The so-called “Cole Memorandum” or “Cole Memo” issued by former Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013 and other Obama-era cannabis policy guidance, discussed below, provided the framework for managing the tension between federal and state cannabis laws. Subsequently, as discussed below, Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memo and related policy guidance. Although no longer in effect, these policies, and the enforcement priorities established within, appear to continue to be followed during the Trump administration and remain critical factors that inform the past and future trend of state-based legalization.
 
The Cole Memo directed U.S. Attorneys not to prioritize the enforcement of federal cannabis laws against individuals and businesses that comply with state medical or adult-use cannabis regulatory programs, provided certain enumerated enforcement priorities (such as diversion or sale of cannabis to minors) were not implicated. In addition to general prosecutorial guidance issued by the DOJ, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued a memorandum on February 14, 2014 outlining Bank Secrecy Act-compliant pathways for financial institutions to service state-sanctioned cannabis businesses, which echoed the enforcement priorities outlined in the Cole Memo (the “FinCEN Memorandum” or “FinCEN Memo”). On the same day the FinCEN Memorandum was published, the DOJ issued complimentary policy guidance directing prosecutors to apply the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memo when determining whether to prosecute individuals or institutions with crimes related to financial transactions involving the proceeds of cannabis-related activities (the “Cole Banking Memorandum”).
 
On January 4, 2018 Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memo, the Cole Banking Memorandum, and all other related Obama-era DOJ cannabis enforcement guidance. While the rescission did not change federal law, as the Cole Memo and other DOJ guidance documents were not themselves laws, the rescission removed the DOJ’s formal policy that state-regulated cannabis businesses in compliance with the Cole Memo guidelines should not be a prosecutorial priority. Notably, Attorney General Sessions’ rescission of the Cole Memo and the Cole Banking Memorandum has not affected the status of the FinCEN Memorandum issued by the Department of Treasury, which remains in effect. In addition to his rescission of the Cole Memo, Attorney General Sessions issued a one-page memorandum known as the “Sessions Memorandum.” The Sessions Memorandum explains the DOJ’s rationale for rescinding all past DOJ cannabis enforcement guidance, claiming that Obama-era enforcement policies are “unnecessary” due to existing general enforcement guidance adopted in the 1980s, in chapter 9.27.230 of the U.S. Attorney’s Manual (the “USAM”). The USAM enforcement priorities, like those of the Cole Memo, are based on the use of the federal government’s limited resources and include “law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General,” the “seriousness” of the alleged crimes, the “deterrent effect of criminal prosecution,” and “the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.” Although the Sessions Memorandum emphasizes that cannabis is a federally illegal Schedule I controlled substance, it does not otherwise instruct U.S. Attorneys to consider the prosecution of cannabis-related offenses a DOJ priority, and in practice, most U.S. Attorneys have not changed their prosecutorial approach to date. However, due to the lack of specific direction in the Sessions Memorandum as to the priority federal prosecutors should ascribe to such cannabis activities, there can be no assurance that the federal government will not seek to prosecute cases involving cannabis businesses that are otherwise compliant with state law. See “Risk Factors”.
 
Such potential proceedings could involve significant restrictions being imposed upon the Company or third parties, and also divert the attention of key executives. Such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, revenues, operating results and financial condition as well as the Company’s reputation, even if such proceedings were concluded successfully in favour of the Company. See “Risk Factors”.
 
For the reasons set forth above, the Company’s existing operations in the United States, and any future operations or investments the Company may engage in, may become the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators, stock exchanges and other authorities in Canada. As a result, the Company may be subject to significant direct and indirect interaction with public officials. There can be no assurance that this heightened scrutiny will not in turn lead to the imposition of certain restrictions on the Company’s ability to operate in the United States or any other jurisdiction. See “Risk Factors”.
 
Government policy changes or public opinion may also result in a significant influence over the regulation of the cannabis industry in the United States or elsewhere. A negative shift in the public’s perception of medical cannabis in the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction could affect future legislation or regulation. Among other things, such a shift could cause state jurisdictions to abandon initiatives or proposals to legalize medical cannabis, thereby limiting the number of new state jurisdictions into which the Company could expand. Any inability to fully implement the Company’s expansion strategy may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. See “Risk Factors”.
 
 16


Further, violations of any federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civil proceedings conducted by either the federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, cessation of business activities or divestiture. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including its reputation and ability to conduct business, its holding (directly or indirectly) of medical cannabis licenses in the United States, the listing of its securities on various stock exchanges, its financial position, operating results, profitability or liquidity or the market price of its publicly traded shares. In addition, it is difficult for the Company to estimate the time or resources that would be needed for the investigation of any such matters or its final resolution because, in part, the time and resources that may be needed are dependent on the nature and extent of any information requested by the applicable authorities involved, and such time or resources could be substantial. See “Risk Factors”.
 
United States Enforcement Proceedings
 
An appropriations rider contained in the fiscal year 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Acts (formerly known as the “Rohrabacher-Farr” Amendment; now known as the “Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment” and currently proposed for the next appropriations rider as the “Joyce Amendment”, referred to herein as the “Amendment”) provides budgetary constraints on the federal government’s ability to interfere with the implementation of state-based medical cannabis laws. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and other courts have interpreted the language to mean that the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) cannot expend funds to prosecute state-law-abiding medical cannabis operators complying strictly with state medical cannabis laws. The Amendment prohibits the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to prevent states from implementing their own medical cannabis laws. The Amendment remains in effect through September 30, the end of the 2018 fiscal year, at which point Congress will decide whether to approve its extension. Continued reauthorization of the Amendment is predicated on future political developments and cannot be guaranteed. If the Amendment expires, federal prosecutors could prosecute even state-compliant medical cannabis operators for conduct within the five-year statute of limitations. The Amendment does not protection to state legal adult-use cannabis businesses and the DOJ may spend funds to prosecute persons that are operating in accordance with state adult use cannabis laws.
Ability to Access Public and Private Capital
 
The Company has historically, and continues to have, access to equity and debt financing from the public and prospectus exempt (private placement) markets in Canada. The Company’s executive team and board of directors of the Company also have extensive relationships with sources of private capital (such as funds and high net worth individuals), that could be investigated at a higher cost of capital. If such equity and/or debt financing was no longer available in the public markets in Canada due to changes in applicable law, then the Company expects that it would have access to raise equity and/or debt financing privately.
 
Although the Company is not able to obtain bank financing in the U.S. or financing from other U.S. federally regulated entities, it currently has access to equity financing through the public markets in Canada. Since the use of marijuana is illegal under U.S. federal law, and in light of concerns in the banking industry regarding money laundering and other federal financial crime related to marijuana, U.S. banks have been reluctant to accept deposit funds from businesses involved with the marijuana industry. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry often have difficulty finding a bank willing to accept their business. Likewise, marijuana businesses have limited, if any, access to credit card processing services. As a result, marijuana businesses in the U.S. are largely cash-based. This complicates the implementation of financial controls and increases security issues.
 
Commercial banks, private equity firms and venture capital firms have approached the cannabis industry cautiously to date. However, there are increasing numbers of high net worth individuals and family offices that have made meaningful investments in companies and projects similar to the Company’s projects. Although there has been an increase in the amount of private financing available over the last several years, there is neither a broad nor deep pool of institutional capital that is available to cannabis license holders and license applicants. There can be no assurance that additional financing, if raised privately, will be available to the Company when needed or on terms which are acceptable. The Company’s inability to raise financing to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions could limit its growth and may have a material adverse effect upon future profitability. See “Risk Factors – Additional Financing”.
 
State-Level Overview
 
The following sections present an overview of market and regulatory conditions for the marijuana industry in the state of Nevada, in which the Company has an operating presence in, and is presented as of August 2018, unless otherwise indicated. Although the Company’s activities are compliant with applicable United States state and local law, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under United States federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company.

Nevada Summary
 
Nevada has a medical marijuana program and passed an adult-use legalization through the ballot box in November 2016. In 2000, Nevada voters passed an amendment to the Nevada state constitution allowing physicians to recommend cannabis for an inclusive set of qualifying conditions including chronic pain and created a limited non-commercial medical marijuana patient/caregiver system. Senate Bill 374, which passed the legislature and was signed by the Governor in 2013, expanded this program and established a for-profit regulated medical marijuana industry.
 
The Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health licensed medical marijuana establishments up until July 1, 2017 when the state’s medical marijuana program merged with adult-use marijuana enforcement under the NV DOT. In 2014, Nevada accepted medical marijuana business applications and a few months later the Division approved 182 cultivation licenses, 118 licenses for the production of edibles and infused products, 17 independent testing laboratories, and 55 medical marijuana dispensary licenses. The number of dispensary licenses was then increased to 66 by legislative action in 2015. The application process is merit-based, competitive, and is currently closed. Residency is not required to own or invest in a Nevada medical cannabis business. In addition, vertical integration is neither required nor prohibited. Nevada’s medical law includes patient reciprocity, which permits medical patients from other states to purchase marijuana from Nevada dispensaries. Nevada also allows for dispensaries to deliver medical marijuana to patients.
 
Each medical marijuana establishment must register with the NV DOT and apply for a medical marijuana establishment registration certificate. Among other requirements, there are minimum liquidity requirements and restrictions on the geographic location of a medical marijuana establishment as well as restrictions relating to the age and criminal background of employees, owners, officers and board members of the establishment. All employees must be over 21 and all owners, officers and board members must not have any previous felony convictions or had a previously granted medical marijuana registration revoked. Additionally, each volunteer, employee, owner, officer and board member of a medical marijuana establishment must be registered with the NV DOT as a medical marijuana agent and hold a valid medical marijuana establishment agent card. The establishment must have adequate security measures and use an electronic verification system and inventory control system. If the proposed medical marijuana establishment will sell or deliver edible marijuana products or marijuana-infused products, proposed operating procedures for handling such products which must be preapproved by the NV DOT.
 
In determining whether to issue a medical marijuana establishment registration certificate pursuant to NRS 453A.322, the NV DOT, in addition the application requirements set out, considers the following criteria of merit:
 

(a) | the total financial resources of the applicant, both liquid and illiquid;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | the previous experience of the persons who are proposed to be owners, officers or board members of the proposed medical marijuana establishment at operating other businesses or non- profit organizations;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | the educational achievements of the persons who are proposed to be owners, officers or board members of the proposed medical marijuana establishment;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | any demonstrated knowledge or expertise on the part of the persons who are proposed to be owners, officers or board members of the proposed medical marijuana establishment with respect to the compassionate use of marijuana to treat medical conditions;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(e) | whether the proposed location of the proposed medical marijuana establishment would be convenient to serve the needs of persons who are authorized to engage in the medical use of marijuana;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(f) | the likely impact of the proposed medical marijuana establishment on the community in which it is proposed to be located;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(g) | the adequacy of the size of the proposed medical marijuana establishment to serve the needs of persons who are authorized to engage in the medical use of marijuana;
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(h) | whether the applicant has an integrated plan for the care, quality and safekeeping of medical marijuana from seed to sale;
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(i) | the amount of taxes paid to, or other beneficial financial contributions made to, the State of Nevada or its political subdivisions by the applicant or the persons who are proposed to be owners, officers or board members of the proposed medical marijuana establishment; and
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(j) | any other criteria of merit that the Division determines to be relevant.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A medical marijuana establishment registration certificate expires 1 year after the date of issuance and may be renewed upon resubmission of the application information and renewal fee to the NV DOT.
 
Adult-Use Retail Marijuana Program
 
The sale of marijuana for adult-use in Nevada was approved by ballot initiative on November 8, 2016 and Nevada Revised Statute 453D exempts a person who is 21 years of age or older from state or local prosecution for possession, use, consumption, purchase, transportation or cultivation of certain amounts of marijuana and requires the NV DOT to begin receiving applications for the licensing of marijuana establishments on or before January 1, 2018. The legalization of retail marijuana does not change the medical marijuana program.
 
In February 2017, the Nevada Department of Taxation announced plans to issue “early start” recreational marijuana establishment licenses in the summer of 2017. These licenses, beginning on July 1, 2017, allowed marijuana establishments holding both a retail marijuana store and dispensary license to sell their existing medical marijuana inventory as either medical or adult-use marijuana, and expired at the end of the year. Starting July 1, 2017, medical and adult-use marijuana have incurred a 15% excise tax on the first wholesale sale (calculated on the fair market value) and adult-use cannabis have incurred an additional 10% special retail marijuana sales tax in addition to any general state and local sales and use taxes.
 
On January 16, 2018, the Marijuana Enforcement Division of the NV DOT issued final rules governing its adult-use marijuana program, pursuant to which up to sixty-six (66) permanent adult-use marijuana dispensary licenses will be issued. Existing adult-use marijuana licensees under the “early start” regulations must re-apply for licensure under the permanent rules in order to continue adult-use sales.
 
Under Nevada’s adult-use marijuana law, the NV DOT licenses marijuana cultivation facilities, product manufacturing facilities, distributors, retail stores and testing facilities. After merging medical and adult-use marijuana regulation and enforcement, the single regulatory agency is now known as the “Marijuana Enforcement Division of the Department of Taxation.” For the first 18 months, applications to the Department for adult-use establishment licenses can only be accepted from existing medical marijuana establishment certificate holders and existing liquor distributors for the adult-use distribution license. In November 2018, the NV DOT may open up the application process to those not holding a medical marijuana establishment certificate.
 
There are five types of retail marijuana establishment licenses under Nevada's retail marijuana program:
 

1. | Cultivation Facility - licensed to cultivate (grow), process, and package marijuana; to have marijuana tested by a testing facility; and to sell marijuana to retail marijuana stores, to marijuana product manufacturing facilities, and to other cultivation facilities, but not to consumers.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Distributor - licensed to transport marijuana from a marijuana establishment to another marijuana establishment. For example, from a cultivation facility to a retail store.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Product Manufacturing Facility - licensed to purchase marijuana; manufacture, process, and package marijuana and marijuana products; and sell marijuana and marijuana products to other product manufacturing facilities and to retail marijuana stores, but not to consumers. Marijuana products include things like edibles, ointments, and tinctures.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Testing Facility - licensed to test marijuana and marijuana products, including for potency and contaminants.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Retail Store - licensed to purchase marijuana from cultivation facilities, marijuana and marijuana products from product manufacturing facilities, and marijuana from other retail stores; can sell marijuana and marijuana products to consumers.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Administration of the regular retail program in Nevada will be governed by permanent regulations, currently being drafted by the NV DOT. The NV DOT has been conducting public consultation and receiving public comments on the Revised Proposed Adult-Use Marijuana Regulation (LCB File No. R092-17) dated December 13, 2017 (the "Nevada Adult-Use Regulation"). On February 27, 2018, the NV DOT adopted the Nevada Adult- Use Regulations and the NV DOT is now seeking applications for adult-use marijuana or medical marijuana registration certificates.
 
License and Regulations 
 
In the state of Nevada, only cannabis that is grown or produced in the state by a licensed establishment may be sold in the state. The Nevada regulatory regime is not a vertically integrated system and only permits the holder of a retail dispensary license and registration certificate to purchase marijuana from cultivation facilities, marijuana and marijuana products from product manufacturing facilities and marijuana from other retail stores, and allows the sale of marijuana and marijuana products to consumers.
 
 19


A medical cultivation license permits its holder to acquire, possess, cultivate, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries, facilities for the production of edible medical marijuana products and/or medical marijuana-infused products, or other medical marijuana cultivation facilities.
 
The medical product manufacturing license permits its holder to acquire, possess, manufacture, deliver, transfer, transport, supply, or sell edible marijuana products or marijuana infused products to other medical marijuana production facilities or medical marijuana dispensaries.
 
Reporting Requirements
 
The state of Nevada uses a computerized track and trace system used to track commercial cannabis activity and seed-to-sale. Individual licensees whether directly or through third-party integration systems are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. See “Compliance with Applicable State Law in the United States”.
 
Storage and Security
 
To ensure the safety and security of cannabis business premises and to maintain adequate controls against the diversion, theft, and loss of cannabis or cannabis products, Nevada state law requires the following:

(a) | be an enclosed, locked facility;
----+---------------------------------


(b) | have a single secure entrance;
----+-------------------------------


(c) | train employees in security measures and controls, emergency response protocol, confidentiality requirements, safe handling of equipment, procedures for handling products, as well as the differences in strains, methods of consumption, methods of cultivation, methods of fertilization and methods for health monitoring;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | install security equipment to deter and prevent unauthorized entrances, which includes:
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


a. | devices that detect unauthorized intrusion which may include a signal system; and

---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c. | video cameras with a recording resolution of at least 704 x 480 which provides coverage of all entrances to and exits from limited access areas and all entrances to and exits from the building and which can identify any activity occurring in or adjacent to the building;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


d. | a video camera at each point-of-sale location which allows for the identification of any person who holds a valid registry identification card, including, without limitation, a designated primary caregiver, purchasing medical marijuana;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


e. | a video camera in each grow room which can identify any activity occurring within the grow room in low light conditions;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


f. | a method for storing video recordings from the video cameras for at least thirty (30) calendar days;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


g. | a failure notification system that provides an audible and visual notification of any failure in the electronic monitoring system;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


h. | sufficient battery backup for video cameras and recording equipment to support at least five (5) minutes of recording in the event of a power outage; and
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


i. | security alarm to alert local law enforcement of unauthorized breach of security; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(f) | implement security procedures that:

f. | require and explain the use of automatic or electronic notification to alert local law enforcement of an unauthorized breach of security.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transportation
 
In Nevada, marijuana may only be transported from a licensed grow or production facility by a licensed marijuana distributor. Prior to transporting the marijuana or marijuana products, the distributor must complete a trip plan which includes: the agent name and registration number providing and receiving the marijuana; the date and start time of the trip; a description, including the amount, of the marijuana or marijuana products being transported; and the anticipated route of transportation.
 
During the transportation of marijuana or marijuana products, the licensed marijuana distributor agent must: (a) carry a copy of the trip plan with him or her for the duration of the trip; (b) have his or her marijuana establishment agent card in his or her immediate possession; (c) use a vehicle without any identification relating to marijuana and which is equipped with a secure lockbox or locking cargo area which must be used for the sanitary and secure transportation of marijuana, or marijuana products; (d) have a means of communicating with the marijuana establishment for which he or she is providing the transportation; and (e) ensure that all marijuana or marijuana products are not visible. After transporting marijuana or marijuana products a licensed marijuana distributor agent must enter the end time of the trip and any changes to the trip plan that was completed.
 
Each licensed marijuana distributor agent transporting marijuana or marijuana products must report any: (a) vehicle accident that occurs during the transportation to a person designated by the marijuana distributor to receive such reports within two (2) hours after the accident occurs; and (b) loss or theft of marijuana or marijuana products that occurs during the transportation to a person designated by the marijuana distributor to receive such reports immediately after the marijuana establishment agent becomes aware of the loss or theft. A marijuana distributor that receives a report of loss or theft pursuant to this paragraph must immediately report the loss or theft to the appropriate law enforcement agency and to the NV DOT. The distributor must report any unauthorized stop that lasts longer than two (2) hours to the NV DOT.
 
A marijuana distributor shall maintain the required documents and provide a copy of the documents required to the NV DOT for review upon request. Each marijuana distributor shall maintain a log of all received reports.
 
Employees of licensed marijuana distributors, including drivers transporting marijuana and marijuana products, must be 21 years of age or older and must obtain a valid marijuana establishment agent registration card issued by the NV DOT. If a marijuana distributor is co-located with another type of business, all employees of co-located businesses must have marijuana establishment agent registration cards unless the co-located business does not include common entrances, exits, break room, restrooms, locker rooms, loading docks, and other areas as are expedient for business and appropriate for the site as determined and approved by Department inspectors. While engaged in the transportation of marijuana and marijuana products, any person that occupies a transport vehicle when it is loaded with marijuana or marijuana products must have their physical marijuana establishment agent registration card in their possession.
 
All drivers must carry in the vehicle valid driver’s insurance at the limits required by the State of Nevada and the NV DOT. All drivers must be bonded in an amount sufficient to cover any claim that could be brought, or disclose to all parties that their drivers are not bonded. Marijuana establishment agent registration cardholders and the licensed marijuana distributor they work for are responsible for the marijuana and marijuana product once they takes control of the product and leave the premises of the marijuana establishment.
 
There is no load limit on the amount or weight of marijuana and marijuana products that are being transported by a licensed marijuana distributor. Marijuana distributors are required to adhere to NV DOT regulations and those required through their insurance coverage. When transporting by vehicle, marijuana and marijuana product must be in a lockbox or locked cargo area. A trunk of a vehicle is not considered secure storage unless there is no access from within the vehicle and it is not the same key access as the vehicle. Live plants can be transported in a fully enclosed, windowless locked trailer or secured area inside the body/compartment of a locked van or truck so that they are not visible to the outside. If the value of the marijuana and marijuana products being transported by vehicle is in excess of $10,000 (the insured value per the shipping manifest), the transporting vehicle must be equipped with a car alarm with sound or have no less than two (2) of the marijuana distributor’s marijuana establishment agent registration cardholders involved in the transportation. All marijuana and marijuana product must be tagged for purposes of inventory tracking with a unique identifying label as required by the NV DOT and remain tagged during transport. This unique identifying label should be similar to the stamp for cigarette distribution. All marijuana and marijuana product when transported by vehicle must be transported in sealed packages and containers and remain unopened during transport. All marijuana and marijuana product transported by vehicle should be inventoried and accounted for in the inventory tracking system. Loading and unloading of marijuana and marijuana products from the transporting vehicle must be within view of existing video surveillance systems prior to leaving the origination location. Security requirements are required for the transportation of marijuana and marijuana products.

Oasis LLC Licenses
 
Oasis is licensed to operate in the City of Las Vegas as a Dual Use Marijuana Business, and in the State of Nevada as a Medical Marijuana Dispensary Establishment and a Retail Marijuana Store. City Trees Production is licensed to operate in the state of Nevada as a Medical Marijuana Production Establishment, a Retail Marijuana Product Manufacturing facility and a Retail Marijuana Distributor. City Trees Production is licensed to operate in the state of Nevada as a Medical Marijuana Cultivation Facility and a Retail Marijuana Cultivator. The table below lists the licenses issued to the Oasis LLCs in respect of the Oasis LLCs’ operations in Nevada (including municipal licenses). Under applicable laws, the licenses permit the Oasis LLCs to cultivate, manufacture, process, package, sell, and purchase marijuana pursuant to the terms of the licenses, which are issued by the NV DOT under the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes section 453A, 453D, their associated sections of the Nevada Administrative Code and local regulations pertaining to cannabis businesses. All provisional licenses owned by Oasis are, as of the date hereof, active with the state of Nevada. All licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at the Oasis LLCs facilities in Nevada.
 
All marijuana establishments must register with the NV DOT. If applications contain all required information and after vetting by officers, establishments are issued a medical marijuana establishment registration certificate. In a local governmental jurisdiction that issues business licenses, the issuance by the NV DOT of a medical marijuana establishment registration certificate is considered provisional until the local government has issued a business license for operation and the establishment is in compliance with all applicable local governmental ordinances. Final registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. Renewal requests are typically communicated through email from NV DOT and include a renewal form. The renewal periods serve as an update for NV DOT on the licensee’s status toward active licensure. Maintaining the licenses in good standing is critical to the success of a marijuana business in Nevada. Failure to adhere to the regulations can result in significant fines and penalties, including the suspension or revocation of the license.
 
The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at Oasis LLC facilities. The table below lists the licenses issued to the Oasis LLCs in respect of their operations in Nevada.

Nevada License and regulations
 
The retail dispensary licenses permit the Oasis LLCs to purchase marijuana from Nevada licensed cultivation facilities, marijuana and marijuana products from Nevada licensed product manufacturing facilities and marijuana from other Nevada licensed retail stores, and allows the sale of marijuana and marijuana products to consumers. No marijuana or marijuana infused products may be brought into Nevada from outside of Nevada. Unlicensed marijuana activities are subject to harsh criminal penalties under Nevada state law.
 
The medical cultivation licenses permit the Oasis LLCs to acquire, possess, cultivate, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to Nevada licensed medical marijuana dispensaries, facilities for the production of edible medical marijuana products and/or medical marijuana-infused products, or other medical marijuana cultivation facilities.
 
The medical product manufacturing license permits the Oasis LLCs to acquire, possess, manufacture, deliver, transfer, transport, supply, or sell edible marijuana products or marijuana infused products to other Nevada licensed medical marijuana production facilities or medical marijuana dispensaries.
 
Nevada Reporting Requirements
 
The state of Nevada uses METRC as the state’s computerized T&T system for seed-to-sale. Individual licensees whether directly or through third-party integration systems are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. The Oasis LLCs have designated an in-house computerized seed to sale software that integrate with METRC via API (GreenBits), which captures the required data points for cultivation, manufacturing and retail as required in Nevada Revised Statutes section 453A.
Compliance with Applicable State Law in the United States
 
The Company, via the Oasis LLCs, is classified as having a “direct” involvement in the U.S. marijuana industry and is in compliance with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by the state of Nevada. Neither the Company nor the Oasis LLCs are subject to any citations or notices of violation with applicable licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by each applicable U.S. state which may have an impact on its licenses, business activities or operations.
 
The Company has in place a detailed compliance program overseen and maintained by external state and local regulatory/compliance counsel. The Company’s internal compliance team (consisting of managers for each respective business unit) implements the compliance program.
 
 23


The Company’s internal compliance team oversees training for all employees, including on the following topics:
 

● | compliance with state and local laws
--+-------------------------------------


● | safe cannabis use
--+------------------


● | dispensing procedures
--+----------------------


● | security and safety policies and procedures
--+--------------------------------------------


● | inventory control
--+------------------


● | quality control
--+----------------


● | transportation procedures
--+--------------------------

 
The Company’s compliance program emphasizes security and inventory control to ensure strict monitoring of cannabis and inventory from delivery by a licensed distributor to sale or disposal. Only authorized, properly trained employees are allowed to access the Company’s computerized seed-to-sale system.
 
The Company’s internal compliance team, together with external state and local regulatory/compliance counsel, monitors all compliance notifications from the regulators and inspectors in each market, timely resolving any issues identified. The Company keeps records of all compliance notifications received from the state regulators or inspectors and how and when the issue was resolved.
 
Further, the Company has created comprehensive standard operating procedures that include detailed descriptions and instructions for receiving shipments of inventory, inventory tracking, recordkeeping and record retention practices related to inventory, as well as procedures for performing inventory reconciliation and ensuring the accuracy of inventory tracking and recordkeeping. The Company maintains accurate records of its inventory at all licensed facilities. Adherence to the Company’s standard operating procedures is mandatory and ensures that the Company’s operations are compliant with the rules set forth by the applicable state and local laws, regulations, ordinances, licenses and other requirements. The Company ensures adherence to standard operating procedures by regularly conducting internal inspections and ensures that any issues identified are resolved quickly and thoroughly. In January 2018, United States Attorney General, Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum and thereby created a vacuum of guidance for enforcement agencies and the Department of Justice.2 As an industry best practice, despite the recent rescission of the Cole Memorandum, the Company continues to do the following to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum:
 

● | Ensure the operations of its subsidiaries are compliant with all licensing requirements that are set forth with regards to cannabis operation by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough, and other political/administrative divisions. To this end, the Company retains appropriately experienced legal counsel to conduct the necessary due diligence to ensure compliance of such operations with all applicable regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Company only works through licensed operators, which must pass a range of requirements, adhere to strict business practice standards and be subjected to strict regulatory oversight whereby sufficient checks and balances ensure that no revenue is distributed to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Company conducts reviews of products and product packaging to ensure that the products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company, together with external state and local regulatory/compliance counsel, will continue to monitor compliance on an ongoing basis in accordance with its compliance program and standard operating procedures. While the Company’s operations are in full compliance with all applicable state laws, regulations and licensing requirements, such activities remain illegal under United States federal law. For the reasons described above and the risks further described in the “Risk Factors” section below, there are significant risks associated with the business of the Company. Readers are strongly encouraged to carefully read all of the risk factors contained in the “Risk Factors” section below.

Although state-licensed businesses engaged in such activities are currently proceeding largely free from federal prosecution and recently-enacted federal spending legislation prohibits the Department of Justice from using federal funds to prevent states from implementing their own marijuana laws, changes in congress or in the executive administration, including presidential elections, could result in changes to current federal enforcement policies regarding cannabis-related activities which are legal under certain state laws. Therefore, by operating the business, we will face the possibility of civil and criminal sanctions.
 
Additionally, certain states in which we seek to operate may prohibit non-resident companies from conducting business directly in the state. In such states, we will seek to enter into a collaborative arrangement with a local entity holding the necessary licensure, whereby we will agree to lease our facilities, equipment and employees to the licensed entity in exchange for a fee. Such an arrangement may be difficult to secure and/or expensive to maintain, as we will be reliant on the licensee to maintain its license in order to continue operations.  Further, various state and local licensure application and approval processes may require significant time and expense, and, upon becoming authorized to do business in a state, it may be difficult or expensive for us to comply with the oft-changing laws, regulations and licensure requirements of each state and municipality where we are doing business.
 
We will need to obtain applicable state licenses in each state in which we will operate processing facilities.  License requirements and procedures vary from state to state.  The initial state in which we plan to operate is Colorado.  Subsequently, we will likely seek to operate in Nevada and Washington.
