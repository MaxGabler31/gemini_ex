ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Overview



BoxScore Brands, Inc. (formerly U-Vend Inc.) (the “Company”) is a US based renewable energy company focused on the extraction, refinement and distribution of technical minerals.



The Company formerly developed, marketed and distributed various self-serve electronic kiosks and mall/airport co-branded islands throughout North America. Due to the nationwide shutdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company spent a portion of 2020 restructuring and retiring certain corporate debt and obligations. The Company focused on implementing a new operational direction.



Through the corporate reorganization and repositioning process, the Company found itself with the unique opportunity to expand its management team and acquire mining claims that historically reported high levels of Lithium and other tech minerals. The Company hired and affiliated itself with industry veterans that bring decades of experience, credibility and relationships.



On November 5, 2021, the Company acquired the rights to 102 Federal Mining Claims located in the Lisbon Valley of Utah. The acquisition was driven by historical mineral data from seven (7) existing wells with brine aquifer access. The independent third-party Technical Report indicated that further investment and development in the claims were warranted.



The Company has been executing the necessary steps to prove the tech reports findings and has retained RESPEC Company LLC as its Geotech, Engineering and Resource Management partner to assist in the exploration of the Lisbon Valley brine extraction project. Leveraging their expertise, the company will focus on several initiatives, that include:




● | Advancement of geotech, engineering, geology and fieldwork to complete Technical Reports on the Lisbon Project.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Understanding Lisbon Valley brines, on and around owned leases.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Develop a well plan to re-enter, sample, and test the “Superior Well”, that has a historical lithium concentration of 730 ppm (parts per million).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enter other prospective plugged and abandoned wells, taking brine samples and performing hydrological testing at each identified high potential zone to evaluate the properties of the clastic formation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | As information is advanced, prepare technical reports following the NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, initially a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) and longer term, a Preliminary Feasibility Study (PFS).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Test the collected brines for lithium, but also for previously identified high value elements such as cobalt, manganese, magnesium, and suites of metals in the alkaline earth metals, transition metals, and halogens group.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Based on the results of the Superior well, develop area resource estimates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------




The Company has been moving forward with its strategy of employing advanced brine extractive technology methodologies and has been in talks with numerous extraction providers. Selective mineral extraction is clearly the most cost-effective and ESG friendly approach currently available. Technologies are being utilized that can extract the desired minerals and metals from the brine and then re-inject the brines back down into the aquafer. The prospective partners have been provided the analytical results from the technical reports, but will soon provide current results, analytical, Geotech modeling, aquifer modeling, recharge, flows, and depth.



The Lisbon Valley of Utah also provides many added benefits:




● | Historically rich industrial and natural resource extraction area.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A developed infrastructure including high voltage electrical, proximity to major roadways and rail spurs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | State and local agency support through the Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining and the Trust Land Administration (SITLA)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The Company will also look to expand its holdings in the Lisbon Valley area with the acquisition of additional mineral claims and joint venture opportunities.
