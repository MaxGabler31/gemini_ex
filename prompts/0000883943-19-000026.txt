ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Christopher & Banks Corporation is a national specialty retailer featuring exclusively-designed, privately-branded women’s apparel and accessories. We offer our customers an assortment of classic and versatile clothing for her everyday needs at a good value. Our merchandise is developed for women of all sizes, typically age 50 and older with an income level from moderate to above average.

We operate an integrated, omni-channel business platform that is designed to provide customers a seamless retail experience with the ability to shop when and where they want, including our retail stores, outlet stores, and website. This allows our customers to browse, purchase, return, or exchange our merchandise through the channel that is optimal for her.

Unless otherwise noted, the use of the terms “the Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report") refers to Christopher & Banks Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Christopher & Banks, Inc. and Christopher & Banks Company.

Our Brand

Christopher & Banks Corporation was incorporated in 1986 to acquire Braun’s Fashions, Inc., which had operated as a family-owned business since 1956. We became a publicly traded corporation in 1992 and, in July 2000, our stockholders approved a company name change from Braun’s Fashions Corporation to Christopher & Banks Corporation. Christopher & Banks caters to missy and petite sized customers. In 2000, we introduced our women’s plus sized collection under the name C.J. Banks.

We offer merchandise assortments that reflect a balance of novelty and basic core items, at affordable prices. We emphasize comfort and easy care in relevant fashions with a consistent fit. To differentiate ourselves from our competitors, our buyers, working in conjunction with our product development teams and suppliers, strive to create a merchandise assortment of coordinated outfits, the majority of which are manufactured exclusively for us under our proprietary Christopher & Banks® and C.J. Banks® names.

Our Store Formats

Our Christopher and Banks (“CB”) stores offer merchandise assortments in women’s apparel and accessories for missy sizes 4 to 16 and petite sizes 4P to 16P.

Our C.J. Banks (“CJ”) stores offer merchandise assortments in similar women’s apparel and accessories for women’s sizes 14W to 26W.

Our Missy, Petite, Women (“MPW”) and outlet stores, and our website offer merchandise assortments from both Christopher and Banks and C.J. Banks in all three size ranges resulting in greater opportunity to service our customers and improve our sales productivity.

Our Strategy

Our overall business strategy is to significantly improve our operating results and thereby begin the path towards sustainable, long-term revenue growth and consistent profitability through the following strategic initiatives:

• | Enhance the customer shopping experience;


• | Improve marketing and promotional effectiveness;


• | Leverage omni-channel capabilities;


• | Build loyalty and grow our file;


• | Optimize our real estate portfolio; and


• | Right-size our cost structure.

Enhance the Customer Shopping Experience
We are committed to enhancing our customer's shopping experience by providing a well curated product assortment that is presented in a way that is easier for her to shop. We are focused on improving the flow and depth of our inventory buys which are intended to help her build an outfit and drive units per transaction. Additionally, we have recently launched a new Style and Selling model to support our store associates in providing even better service and, more importantly, driving sales.
Improve Marketing and Promotional Effectiveness
Our goals include executing disciplined markdown management, leveraging improved analytics to inform what types and depth of promotions and targeted offers are used and to increase our return on our marketing investments.
Leverage Omni-Channel Capabilities
Our integrated, omni-channel strategy is designed to provide customers with a seamless retail experience, allowing her to shop whenever, however and wherever she chooses. In January of 2018, we launched “Buy online ship to store,” and in November of 2018, we launched “Buy online ship from store.” We currently are fulfilling eCommerce orders from 170 of our stores. We plan on launching “Buy online pick up in store” during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. These flexible fulfillment options not only serve a customer need, they allow us to better leverage our inventory across our chain. 
Build Loyalty and Grow our Customer File
We have a very loyal customer base that is highly engaged. Our uniquely designed product, our value positioning and our customer service are key differentiators for us and contribute to the loyalty of our customers with approximately 90% of our active customers participating in our loyalty rewards program.
We continue to focus on maximizing the benefits of our customer relationship management (“CRM”) database, Friendship Rewards Loyalty Program (“Friendship Rewards”), and private-label credit card program to strengthen engagement with our customers. Our Friendship Rewards program, in conjunction with our CRM system, allows us to personalize communications and customize our offers. We continue to leverage our direct and digital marketing channels to encourage additional customer visits and increased spending per visit.
To grow our existing customer file, we intend to reallocate our marketing spend in an effort to drive acquisition of new customers, reactivate lapsed customers, and also capitalize on market disruptions. In addition, we intend to refresh our Friendship Rewards program and to continue to leverage that program. Finally, we plan to capitalize on our unique positioning in the market to drive engagement with customers on a grass roots level.
Optimize our Real Estate Portfolio
Between 2011 and 2015 we consolidated our store formats and reduced our store count by 33% in an effort to improve store productivity. Additionally, approximately 44% of our stores have a lease action arising within 12 months and 57% within 24 months. This should provide us with flexibility to close underperforming stores and the opportunity to renegotiate occupancy costs where applicable.

Right-size our Cost Structure
We intend to take a holistic approach in driving cost reductions. To help us in accomplishing this we have hired a third-party, non-merchandise procurement specialist to assist us in analyzing relationships and negotiating cost reductions. In addition, we intend to continue to aggressively negotiate rent reductions, optimize our marketing spend, review and reduce our corporate overhead and reduce our shipping and fulfillment expense.
Our Merchandise

Our merchandise assortments include mostly exclusive designs of women’s apparel, generally consisting of casual clothing, everyday basics, wear-to-work, leisure / active wear, and seasonal sleepwear in missy, petite and women sizes. The Company also offers a selection of jewelry and accessories to complement our customer’s wardrobe.

While each store offers a base merchandise assortment, store assortments vary to reflect individual store demands, sales levels, and local market preferences. We design our products and merchandise them in our stores and through our website in a coordinated manner intended to drive the number of units per transaction. On average, our customers purchase 2 to 3 items per transaction.

Our Operations

All of the Company operations are located in the United States ("U.S."). Merchandise selection, pricing and promotions, procurement and sourcing, marketing and advertising, and labor deployment across all channels are centrally managed at our corporate headquarters. In addition, functional support capabilities (e.g. human resources, finance, legal) are also performed at our corporate location. We also have field operations that support our retail teams. Our retail stores have procedures for transaction processing, customer experience, merchandise display, inventory management, asset protection, and staff training.
Our Stores

As of February 2, 2019, we operated 455 stores in 45 states. The following table illustrates the change in store count and store format for the past five fiscal years:

Store Count Rollforward | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | 
Stores as beginning of year | 463 | | 484 | | 518 | | 518 | | 560 | 
Opened | 10 | | 1 | | 9 | | 42 | | 23 | 
Closed | (14 | ) | (16 | ) | (27 | ) | (19 | ) | (21 | )
Conversions | (4 | ) | (6 | ) | (16 | ) | (23 | ) | (44 | )
Stores at end of year | 455 | | 463 | | 484 | | 518 | | 518 | 


Stores by Format | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014
MPW | 312 | 314 | 318 | 314 | 216 
Outlet | 80 | 78 | 82 | 77 | 44 
Christopher and Banks | 33 | 37 | 43 | 67 | 173 
C.J. Banks | 30 | 34 | 41 | 60 | 85 
Total Stores | 455 | 463 | 484 | 518 | 518 

We continue to evaluate converting the remaining CB stores and CJ stores to MPW stores. MPW stores provide a unified store format that simplifies merchandising and allocation processes, promotes cross shopping among sizes, enhances the customer experience, and enables more economies of scale across functions.

Our Website

Our website at www.christopherandbanks.com provides customers the ability to browse our offerings, locate our stores, and order merchandise online. Our website is designed to be an extension of our brand and is key to our developing omni-channel strategy. The online merchandise assortment consists of a combination of exclusive styles as well as special sizes and lengths. We offer online customers the option to return items in our stores.

Competition

The women’s retail apparel business is highly competitive and includes regional, national and international department stores, specialty stores, boutique stores, catalog companies, off-price and online retailers. Many of these competitors have greater name recognition and some of these competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources compared to us. We compete in the specialty retail space by offering unique, classic and versatile clothing that fits her everyday needs at a good value. We believe our visual merchandise presentation, attentive customer service and physical store locations complement our compelling value proposition.
Global Sourcing and Products

We utilize a broad base of manufacturers located primarily in China, Indonesia and Vietnam with some domestic manufacturing. We believe we produce goods at the level of quality that our customers desire, at a competitive cost. For the most recently completed fiscal year, our ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately 67% of the merchandise we purchased, and our two largest suppliers accounted for 16% and 10% of our goods, respectively.

We purchase our merchandise using individual purchase orders and, therefore, are not subject to long-term production contracts with any of our vendors, manufacturers, or buying agents. We intend to continue our efforts to optimize our purchasing power with consideration for the potential risk of limiting our manufacturing flexibility.

We may take ownership of product either in the foreign country where the factory is located, at a designated point of entry into the United States, or at our distribution center depending on the specific terms of the sale. Most of our sourcing activities are performed by a single-shared sourcing and procurement function. We believe that this function, working in concert with our key supply chain partners, will deliver high quality apparel and accessories at a lower cost while providing the opportunity to minimize freight costs through consolidation. We believe that the decision to centralize our sourcing and procurement operations has helped us mitigate the impact of higher sourcing costs.

Typical lead times for delivery of our merchandise are 90 to 150 days from the date of order placement, however we have some ability to expedite the sourcing of merchandise in those cases where we see an opportunity to garner incremental sales on those items that have resonated with our customer. In addition, we will make purchases domestically when demand warrants.

Although we expect the cost of cotton and synthetics to remain relatively stable in fiscal 2019, our average unit cost may change based on other factors, including overall mix of fashion versus core merchandise, fluctuations in transportation costs and potential changes in tariffs. To the extent that we cannot offset increases in the cost of goods with other cost reductions or efficiencies, we may be forced to sell the product at higher prices, which is subject to customer receptivity.

Merchandise Distribution

We distribute most of our products that are sold in our stores and online from our distribution center located in Plymouth, Minnesota. New merchandise is generally received each weekday at our corporate distribution center. After arrival, merchandise is sorted and packaged for shipment to individual stores or to our third party eCommerce fulfillment center or is held for future store or eCommerce replenishment. Merchandise is generally pre-ticketed with price and related informational tags at the point of manufacture.
Merchandise is typically shipped to our stores via third-party delivery services multiple times per week, providing our stores with a steady flow of new inventory.

Merchandise sold through our eCommerce channel is fulfilled directly to the customer through either our third-party service provider or from one of our stores. In fiscal year 2019, we intend to launch the ability for a customer to buy online and to pick up merchandise in the store.

Information Technology

Our information technology strategy is intended to provide a platform for an integrated, omni-channel retail experience. Our information systems are designed to enable us to obtain, analyze, and take action on information in a timely fashion. We are committed to leveraging technology to maintain effective financial and operational controls.

5

We continue to make investments in capabilities that will allow us to better manage the flow of product. Existing and anticipated system enhancements are intended to allow our teams to analyze store-level data to tailor the merchandise assortment to the demographics of the surrounding community. We expect these insights will lead to improved merchandise assortments thereby generating higher unit velocity and improved average unit retail, which should translate into higher merchandise margins.

We are committed to evolving change management and portfolio management processes and standards to improve the security of our data and our customers’ information as well as to maintain effective financial and operational controls. We have established an information security infrastructure and methodology which can adapt to the evolving needs of the business in an effort to ensure the appropriate safeguarding of assets and secure, reliable customer transactions.
In fiscal 2018 and 2017, we leveraged omni-channel capability investments to further enable us to address multiple customer touch points to drive spend and build brand affinity.

Employees

As of February 2, 2019, we employed approximately 3,700 associates, approximately 32% of whom were full-time employees and the balance of whom were part-time employees. The number of part-time employees fluctuates during peak selling periods. Approximately 190 of our associates are employed at our corporate office and distribution center facility, with the majority of the associate population employed in our store field organization. We have no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees, have never experienced a work stoppage and are unaware of any efforts or plans to organize our employees. We consider relations with our employees to be good. 
Trademarks and Service Marks

We are the owner of certain registered and common law trademarks and service marks (collectively referred to as “Marks”).

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Christopher & Banks Company, is the owner of the federally registered Marks “christopher & banks®,” which is our predominant private brand, and “cj banks®,” our private brand for women sizes 14W to 26W.

Our rights in the Marks are important to our business and are recognized in the women’s retail apparel industry. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our Marks and the related registrations and applications. United States trademark registrations are for a term of ten years and are renewable every ten years as long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade. We are not aware of any claims of infringement or other challenges to our rights to use any registered Marks in the United States.

Seasonality

Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly depending on a number of factors, including general economic conditions, consumer confidence, customer response to our seasonal merchandise mix, timing of new store openings, adverse weather conditions, and shifts in the timing of certain holidays and promotional events. 
Working Capital

We fund our business operations through a combination of cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs, for general corporate purposes and investment opportunities.

Effective inventory management is critical to our success. We employ various methods to manage inventory levels including demand forecasting, optimal allocations, and various forms of inventory replenishment. We seek to minimize markdowns through effective inventory management.
