ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History
SunPower has been a leader in the solar industry for over 30 years, originally incorporated in California in 1985 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2004 in connection with our initial public offering. In November 2011, our stockholders approved the reclassification of all outstanding former class A common stock and class B common stock into a single class of common stock listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol “SPWR.” In fiscal 2011, we became a majority-owned subsidiary of TotalEnergies Solar INTL SAS (“Total,” formerly Total Solar International SAS) and TotalEnergies Gaz & Electricité Holdings SAS (“Total Gaz,” formerly Total Gaz Electricité Holdings France SAS), each a subsidiary of TotalEnergies SE (“TotalEnergies SE,” formerly Total SE).
Company Overview
SunPower Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “SunPower,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a leading solar technology and energy services provider that offers fully integrated solar, storage, and home energy solutions to customers primarily in the United States and Canada through an array of hardware, software, and financing options and “Smart Energy” solutions. Our Smart Energy initiative is designed to add layers of intelligent control to homes, buildings, and grids—all personalized through easy-to-use customer interfaces. We are a leader in the U.S. Distributed Generation (“DG”) storage and energy services market, providing customer control over electricity consumption and resiliency during power outages while providing cost savings to homeowners, businesses, governments, schools, and utilities through multiple offerings. Our sales channels include a strong network of both installing and non-installing dealers and resellers that operate in both residential and commercial markets as well as a group of talented and driven in-house sales teams within each segment engaged in direct sales to end customers. We are invested in growing our business, by focusing on continued innovation, product development, and investments, while enhancing our customer experience and culture. 
On August 26, 2020, we completed the spin-off (the “Spin-Off”) of Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd. (“Maxeon Solar”), a Singapore public company limited by shares, consisting of certain non-U.S. operations and assets of our former SunPower Technologies business unit. As a result of the Spin-Off, we no longer consolidate Maxeon Solar within our financial results of continuing operations. For all periods prior to the Spin-Off, the financial results of Maxeon Solar are presented as net earnings from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations.
Recent Developments
SunPower Manufacturing Oregon, LLC Restructuring
During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we adopted a restructuring plan to realign and optimize workforce requirements concurrent with the planned closure of our manufacturing facility in Hillsboro, Oregon. In connection with the restructuring plan, which included actions implemented in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, a majority of our approximately 170 primarily manufacturing employees exited the business. As of January 2, 2022, we had incurred cumulative costs of approximately $3.6 million in restructuring charges, primarily relating to the payment of severance benefits.
Repayment of Loan Agreement with California Enterprise Development Authority (“CEDA”)
In April 2021, we repaid the outstanding principal amount of our $30.0 million loan with CEDA.
Repayment of 0.875% Debentures Due 2021
In June 2021, we repaid the remaining $62.5 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.875% debentures due 2021.
Acquisition of Blue Raven Solar Holdings, LLC (“Blue Raven”)
On October 4, 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”) to acquire all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Blue Raven, and 35% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Albatross Software LLC (“Albatross”), an affiliate of Blue Raven. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to pay to the sellers up to $145 million in initial cash consideration, which amount is subject to a customary working capital adjustment. The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Company will make certain cash payments to Blue Raven executives, employees and service providers, which are included in the aggregate purchase price, in accordance with related agreements entered into between such individuals and Blue Raven.
The Company has also agreed to make an additional cash payment of up to $20 million (the “Contingent Payment”) based on Blue Raven’s revenue for the period beginning on September 13, 2021 and ending June 19, 2022. The Contingent Payment will increase linearly from $0 up to a maximum of $20 million upon Blue Raven’s achievement of a minimum of 75% of the aggregate revenue amounts agreed to among the parties.
SunPower FinancialTM
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we launched an in-house finance company, SunPower FinancialTM, which offers a complete range of financing products and an increased set of financing options for our customers. SunPower Financial was designed to make renewable energy affordable for more homeowners and increase access to underserved populations by supporting a new line of financial products featuring expanded eligibility. The launch of SunPower Financial supports our commitment to increase access to solar energy for residential customers who live in historically underserved communities by 25% by 2025, in accordance with our SunPower 25x25 initiative launched in September 2021.
Planned Sale of the C&I Solutions Business
On February 6, 2022, we signed an Equity Purchase Agreement (the “definitive agreement”) with TotalEnergies Renewables USA, LLC (“TotalEnergies Renewables”), a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of TotalEnergies SE, for the sale of our Commercial and Industrial Solutions (“C&I Solutions”) business as part of our focus on and investment in our Residential, Light Commercial (“RLC”) business. Subject to the terms and considerations set forth in the definitive agreement, TotalEnergies Renewables will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock of our C&I Solutions business for aggregate cash consideration of $190.0 million, which is subject to certain adjustments, including cash, indebtedness, working capital surplus/shortfall, and transaction expenses. We will receive additional consideration of up to $60.0 million in cash if certain legislative action is taken between February 6 and June 30, 2022.
The sale is subject to customary closing conditions, including internal restructuring of certain legal entities before they are ready for sale, and is currently expected to close before the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022. 
Segments Overview
Our RLC segment refers to sales of fully integrated solar, storage and home energy solutions and components, through a combination of our third-party installing and non-installing dealer network and resellers and our in-house sales team, and includes the results of operations of Blue Raven upon the completion of its acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The C&I Solutions segment refers to direct sales of turn-key engineering, procurement, and construction (“EPC”) services and sales of energy under power purchase agreements (“PPAs”). Certain legacy businesses consisting of worldwide power plant project development and project sales that we are winding down, as well as U.S. manufacturing, are not significant to overall operations, and are deemed non-core to our other businesses and classified as “Others.” Certain key cross-functional support functions and responsibilities including corporate strategy, treasury, tax and accounting support and services, among others, continue to be centrally managed within the Corporate function. 
Our chief executive officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), reviews our business, manages resource allocations and measures performance of our activities between the RLC, C&I Solutions, and Other segments. The CODM further views the business performance of each segment under two key sources of revenues – Dev Co and Power Co. Dev Co refers to our solar origination and installation revenue stream within each segment such as sale of solar power systems with our dealers and resellers network as well as installation and EPC revenue, while Power Co refers to our post-system sale recurring services revenue, mainly from asset management services and operations and maintenance (“O&M”) services through our SunStrong partnership dealer services for RLC and our commercial dealer network for C&I Solutions. The risk profile of each revenue stream is different, and therefore the segregation of Dev Co and Power Co provides the CODM with appropriate information to review business performance and allocate resources to each segment.
Our COVID-19 Response
We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, including its resurgence in key markets as new variants of the virus continue to emerge. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our organization continues to largely operate virtually across the globe, which entails the need for us to continue to support remote workforces at greater scale than we have before COVID-19.
We will continue promoting the health and safety of our employees and contractors. In an effort to protect our employees and contractors, we continue to comply with all health and safety regulations, including adopting social distancing policies at all our locations, working from home, and complying with domestic and international travel restrictions as necessary. As COVID-19 conditions improved in 2021, we began to prepare for more individuals to return to the office; however, with the evolving situation as new variants emerge and our priority on the health and safety of our employees we are continuing our flexible workplace practices until we determine it is safe for our employees to return to the office. We will continue to implement appropriate safety measures, including requiring employees to be fully vaccinated to access our workplace facilities pursuant to federal, state, and local guidelines, as well as taking into consideration COVID-19 case trends and related measures in our locations. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be dynamic, near-term challenges across the economy remain. The ongoing effects of COVID-19 remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity, duration, and resurgences of outbreaks, new variants, the effectiveness of health and safety measures including vaccines, vaccine uptake, the pace and strength of the economic recovery, and supply chain pressures, among others. We will continue to actively monitor the effects of the pandemic and will continue to take appropriate steps to mitigate the impacts to our employees and on our business.
Outlook 
We believe the execution of our strategy will provide attractive opportunities for profitable growth over the long term. With the recent acquisition of Blue Raven, we have expanded our geographic footprint, particularly outside of California, in the U.S. residential solar space, to address the growing demand for residential solar across the country, including the under-penetrated areas in Northwest and Atlantic regions. Further, on February 6, 2022, we signed a definitive agreement with TotalEnergies for the sale of our C&I Solutions business, as part of our growing focus on and investment in our residential solar business. We strongly believe that the time is now for homeowners to adopt solar energy and storage, with flexible financing options and favorable clean energy incentives currently under consideration by Congress that make it easier for consumers to help fight against the increasing impact of climate change. We believe the most significant elements of uncertainty in executing on our strategy are the impact of ongoing global supply chain constraints and the COVID-19 pandemic on component and services costs and consumer spending, as well as the ability of our sales channels, supply chain, and distribution centers to operate with minimal disruption in the near term. In addition, new regulations in California, including the proposed changes to California’s net energy metering (“NEM”) and solar incentive programs (“NEM 3.0”), could lower the net benefit solar customers receive from adopting solar energy, if the proposal is approved. The disruptions noted above could harm California’s solar market and provide uncertainty and negatively impact our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and outlook.
Solutions 
Our RLC segment offers its solutions to residential, light commercial, and new homes markets, and our all-in-one solutions include a full suite of solar power systems: storage, software, and services. As part of our solutions-based approach, we focus on our SunPower Equinox product for our residential business customers and SunPower Helix products for our commercial business customers. The Equinox and Helix systems are pre-engineered modular solutions for residential and light commercial applications, respectively, that combine our high-efficiency solar module technology with integrated plug-and-play power stations, cable management systems, and mounting hardware that enable our customers to quickly and easily complete system installations and manage their energy production. Our Equinox systems utilize our latest A-Series cell and alternating-current photovoltaic technology for residential applications, where we are also working to expand our initiatives on storage and Smart Energy solutions. Our Helix products are available for carport, ground, and roof installations and provide seamless solar solutions at low cost. Additionally, we continue to focus on installing our lower cost, high-efficiency Performance Line and our A-Series product line, which we believe will enhance our ability to rapidly expand our global footprint with minimal capital cost. 
We continue to see a significant and increasing number of opportunities in technologies and capabilities adjacent to our core product offerings that can significantly reduce our customers’ CCOE and expand the lifetime value of a customer, including the integration of energy storage and energy management functionality into our systems, and have made investments to realize those opportunities, enabling our customers to make intelligent energy choices by addressing how they buy and use energy. We have added advanced module-level control electronics to our portfolio of technology designed to enable longer series strings and significant balance of system components cost reductions in large arrays. We offer solar panels that use micro-inverters designed to eliminate the need to mount or assemble additional components on the roof or the side of a building and enable optimization and monitoring at the solar panel level to ensure maximum energy production by the solar system. In addition, our acquisition of Blue Raven has expanded our offerings and increased our opportunities to deliver solar power generation solutions to our customers, with an expanded footprint into new territories of the United States as well. 
OneRoof®
Our latest roofing system, OneRoof®, is a Class A fire-rated, UL-certified roofing system that replaces concrete roofing tiles for a fully integrated roof-plus-solar solution. With flexible design configurations, integrated panel clips, and built-in grounding, installation is simple and designed specifically for new homes. With direct-to-deck attachments, self-aligning modules, and snap-in-place module attachments, OneRoof installs two to three times faster than conventional mounting, and is cost efficient by replacing roof materials. Kynar-coated metal components add a rugged layer of roof protection that lasts longer than typical composite shingles and are covered by our Complete Confidence Warranty. Our Complete Confidence Warranty covers products, parts, and service for 25 years, monitoring hardware for 10 years, and the Kynar-coated-steel finish for 5 years. OneRoof sits seamlessly with the rest of the roof for a sleek, low-profile look with virtually no visible parts. Interlocking flashings and pans with individually sealed screws create a watertight barrier against harsh conditions— including wind-driven rain, and is built to last. OneRoof is the only roof-integrated solar system, paired with the world’s best solar.
SunVault™ Storage 
Our SunVault™ storage solution is primarily designed for residential customers and its two-box solution fits in indoor or outdoor areas. Homeowners get seamless backup power during an outage and the system provides the flexibility to manage energy as they deem fit. SunVault storage integrates with SunPower solar systems, creating the only home solar plus storage solution designed, installed, and warranted by one company. Its intelligent software shifts when drawing power from the grid, maximizing the use of solar, as well as provides real-time updates as to home energy use, solar and storage usage, through customized settings. With only 0.1% of homes in the United States having storage, and power outages continuing to rise, our storage solutions provide an attractive way to use solar. We expect to release an update to our SunVault solution nationwide within the next fiscal year. The updated solution will extend the offering to new segments of the market that are currently not serviced, which will significantly enhance our total serviceable market.
In addition, in the fourth quarter fiscal 2021, we launched our Virtual Power Plant (“VPP”) which will enable SunVault energy storage customers to get paid for allowing the utility to use stored energy during peak demand and contribute to a more stable power grid in their community. VPPs will enable utilities to extract energy from efficient, renewable energy resources like distributed solar and energy storage and disperse it among all grid-connected customers to create a more stable and sustainable source of power. The coordination of the charge and discharge of a participating customer’s battery and sharing of the energy to the utility, while reserving some electricity in the battery for backup power to the home when needed, is performed by SunPower on the customer’s behalf. Customers participating in the VPP, including our first planned VPP offering, ConnectedSolutions, will be notified prior to discharging of the battery and can set their battery threshold levels through customized settings, and in turn are compensated by the utility for their participation.
Flexible Financing Options 
We have a long track record of attracting low-cost capital from diverse sources, including tax equity and debt investors. Since inception, we have raised tax equity investment funds to finance the installation of solar energy systems. 
Advances in financing are playing a big part in driving increased profits and dealer loyalty. We sell our residential solar energy solutions to end customers through a variety of means, including cash and financed systems sales directly to end customers and sales to resellers, including our third-party dealer network. 
We offer financing programs that are designed to provide customers with a variety of options to obtain high-efficiency solar products and systems, including loans arranged through our third-party lending partners, in some cases for no money down, or leases at competitive energy rates. With the launch of SunPower Financial in fiscal 2021, our customers now have a broader choice for both purchasing as well as affordable financing of solar power systems from us. Further, since its launch in 2011, our residential lease program, in partnership with third-party investors, provides U.S. customers SunPower systems under typically 20-year lease agreements that include system maintenance and warranty coverage, including warranties on system performance. SunPower residential lease customers have the option to purchase their leased solar systems upon the sale or transfer of their home. These financing options enhance our ability to provide individually tailored solar solutions to a broad range of residential customers and expand our lifetime value for a customer. 
Commercial Roof, Carport, and Ground Mounted Systems
As part of our complete solution product approach, our C&I Solutions segment offers Helix commercial market products. The Helix system is a pre-engineered, modular solution that combines our industry-leading solar module technology with integrated plug-and-play power stations, cable management systems, and mounting hardware that is built to last and fast to install, enabling customers to scale their solar programs quickly with minimal business disruption. The Helix platform is standardized across rooftop, carport, and ground installations and designed to lower system cost while improving performance. The Helix platform is also bundled with our Smart Energy software analytics, which provides our customers with information about their energy consumption and production, enabling them to further reduce their energy costs. 
The C&I Solutions segment also offers a variety of commercial solutions designed to address a wide range of site requirements for commercial rooftop, parking lot, and open space applications, including a portfolio of solutions utilizing framed panels and a variety of internally or externally developed mounting methods for flat roof and high tilt roof applications. Our commercial flat rooftop systems are designed to be lightweight and to interlock, enhancing wind resistance and providing for secure, rapid installations. 
We offer parking lot structures designed specifically for SunPower panels, balance of system components, and inverters as well as a capability to design and install innovative solar structures and systems for carport applications. These systems are typically custom design-build projects that use standard templates and design best practices to create a solution tailored to unique site conditions. SunPower’s highest efficiency panels are especially well suited to stand-alone structures, such as those found in parking lot applications, because our systems require less steel and other materials per unit of power or energy produced as compared with our competitors.
Community Solar 
SunPower’s Community Solar program is a way for customers to obtain the benefits of solar without having panels installed on their roofs, enabling people who live in apartments, condominiums, and other residences to go solar. These customers are part of a community of solar energy supporters who obtain their power from large solar projects built within their utility district rather than from panels on their respective rooftops.
SunPower has a large commercial and residential customer base to leverage opportunities to expand our community solar footprint. We believe our community solar market offering provides a significant opportunity for growth by leveraging our existing installation base and software platform.
Supply 
The solar panels used in our residential and light commercial systems and solutions are sourced from Maxeon Solar under the terms of our master supply agreement, dated as of February 14, 2022, which replaces the supply agreement we entered into with Maxeon Solar in connection with the Spin-Off. 
We work with our suppliers and partners to ensure the reliability of our supply chain. We are continuing to diversify our supply base by forging new supplier relationships for single-sourced parts to support supply continuity and new products. We have also contracted with certain suppliers for multi-year supply agreements, under which we have annual minimum purchase obligations. In addition, we have established a new dealer diversity program and begun new partnerships with minority-owned business organizations through our SunPower 25x25 initiative, where we are committed to ensuring industry equity and increasing our supplier diversity. For more information about our purchase commitments and obligations, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations” and “Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Technology
Smart Energy 
We see “Smart Energy” as a way to harness our world’s energy potential by connecting the most powerful and reliable solar systems on the market with an increasingly vast array of actionable data that can help our customers make smarter decisions about their energy use. Our Smart Energy initiative is designed to add layers of intelligent control to homes, buildings, and grids—all personalized through easy-to-use customer interfaces. In order to enhance the portfolio of Smart Energy solutions we offer, we plan to continue to invest in integrated technology solutions to help customers manage and optimize their CCOE measurement. 
We have also negotiated several agreements with residential and commercial energy storage providers to integrate storage technology into our residential and commercial solar solutions. By combining storage with energy management, we lower our customers’ cost of energy through improvements in self-consumption, rate arbitrage, demand management, and grid and market participation. We plan to continue to work to make combined solar and storage solutions broadly commercially available. 
Inverters
Every solar power system needs an inverter to transform the direct current electricity collected from the solar panels into utility-grade AC power that is ready for use. We sell inverters manufactured by third parties, some of which are SunPower-branded for both residential and commercial customers. Subsequent to the sale of our microinverter business in August 2018, we exclusively procure microinverters for the manufacture and distribution of AC modules and discrete Module-Level Power Electronics (“MLPE”) system solutions for the U.S. residential market from Enphase Energy, Inc. (“Enphase”). Panels with these factory-integrated microinverters perform better in shaded applications compared to conventional string inverters and allow for optimization and monitoring at the solar panel level, enabling maximum energy production by the solar system.
We are working with Enphase to develop next generation microinverters for use with our high-efficiency solar panels in order to enhance our portfolio of Smart Energy solutions. 
Warranties
SunPower provides a workmanship warranty of up to 25 years from installation and a 25-year standard warranty for previously SunPower-manufactured microinverters. We also warrant our installed systems for defective materials and workmanship for periods ranging up to 25 years as well as provide a separate system output performance warranty to customers that have subscribed to our post-installation monitoring and maintenance services. We pass through to customers warranties from the original equipment manufacturers of certain system components such as solar panels, monitoring equipment and inverters. For such components, our warranties may exceed the warranty coverage from the original equipment manufacturers. For solar energy systems we do not install directly, we receive workmanship warranties from our solar partners.
Customers
Our scope and scale allow us to deliver solar solutions across all segments, ranging from homeowners and new home builders to the largest commercial and governmental entities. Our customers typically include investors, financial institutions, project developers, electric utilities, independent power producers, commercial and governmental entities, production home builders, residential owners, and small commercial building owners. We leverage a combination of direct sales and a broad partner ecosystem to efficiently reach our customer base.
Our internal sales team, SunPower Direct, including a dedicated new homes division, and our third-party dealer network have deployed thousands of SunPower rooftop solar power systems to residential customers. In addition, we work with a variety of development, construction, and system integration companies to deliver our solar power products and solutions to our customers. Our commercial and electric utility customers in our C&I Solutions segment typically choose to purchase solar electricity under a PPA with an investor or financing company that buys the system from us. End-user customers typically pay the investors and financing companies over an extended period of time based on energy they consume from the solar power systems, rather than paying for the full capital cost of purchasing the solar power systems. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Revenue” for our significant customers. 
Competition
The market for solar electric power technologies is competitive and continually evolving. We continue to face increased competition from inflation-driven price increases and decrease in supply, which could lead to loss of sales or market share. Our solar power products and systems compete with many competitors in the solar power market, including, but not limited to:
•SunRun, Inc., Sunnova Energy International Inc., Tesla, Inc., SolarEdge, Vistra Corp, First Solar, Amicus Solar, CED Greentech, GAF Energy, NRG Energy, Inc., Panasonic Corporation, REC Group, and Standard Solar.
The solar energy market in general competes with other energy providers such as electricity produced from conventional fossil fuels supplied by utilities and other sources of renewable energy, including wind, hydro, biomass, solar thermal, and emerging distributed generation technologies such as micro-turbines, sterling engines and fuel cells. We also face competition from resellers that have developed related offerings that compete with our product and service offerings, or have entered into strategic relationships with other existing solar power system providers. We also compete for limited government funding for research and development contracts, customer tax rebates and other programs that promote the use of solar, and other renewable forms of energy with other renewable energy providers and customers.
We believe that the key competitive factors in the market for solar energy management solutions, including systems, storage, and software, are:
•total system price;
•warranty protection, quality, and customer service;
•LCOE evaluation;
•CCOE evaluation;
•power, efficiency, and performance under realistic operating conditions;
•aesthetic appearance of solar panels and systems;
•wind, snow, and structural load capability;
•speed and ease of installation through modular solutions; 
•dealer and installer training and operational excellence;
•high-productivity sales and commissioning software tools for dealers;
•leveraging extensive fleet data for reliability;
•engagement with end customer community;
•strength of distribution relationships;
•availability of efficient third-party or in-house financing;
•established sales channels to customers;
•bankability, strength, and reputation of our Company;
•solar commercial investment tax credit (“ITC”) and federal regulation;
•third-party loan providers and interest rates; and
•offer complete integrated solutions.
We believe that we can compete favorably with respect to each of these elements, although we may be at a disadvantage in comparison to larger companies with broader product lines, greater technical service and support capabilities, and financial resources. For more information on risks related to our competition, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including “Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—An increase in the global supply of solar cells and panels, and increasing competition, may cause substantial downward pressure on the prices of such products, limiting our ability to sell our differentiated panels at a premium, causing us to lose sales or market share, resulting in lower revenues, earnings, and cash flows. Conversely, supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures may cause the cost of solar cells and panels, and other components, to rise, and our suppliers may seek to pass these costs on to us, which would increase our costs and could result in lower margins and revenues, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, and financial condition.”
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, and contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights. “SunPower” and the “SunPower” logo are our registered trademarks in the United States for use with solar cells, solar panels, energy monitoring systems, inverters, and mounting systems. We also hold registered trademarks for, among others, “SunPower Equinox,” “SunPower Giving,” “SunPower Horizons,” “Bottle the Sun,” “Demand Better Solar,” “EDDiE,” “EnergyLink,” “Equinox,” “Experiential Learning. Expanding Opportunities.,” “Helix,” “InvisiMount,” “Light on Land,” “PowerLight,” “Powering a Brighter Tomorrow,” “SafeChem,” “Smarter Solar,” “Sol,” “SunTile,” “SunVault,” “OneRoof,” “The Future of Energy. Today,” “Blue Raven Solar,” “The Planet’s Most Powerful Solar,” and “The Power of One” in certain countries. We are seeking and will continue to seek registration of the “SunPower” trademark and other trademarks in additional countries as we believe is appropriate. As of January 2, 2022, we held registrations for 35 trademarks in the United States, and had 12 trademark registration applications pending. We also held 20 trademark registrations and had zero trademark applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We typically require our business partners to enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our solar cells, technology, or business plans. We typically enter into proprietary information agreements with employees, consultants, vendors, customers, and joint venture partners.
We own multiple patents and patent applications that cover aspects of the technology in the solar panels, mounting products, energy storage, software, and electrical and electronic systems that we sell. We continue to file for and receive new patent rights on a regular basis. The lifetime of a utility patent typically extends for 20 years from the date of filing with the relevant government authority. We assess appropriate opportunities for patent protection of those aspects of our technology, designs, methodologies, and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages to us, and for licensing opportunities of new technologies relevant to our business. As of January 2, 2022, we held 624 patents in the United States (397 licensed to Maxeon Solar or its affiliates), which will expire at various times through 2041, and had 178 U.S. patent applications pending (123 licensed to Maxeon Solar or its affiliates). We also had 198 patents and had 36 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. While patents are an important element of our intellectual property strategy, our business as a whole is not dependent on any one patent or any single pending patent application. We additionally rely on trade secret rights to protect proprietary information and know-how. We therefore typically require employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements to protect them.
When appropriate, we enforce our intellectual property rights against other parties. For more information about risks related to our intellectual property, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We depend on our intellectual property, and we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend and could result in the loss of significant rights,” “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We rely substantially upon trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights, and, if these rights are not sufficiently protected, our ability to compete and generate revenue could suffer,” and “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—We may not obtain sufficient patent protection on the technology embodied in the solar and other products we currently manufacture and market, which could harm our competitive position and increase our expenses.”
Regulations
Public Policy Considerations
Different public policy mechanisms have been used by governments to accelerate the adoption and use of solar power and energy storage. Examples of customer-focused financial mechanisms include capital cost rebates, performance-based incentives, feed-in tariffs, tax credits, and net energy metering. Some of these government mandates and economic incentives are scheduled to be reduced or to expire, or could be eliminated altogether, while others are scheduled to be extended or expanded. Capital cost rebates provide funds to customers based on the cost and size of a customer’s solar power or energy storage system. Performance-based incentives provide funding to a customer based on the energy produced by their solar power system or stored by their energy storage system. Feed-in tariffs pay customers for solar power system generation based on energy produced, at a rate generally guaranteed for a period of time. Tax credits reduce a customer’s taxes at the time the taxes are due. Net energy metering allows customers to deliver to the electric grid any excess electricity produced by their on-site solar power systems, and to be credited for that excess electricity at or near the full retail price of electricity.
In addition to the mechanisms described above, new market development mechanisms to encourage the use of renewable energy sources continue to emerge. For example, many states in the United States have adopted (and subsequently expanded) renewable portfolio standards which mandate that a certain portion of electricity delivered to customers come from eligible renewable energy resources. Some states additionally mandate that a certain portion of that eligible renewable energy must be distributed generation. Many states have also adopted community solar programs and energy storage mandates. Further, changes in federal and state policies including introduction of new legislation may pose incremental risks or provide opportunities for the Company’s business that may impact our future operations and financial condition. For more information about how we avail ourselves of the benefits of public policies and the risks related to public policies, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including “Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—The reduction, modification, or elimination of government incentives could cause our revenue to decline and harm our financial results,” “Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—Existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products, which may significantly reduce demand for our products and services,” and “Risks Related to Our Sales Channels—Changes in international trade policies, tariffs, or trade disputes could significantly and adversely affect our business, revenues, margins, results of operations, and cash flows.”
Environmental, Social, Governance (“ESG”)
We use, generate, and discharge materials which may be classified as toxic, volatile, or otherwise hazardous chemicals and wastes which have resulted from our research and development and construction activities. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the purchase, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials. We believe that we have all environmental permits necessary to conduct our business and expect to obtain all necessary environmental permits for future activities. We believe that we have properly handled our hazardous materials and wastes and have appropriately remediated any contamination at any of our premises. We are currently not subject to any litigation pertaining to environment regulations and cost of compliance with applicable regulations is expected to be commensurate with our historical spend and other companies in the industry. 
In addition to our existing environmental compliance initiatives, we have engaged additional resources to provide comprehensive oversight and reporting of the ESG components across our processes and business units. Additionally, as part of our commitment to energy sustainability, we published our fiscal 2020 Environmental, Social and Governance Report (“2020 ESG Report”) in May 2021. 
As part of our diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DE&I”) initiative, we also launched SunPower 25X25 in September 2021, through which we committed to make renewable energy more accessible for historically underserved communities. We recognize the importance of a diverse and inclusive work environment, and are committed to increasing workforce diversity, expanding access for customers, including the development of a new program for providing no interest loans to low-income customers, and ensuring industry equity, including the establishment of a new dealer diversity program. We will report our progress with respect to this pledge annually in our ESG report. 
Information concerning certain limited activities related to Iran
All the information concerning the activities of our affiliate TotalEnergies SE and its affiliated companies (collectively, the “TotalEnergies”) related to Iran that took place in 2021 provided in this section is disclosed pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”).
In addition, information for 2021 is provided concerning the payments made by TotalEnergies’ affiliates to, or additional cash flow that operations of TotalEnergies affiliates generate for the government of Iran (identified by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism) or any entity controlled by such government. 
TotalEnergies believes that these activities are not subject to sanctions under applicable international economic sanctions regimes, including those adopted by the United States and the European Union (the “Sanctions Regime”). 
TotalEnergies’ operational activities related to Iran were stopped in 2018 following the withdrawal of the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (“JCPOA”) in May 2018 and prior to the re-imposition of U.S. secondary sanctions on the oil industry as of November 5, 2018.
Statements in this section concerning companies controlled by TotalEnergies SE intending or expecting to continue activities described below are subject to such activities continuing to be permissible under applicable international economic sanctions regimes and are based on information provided to us by Total Energies.
Exploration & Production
The Tehran branch office of Total E&P South Pars S.A.S., a wholly-owned subsidiary of TotalEnergies SE, which opened in 2017 for the purposes of the development and production of phase 11 of the South Pars gas field, ceased all operational activities prior to November 1, 2018. In addition, since November 2018, TotalEnergies EP Iran BV maintains a local representative office in Tehran with four employees solely for non-operational functions.
Concerning payments made to Iranian entities in 2021, TotalEnergies EP Iran BV and Elf Petroleum Iran collectively made payments of approximately IRR 2.02 billion (approximately €39,894, converted using the average exchange rate for fiscal year 2021, as published by the Central Bank of Iran) to the Iranian administration for taxes and social security contributions concerning the staff of this representative office. None of these payments were executed in US dollars.
Since November 30, 2018, TotalEnergies E&P UK Limited (“TEP UK”), a wholly owned subsidiary, holds a 1% interest in a joint-venture relating to the Bruce field in the United Kingdom (the “Bruce Field Joint-Venture”) with Serica Energy (UK) Limited (“Serica”) (98%, operator) and BP Exploration Operating Company Limited (“BPEOC”) (1%), following the completion of the sale of 42.25% of TEP UK’s interest in the Bruce Field Joint-Venture on November 30, 2018 pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement dated August 2, 2018 entered into between TEP UK and Serica.
The Bruce Field Joint-Venture is party to an agreement governing certain transportation, processing and operation services provided to another joint-venture at the Rhum field in the UK (the “Bruce Rhum Agreement”). The licensees of the Rhum field are Serica (50%, operator) and the Iranian Oil Company UK Ltd (“IOC UK”), a subsidiary of NIOC (50%), an Iranian government-owned corporation. Under the terms of the Bruce Rhum Agreement, the Rhum field owners pay a proportion of the operating costs of the Bruce field facilities calculated on a gas throughput basis.
In November 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”) granted a conditional license to BPEOC and Serica authorizing provision of services to the Rhum field following the re-imposition of US secondary sanctions. The principal condition of the license is that the ownership of shares in IOC UK by Naftiran Intertrade Company Limited (the trading branch of the NIOC) are transferred into and held in a Jersey-based trust, thereby ensuring that the Iranian government does not derive any economic benefit from the Rhum field so long as US sanctions against these entities remain in place. IOC UK’s interest is managed by an independent management company established by the trust and referred to as the “Rhum Management Company” (“RMC”). If necessary, TEP UK liaises with RMC in relation to the Bruce Rhum Agreement and TEP UK expects to continue liaising with RMC on the same basis in 2022.
In January 2021, OFAC renewed the conditional license to Serica authorizing the provision of services to the Rhum field, until January 31, 2023, subject to early termination if the trust arrangements described above should terminate. In addition, OFAC confirmed that, to the extent that the license remains valid and Serica represents that the conditions set out in the license are met, activities and transactions of non-US persons involving the Rhum field or the Bruce field, including in relation to the operation of the trust, IOC UK and RMC will not be exposed to US secondary sanctions with respect to Iran.
IOC UK’s share of costs incurred under the Bruce Rhum Agreement has been paid to TEP UK in 2021 by RMC. In 2021, based upon TEP UK’s 1% interest in the Bruce Field Joint Venture and income from the net cash flow sharing arrangement with Serica, gross revenue to TEP UK from IOC UK’s share of the Rhum field resulting from the Bruce Rhum Agreement was approximately £4.93 million. This amount was used to offset operating costs on the Bruce field and as such, generated no net profit to TEP UK. TEP UK expects to continue this activity in 2022.
TEP UK is also party to an agreement with Serica whereby TEP UK uses reasonable endeavors to evacuate Rhum NGL from the St Fergus Terminal (the “Rhum NGL Agreement”). TEP UK provides this service subject to Serica having title to all of the Rhum NGL to be evacuated and Serica having a valid license from OFAC for the activity. The service is provided on a cost basis, and TEP UK charges a monthly handling fee that generates an income of approximately £35,600 per annum relating to IOC UK’s 50% interest in the Rhum field. After costs, TEP UK realizes little profit from this arrangement. TEP UK expects to continue this activity in 2022.
Gas, Renewables & Power 
In 2021, TotalEnergies Electricité et Gaz France, a wholly owned subsidiary, supplied electricity to the Iranian Embassy in Paris (France). This activity generated a gross turnover of approximately €18,400 and a net margin of approximately €1,000 in 2021. TotalEnergies Electricité et Gaz France expects to continue this activity in 2022.
Marketing & Services
In 2021, TotalEnergies Marketing France, a wholly owned subsidiary, provided fuel payment cards to be used in TotalEnerges’ service stations to the Iranian Embassy and the Iranian delegation to UNESCO located in Paris (France). This activity generated a gross turnover of approximately €20,150 (without tax) and a net profit of approximately €1,500 (without tax) in 2021. TotalEnergies Marketing France expects to continue this activity in 2022.
In 2021, TotalEnergies Marketing Belgium, a wholly owned subsidiary, provided fuel payment cards to be used in TotalEnerges’ service stations to the Iranian Embassy located in Brussels (Belgium). This activity generated a gross turnover of approximately €13,000 and a net profit of approximately €1,600 (without tax) in 2021. TotalEnergies Marketing Belgium expects to continue this activity in 2022.
Patents & Trademarks
In 2021, TotalEnergies paid less than €1,000 to Iranian authorities related to abandoned patents; these payments relate to abandonment proceedings and similar payments may be made in 2022. In addition, TotalEnergies made small payments in 2021 to Iranian authorities related to the maintenance and protection of trademarks and designs in Iran and may make similar small payments in 2022. These payments are not prohibited by applicable Sanctions Regimes.
Seasonal Trends and Economic Incentives
Our business is subject to industry-specific seasonal fluctuations including changes in weather patterns and economic incentives, such as changes to the amount and timing of the ITC, among others. Sales have historically reflected these seasonal trends with the largest percentage of total revenues realized during the last two quarters of our fiscal year. The construction of solar power systems or installation of solar power components and related revenue may decline during cold and/or rainy winter months. In the United States, many customers make purchasing decisions towards the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for other budgetary reasons. In addition, revenues may fluctuate due to the timing of project sales, construction schedules, and revenue recognition of certain projects, which may significantly impact our quarterly results of operations.
Human Capital Management
SunPower had a team of about 3,660 full-time employees worldwide as of January 2, 2022. About 2,510 of these employees were located in the United States, and about 1,150 were located in the Philippines. Of these employees, approximately 2,040 were engaged in construction projects, 180 in research and development, 1,070 in sales and marketing, and 370 in general and administrative services. Our employees are not represented by labor unions on an ongoing basis, we have not experienced a work stoppage, and we believe our relations with our employees to be good. 
We have a strong management team, and we believe they have the right experience to effectively implement our growth strategies and lead SunPower for long-lasting success. With the recent acquisition of Blue Raven, we added about 620 full-time employees to our talented workforce and we are driven to build on a sustainable growth environment for our combined company. We also have a group of about 1,080 contractors engaged in various activities worldwide as of January 2, 2022, of which about 760 were added to our workforce with the recent acquisition of Blue Raven.
How SunPower develops, attracts, and retains personnel
With our mission To Change the Way Our World is Powered, we work to attract top talent to join the SunPower team. Given the technical nature of our business, our success depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees through a focus on university recruiting, experienced mid-career talent, and working with technical trade partners. We are dedicated to creating a diverse, inclusive, and safe work environment where each person can deliver their best every day. We believe our work environment fosters a rich, equitable culture that allows us to make an impact on our world. We launched our 25x25 DE&I initiative in September 2021, in which we committed to increase workforce and supplier diversity. 
SunPower employees are responsible for understanding our vision and values, and how their actions support the achievement of our vision on a daily basis. We drive high levels of performance and improvement on a quarterly basis through our long-standing tradition of management by objective, with a clear link back to our core values: Put Safety First, Deliver Superior Experiences, Accountability, Do The Right Thing, Innovate Relentlessly, and Be Fast and Nimble. Our employees generally receive feedback and coaching from their managers on at least a quarterly basis, ensuring ongoing development and providing opportunities to outline career aspirations and development plans. 
Attraction and retention of key employees contributes to our ability to remain competitive, and we have a comprehensive total rewards system to help ensure we are compensating and rewarding our employees in line with market practice, providing a competitive benefits programs, and providing flexibility through programs like our Volunteer Time Off initiative. Our pay for performance philosophy helps align employee interests with those of our stockholders by rewarding achievements that meet or exceed corporate goals, and grants of stock-based awards under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan are intended to align compensation with the price performance of our common stock.
The importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion
SunPower is an equal opportunity employer, and we are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive work environment and creating a strong culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion, strengthened by the launch of our 25x25 initiative in 2021. 
Our differences make us stronger. We are diverse in race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, faith, veteran status, ability, and much more. We celebrate these differences. The way we identify ourselves also extends beyond these foundations to diversity of thought and perspective, a range of approaches to problem-solving, and different life experiences. The value we place on diversity is reflected in the way we treat each other and our communities.
Together we are powerful. The power of inclusion is in valuing everyone and their unique contribution. It is important for all our employees to be respected, welcomed, and feel that they are part of something bigger. A culture of inclusion leads to more innovation, healthier working relationships, better decision-making, more fulfilled employees, a better ability to serve our customers, and ultimately a company that does well by doing good. 
We lead with intention. SunPower values diversity of all kinds, and our people and leadership are encouraged to foster inclusion. Our leaders are expected to lead by example. This starts with building awareness on the part of every SunPower employee and holding ourselves accountable. We are committed to never stop listening, learning, and improving.
More information about SunPower’s diversity, equity, and inclusion programs is available on our website and in our published 2020 ESG report. The content of our website, including without limitation our 2020 ESG Report, is not incorporated by reference into this report. Our new 2021 ESG report is expected to be published in the second fiscal quarter of 2022.
A strong safety culture
We are committed to protecting the environment, providing a safe workplace, and protecting the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers, and other stakeholders. We pursue continual improvement by setting targets and objectives to promote health and safety while aiming to conserve natural resources, minimize waste, and provide an environmentally friendly workplace. We work to ensure that all jobs and processes are planned and performed in a safe, healthy, and environmentally friendly manner. We have also launched a third-party Safety Program Assessment where we have reinstituted Executive Safety Walks, live training, and increase Safety Resources.
The health and safety of our employees and contractors continues to be a top priority even more so as we continue to be faced with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and as new variants continue to emerge. In an effort to protect our employees and contractors, we continue to comply with all health and safety regulations, including adopting social distancing policies at all our locations, working from home, and complying to domestic and international travel restrictions as necessary. As COVID-19 conditions improved in 2021, we began to prepare for more individuals to return to the office; however, with the evolving situation as new variants emerge and our priority on the health and safety of our employees we are continuing our flexible workplace practices until we determine it is safe for our employees to return to the office. We will continue to implement appropriate safety measures, including requiring employees to be fully vaccinated to access our workplace facilities pursuant to federal, state, and local guidelines, as well as taking into consideration COVID-19 case trends and related measures in our locations. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers.
