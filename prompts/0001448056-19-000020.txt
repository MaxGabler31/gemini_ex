Item 1. Business
Overview
New Relic is a strategic platform that companies use to monitor, manage, and operate their digital businesses. We provide software and DevOps teams with the tools they need to move faster, make better decisions, and create best-in-class digital experiences. From the beginning, our ambition has been to instrument more of the digital world than anyone else. We exist to continue that work along the expanse of the Internet, because our goal is to establish the standards by which all software and its impact can be measured and improved.
Digital initiatives have become critical to the success of global businesses across industries. Fundamental technology and business shifts are now enabling continuous improvements to these digital environments. First, organizations around the globe are adopting digital transformation strategies to meet the demands of an increasingly digitally savvy customer base. Second, companies are increasingly adopting cloud technologies, utilizing the cloud as a new foundational architecture to support their digital business. Both of these shifts have put tremendous pressure on internal technology teams to adapt to these new business demands. In response to this pressure, engineering teams are adopting new agile processes and software development operations, or DevOps, practices that enable them to move to the cloud faster and take advantage of modern infrastructure technologies like microservices and containers, in order to accelerate their pace of innovation and responsiveness to business demands.
New Relic is positioned at the center of these trends, which are changing the way companies build and deliver software. The New Relic Platform, our integrated, multi-tenant instrumentation and analytics platform, enables our customers to collect, store, and analyze vast quantities of data flowing through and about their software. Our end users, primarily developers and operations professionals, are generally tasked with creating and deploying software code, with the goal of driving revenue growth, increasing productivity, and enhancing brand value at their companies. Customers using the New Relic Platform are empowered to build and release software into production more quickly, all while maintaining or improving uptime and stability, to improve their competitive position in a global environment where software is a critical differentiator.
Our cloud architecture, software-as-a-service, or SaaS, business model and fully integrated software solution provide visibility into every layer of the modern software stack, from infrastructure to the end user experience, with an application-centric perspective. We believe that the application tier is the most strategic layer for delivering business value in modern software stacks, since the application is closest to the end-user. In addition, our cloud-based platform provides out-of-the-box curated experiences for our customers, enabling them to scale to meet the ever-changing needs of their business.
Our Growth Strategy
We employ a land, expand, and standardize go-to-market strategy, which combines grassroots user adoption with both customized low-touch and high-touch sales approaches. We often land in new accounts to support grassroots projects, and because our products are easy to download and use, users within larger organizations often grow our footprint within their companies, as they increase the number of applications monitored and expand their use of our products. This allows customers to develop into accounts with hundreds of users across multiple roles, each accessing a common set of data through the New Relic Platform to deliver real-time visibility into the operations of their digital business. Over time, we plan to drive efficient growth through the following efforts:
•expanding our installed base by increasing application coverage, cross-selling additional products, and benefiting from growth in organic usage;
•adding new enterprise and mid-market customers;
•further penetrating international markets; and
•expanding the platform with additional paid offerings and platform capabilities.
Our Solution
Software and DevOps teams rely on the breadth and depth of visibility provided by the New Relic Platform to collect, store, and analyze vast quantities of data flowing through and about their software. Our new user interface, New Relic One, is entity-centric and sits above the existing New Relic Platform. For teams with complex environments, New Relic One empowers them to find, visualize, and understand the entities and their dependencies to innovate faster, make better decisions, and create best-in-class digital experiences. Our most notable products within the New Relic Platform include:

•New Relic APM: Application performance monitoring, or APM, provides visibility into the performance and usage of server-based applications, such as data pertaining to response time, transaction throughput, error rates, top transactions, and user satisfaction.
•New Relic Mobile: Mobile application performance monitoring provides code-level visibility into the performance and health of mobile applications running on the iOS and Android mobile operating systems.
•New Relic Browser: Monitors the page view experiences of actual end-users for desktop and mobile browser-based applications and provides code-level diagnostics for JavaScript code running directly in the browser.
•New Relic Synthetics: Tests software through simulated usage to reproduce business-critical functionality that enables our users to test their software throughout the entire development life cycle. Users benefit from enhanced visibility, availability, and reliability of their software without depending on interactions from real users.
•New Relic Infrastructure: Provides a complete view of the health and configuration changes for an enterprise’s entire host ecosystem across all environments, from their own data centers to public cloud services to hybrid cloud deployments. Because New Relic Infrastructure is part of our integrated cloud-based instrumentation platform, every infrastructure component and service can be analyzed with performance and health metrics for the applications they support.
•New Relic Insights: Provides real-time big data analytics for technology and business users to perform real-time analysis in order to make faster, data-driven decisions about their organizations. It is an integrated platform feature included with paid subscriptions of our New Relic APM, New Relic Infrastructure, New Relic Browser, and New Relic Mobile products. Users can query their data in either a curated or ad hoc fashion.
The New Relic Platform uses a common infrastructure to enable customers to:
•Collect. We provide customers with our software code, called agents, to add to their applications and infrastructure. These agents enable developers and operations teams to easily deploy software code into their applications and related IT infrastructure, including physical and virtual servers, browsers, and mobile devices. We also provide a number of open data application performance interfaces, or APIs, and software development kits, or SDKs, for customers, partners, and third-party developers to extend our platform into their products, increasing their ability to capture more types of data within the New Relic Platform.
•Store. Data collected by our customers is stored in our highly secure and scalable cloud-based, big data database. Our database has been crafted so that our customers do not need to build or maintain their own big data solution for digital operations. We have optimized this database to store data as well as handle the analytics and queries that we believe are important to drive decision making.
•Analyze. We offer New Relic chart builder and dashboards to allow our customers to use connected data to build flexible, information-dense visuals easily. Data queries are accessible to team members with a range of experience through basic and advanced chart builder modes. This functionality makes it easier for customers to create flexible visuals that are tailored to their business from anywhere within the New Relic Platform, enabling them to get answers to their questions quickly without having to re-index or re-instrument their data.
The New Relic Platform also contains the following platform capabilities:
•New Relic Applied Intelligence includes features such as NRQL Baseline Alerting and New Relic APM Error Profiles, which work together to enable engineering and operations teams to intelligently spot abnormal behavior across billions of pieces of data, predict where problems may arise, and ultimately provide prescriptive recommendations for problems before they impact customers.
•New Relic Alerts provides a centralized notification system that delivers alerts from across the products that make up the New Relic Platform. It allows users to manage alert policies and alert conditions in order to receive early notification to identify potential performance issues and take action.
•New Relic’s extensible architecture provides customers, partners, and third-party developers with APIs and SDKs to build software integrations that extend our functionality and data into other application or IT environments. For example, while our focus is on supporting modern programming languages and frameworks with our agents, some customers and developers have built integrations to address custom or legacy on-premise applications and architectures. In addition, these integrations can also extend the functionality and data from other applications and sources into our databases.
Key Elements of Our Solution
•SaaS-Based Delivery Model. We designed our products based on cloud architecture and a SaaS delivery model. We are able to provide frequent updates to our software, enabling us to continuously improve it to reflect technology developments.

This approach delivers a wide range of technology and financial benefits over on-premise architectures, including potential faster time to market, accelerated return on investment, and lower total cost of ownership for our customers.
•Scalable, Flexible Cloud Architecture. Our customers can collectively analyze billions of data points every second. Because we built our technology with a multi-tenant cloud architecture, customers can leverage its scale to rapidly run queries and get answers, without having to build their own expensive infrastructure.
•Application-centric View. Our focus on APM places us at what we believe to be the most complex and strategic layer of the digital stack. Our customers are rapidly adopting modern technologies at the infrastructure layer in service of running their application code and we provide them with visibility from the mobile application or browser through the application running in the cloud and down to the underlying infrastructure. Our other products work in concert with our APM product to provide a valuable holistic view of our customers’ environments. 
•Mobile Enabled. We provide a native mobile version of our products with nearly all functionality accessible and usable through mobile devices.
•Big Data Database and Analytics. Our proprietary, cloud-based database leverages modern big data technologies, which enable our users to collect, store, and analyze, as of March 31, 2019, approximately three trillion data points each day. Our schema-less database structure allows customers to easily build dashboards or make ad-hoc queries to deliver real-time insights.
•Easy and Intuitive. We design our products to be simple, intuitive, and user-friendly. Users are able to learn, deploy, and can begin using our products often within a few minutes. This is important for developers and operations teams who do not need to do extra coding or configuration to use our products. It is also important for business and technical users who can leverage our products to augment their existing knowledge of applications and infrastructure.
•Integrated Suite. Our products and platform capabilities share a common design and user interface and access the same cloud-based database structure. Users can move seamlessly among different analytic categories and use cases for their data. Users are able to easily add products to extend their ability to obtain insights from their same or new portions of their data.
Employees
As of March 31, 2019, we had 1,774 employees, including temporary employees. We also engage consultants. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Operations
We host our applications and serve all our customers from data centers located in the Chicago, Illinois area and, to a lesser extent, through our European Region in Germany and a combination of cloud hosting providers. We utilize third parties to manage the infrastructure at our data centers. We maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to ensure the security and integrity of our data, protect against security threats or data breaches, and prevent unauthorized access to the data of our customers. Our technology uses multi-tenant architecture, enabling all our customers to share the same version of our products and platform capabilities while securely partitioning their data.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, and testing of all aspects of the New Relic Platform suite of products and platform capabilities. We invest heavily in these efforts to continuously improve, innovate, and add new features to our solutions.
We deploy new features, functionality, and technologies through daily and weekly software releases or updates in order to minimize disruption and provide for constant improvement. Our product managers regularly engage with customers, partners, and industry analysts, as well as other stakeholders, in functions such as sales, customer success, marketing, and business development to understand customer needs as well as general trends in our industry. Once product improvements are identified, the development organization works closely together to design, develop, test, and launch a solution.
The majority of our research and development team is based in our Portland, Oregon office, but also has a significant presence in our offices in San Francisco, California and Barcelona, Spain. To foster rapid innovation, our team is further apportioned into smaller, agile development teams.
As of March 31, 2019, we had 472 employees in our research and development organization.

Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing organizations work together closely to drive market awareness, create and manage user and customer leads, provide qualified leads to our sales pipeline, and build customer relationships to drive revenue growth. As of March 31, 2019, we had 855 employees in our sales and marketing organization.
Sales
We sell our products to businesses of all sizes largely through our direct sales organization, with our primary focus on large enterprise companies. Our direct sales organization is organized by geography and size of customer and is focused on growing accounts and usage so as to provide our customers with a broader set of our product solutions.
Our sales organization has seIparate teams focused on mid-market organizations and large enterprises. Our specific sales strategy is based on the size of account and the target user at an organization (e.g., software developers, business or product managers, or IT managers).
Marketing
Our marketing strategy targets software developers, operations professionals, IT leaders, and technology executives across many industries and regions. Additionally, our events, demand generation, customer programs, corporate communications, and product marketing teams focus on building brand, engagement, and demand with our target markets. We utilize both online and offline marketing initiatives, including search engine and email marketing, online banner and video advertising, blogs, corporate communications, whitepapers, case studies, user events, sponsorships, and webinars. We believe an effective method to market our suite of products is for users to actively use and explore its capabilities. We encourage free trials of one or more of our products in order to successfully convert those accounts to paid subscriptions.
Seasonality
We have experienced increased seasonality in our sales and operating results as mid-market and enterprise customers have become a larger percentage of our revenues. The first two quarters of each fiscal year usually have lower or potentially negative sequential deferred revenue growth than the third and fourth fiscal quarters, during which we generally benefit from a larger renewal base and opportunity to up-sell existing customers. Over time that could lead to stronger sequential revenue results in our fourth and first fiscal quarters as our deferred revenue is recognized.
Customer Support
Our products and platform capabilities are designed to minimize the need for customer support, as users can easily download, install, and deploy our software agents without needing support. However, as we increase our customer account base with larger enterprises, these customers typically expect and require more support and accountability. We offer a range of customer support options with multiple levels of support. These include free community support, email support, and phone support, up to our enterprise customer support organization that provides dedicated customer success representatives, onsite support, with global capabilities and is available at all hours of the day. Through our training platform, we offer courses to help our customers quickly learn how to effectively use our products as well as implement best practices. Courses are available online, in-person at events, and, as requested by certain customers, on-site. Our training sessions are typically targeted at specific levels of employee seniority and product experience, such as agent essentials or administrator expert, to more effectively tailor training to intended audiences.
Partnerships and Strategic Relationships
We have built marketing relationships with a number of technology companies to help promote and grow our user base and footprint. We also have developed relationships with several cloud providers including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and others where we collaborate to ensure our products and platform capabilities work well on applications running on their clouds. These providers offer access to our products and platform capabilities through links on their websites, refer developers and other potential users to us, and expand our marketing reach. Additionally, a growing number of system integrators, consultants, and value-added resellers are using the New Relic Platform to help their customers make the resourcing and prioritization decisions necessary for successful cloud migrations and transformation projects.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry that is characterized by constant change and innovation. Changes in the applications and the programing languages used to develop applications, devices, operating systems, and technology landscape result in evolving customer requirements.

Our competitors fall into four primary categories:

• | performance monitoring providers such as AppDynamics, Inc. (an operating division of Cisco Systems, Inc.), Datadog, Inc., Dynatrace LLC, SignalFX, Inc., and Splunk Inc.;


• | diversified technology companies such as International Business Machines Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, and Oracle Corporation;


• | large enterprise software and service companies such as BMC Software, Inc. and CA, Inc. (a subsidiary of Broadcom, Inc.); and


• | companies offering analytics products competing with our New Relic Insights product, including Amazon Web Services, Inc., and Google LLC.

The principal competitive factors in our market include:

• | product and platform features, architecture, reliability, security, performance, effectiveness, and supported environments;


• | product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures;


• | digital operations expertise;


• | ease of use of products and platform capabilities;


• | total cost of ownership;


• | adherence to industry standards and certifications;


• | strength of sales and marketing efforts;


• | brand awareness and reputation; and


• | focus on customer success.

We believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, broader distribution, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.
Intellectual Property
We rely on federal, state, common law, and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology and algorithms by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties.
In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and domain names to protect our intellectual property. As of March 31, 2019, in the United States, we had two issued patents, fifteen patent applications pending, six trademark registrations, and two trademark applications. Concurrently, outside of the United States, we had six issued patents, two completed Patent Cooperation Treaty applications, twelve patent applications pending, including five Patent Cooperation Treaty applications, five trademark registrations, and seventeen trademark applications.
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.
Companies in Internet-related industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation, or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We are currently subject to, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
