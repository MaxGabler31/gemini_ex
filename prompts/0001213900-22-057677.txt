Item 1. Business.
Overview



We are a biotechnology company with an advanced cell-based technology platform. We have developed a unique three-dimensional, or 3D, technology platform for cell expansion with an industrial scale in-house Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, cell manufacturing facility. We are utilizing our technology in the field of regenerative medicine and food tech and plan to utilize it in other industries and verticals that have a need for our mass scale and cost-effective cell expansion platform.



We use our advanced cell-based technology platform in the field of regenerative medicine to develop placenta-based cell therapy product candidates for the treatment of inflammatory, muscle injuries and hematologic conditions. Our placental expanded, or PLX, cells are adherent stromal cells that are expanded using our 3D platform.  Our PLX cells can be administered to patients off-the-shelf, without blood or tissue matching or additional manipulation prior to administration. PLX cells are believed to release a range of therapeutic proteins in response to the patient’s condition.



Our operations are focused on the research, development and manufacturing of cells and cell-based products, conducting clinical studies and the business development of cell therapeutics and cell-based technologies, such as our recent collaboration with Tnuva Food Industries – Agricultural Cooperative in Israel Ltd., through its fully owned subsidiary, Tnuva Food-Tech Incubator (2019), Limited Partnership, or Tnuva, to use our technology to establish a cultivated food platform.



We expect to demonstrate a real-world impact and value from our cell-based technology platform, our current PLX pipeline and from other cell-based product candidates that may be developed based on our platform. Our business model for commercialization and revenue generation includes, but is not limited to, licensing deals, joint ventures, partnerships, joint development agreements and direct sale of our products.



We are now completing a multinational Phase III clinical study in muscle recovery following surgery for hip fracture, with sites in the United States, Europe and Israel. In the last year, we have completed a Phase II clinical study in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, or ARDS, associated with COVID-19 and a Phase I clinical study for incomplete recovery following bone marrow transplantation. Additional areas of focus for clinical development include an investigator-led Phase I/II Chronic Graft versus Host Disease, or cGVHD, study in Israel, and an Acute Radiation Syndrome, or ARS, program under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, animal rule. We believe that each of these indications represents a severe unmet medical need.



We were incorporated in Nevada on May 11, 2001. Pluri Inc. has a wholly owned subsidiary, Pluri Biotech Ltd., or the Subsidiary, previously named Pluristem Ltd., which is incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel. In January 2020, the Subsidiary established a wholly owned subsidiary, Pluristem GmbH, which is incorporated under the laws of Germany. In January 2022, the Subsidiary established an additional subsidiary, Plurinuva Ltd., or Plurinuva, which is incorporated under the laws of Israel, which followed the execution of the collaboration agreement with Tnuva . 



On July 26, 2022, we completed our legal entity name change from Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. to Pluri Inc., by merging a wholly-owned subsidiary with and into the Company, with us being the surviving corporation. The name change reflects a broader strategy of leveraging our 3D cell expansion technology to develop innovative cell-based products that can be harnessed for a range of fields beyond medicine, providing solutions for various areas of life. Effective July 26, 2022, our Nasdaq ticker symbol was changed to “PLUR.”



Scientific Background 



Cell therapy is an established field within the regenerative medicine area. The characteristics and properties of cells vary as a function of tissue source and growth conditions. The human placenta from which our PLX cells are derived provides an uncontroversial source of non-embryonic, adult cells and represents an innovative approach in the cell therapy field. The different factors that PLX cells release suggest that the cells can be used therapeutically for a variety of ischemic, inflammatory, autoimmune and hematological deficiencies.



PLX cells exhibit low immunogenicity, thus do not require tissue matching prior to administration, which allows the development of ready-to-use / “off-the-shelf” allogeneic products.

Our Technology 



Our PLX cells are adherent stromal cells that are expanded using a proprietary three-dimensional, or 3D, process. This system utilizes a synthetic scaffold to create an artificial 3D environment where placental-derived stromal cells can grow. Our automated proprietary 3D, cGMP approved, process enables the large-scale monitored and controlled production of reproducible, high quality cell products and can manufacture a large number of PLX doses. Additionally, our current manufacturing process, which has scaled up during the years, has demonstrated batch-to-batch consistency, an important manufacturing challenge for biological products.



Our technology platform, a patented and validated state-of-the-art 3D cell expansion system, aims to advance novel cell-based solutions for a range of initiatives, including, but not limited to, pharmaceuticals, climate change, food security and animal welfare. Our method is uniquely accurate, scalable, cost-effective, and consistent from batch to batch. Our technology is currently implemented in the fields of regenerative medicine and food-tech.



Product Candidates 



We believe that our technology will continue to fuel medical research and develop pharmaceuticals, while also being used to potentially create novel cell-based solutions for other innovative initiatives—such as food-tech, agri-tech, and biologics. We aim to establish partnerships that leverage our 3D cell-based technology to additional industries that require effective, mass cell production.
Pluri Health 



Our primary objective is to be the leading provider of allogeneic placenta-based cell therapy products that are true off-the-shelf products that do not require any matching or additional manipulation prior to administration. Currently, our PLX products are administered intramuscular, or IM, using a standard needle and syringe.
PLX-PAD



Our first product candidate, PLX-PAD, is composed of maternal cells originating from the placenta. PLX-PAD is used in a Phase III multinational clinical study in recovery following surgery for hip fracture.



PLX-PAD is also under clinical development in collaboration with Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital) through an investigator-initiated Phase I/II study for the treatment of Steroid-Refractory cGVHD.



PLX-R18



Our second product candidate, PLX-R18, is composed of fetal cells originating from the placenta.



We have completed our first in human Phase I clinical study in incomplete hematopoietic recovery following hematopoietic cell transplantation, or HCT, in the United States and Israel.



Through our collaboration in the United States with the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and the U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD, we are also developing a solution for ARS following or before exposure to massive radiation via the FDA Animal Rule regulatory pathway.



Modified PLX cells



In the last decade, we developed an allogeneic platform based on cells originated from the fetal and maternal cell from the placenta, and by using this platform we can produce large quantities of high-quality cells in automated and robust manufacturing process suitable for cGMP environment. As a platform technology company, we are currently developing additional product candidates, which are modified or induced PLX cells:



Induced PLX cells: we are using cells from the placenta, induced with cytokines, to transiently alter their secretion profile.



Modified PLX cells using CRISPR, or other gene editing technology: CRISPR is a unique technology which allows precise gene editing of cells. Using this technology, we can initiate the next evolution in cell therapy by allowing the reprograming of cells for specific needs. Our aim is to incorporate the genetic engineering techniques into our cell manufacturing platform in order to develop large scale allogenic engineered PLX products designed for specific indications.



We believe that using the placenta as a unique cell source, combined with our innovative research, development and high-quality manufacturing capabilities, will be the “engine” that drives this platform technology towards the successful development of additional PLX cell therapy products and indications.

Our Clinical Development Product Candidates 



Orthopedic Indications. Following FDA and European Medicine Agency, or EMA, clearance, a multinational Phase III study is currently being conducted in the United States, Europe and Israel. The primary endpoint of this study is the Short Physical Performance Battery, or SPPB, a test for lower limb performance and functional status. We completed enrollment of 240 patients and the study was designed to assess the efficacy at six months and a year, as well as safety for up to two years.



On July 13, 2022, we announced topline results from our Phase III study of muscle regeneration following hip fracture surgery. PLX-PAD was demonstrated to be an effective accelerator of muscle strength and regeneration. A significant increase in Hip Abduction Strength (HAS) was observed at week 26 and week 52 for patients treated with PLX-PAD (n=120), in the injured leg (p=0.047, p=0.0022) and uninjured leg (p=0.073, p=0.0046) compared to placebo (n=120). The study did not meet the primary endpoint, which was the SPPB test at week 26. The study will continue to follow up with patients for up to 52 weeks for safety and other efficacy measures.



Our Phase III study protocol and design was based on our phase I/II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (n=20) to assess the safety and efficacy of IM injections of allogeneic PLX-PAD cells for the regeneration of injured gluteal musculature after total hip replacement had been conducted in Germany under the approval of PEI. In this study, PLX-PAD cells or placebo were administered into the traumatized gluteal muscle during total hip replacement surgery. The study results met its primary efficacy endpoint, change in maximal voluntary isometric contraction force of the gluteal muscle at six months after total hip replacement. Patients treated with PLX-PAD had a significantly greater improvement of maximal voluntary muscle contraction force than the placebo group (p=0.0067). In addition, the study demonstrated that PLX-PAD was safe and well tolerated by patients.



COVID-19 Complicated by ARDS. In May 2020, the FDA cleared our Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, for a Phase II study of our PLX-PAD cells for treatment of severe COVID-19 cases complicated by ARDS and we initiated the study in June 2020. The U.S. study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IM injections of PLX-PAD for the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases complicated by ARDS. The primary endpoint is the number of ventilator free days, or VFD, from day 1 through day 28 of the study. Secondary efficacy endpoints include all-cause mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU free-days, and hospitalization free-days. Safety and survival follow-up will be conducted until week 52. In addition, the FDA has cleared our Expanded Access Program, or EAP, for the use of our PLX-PAD cells to treat ARDS caused by COVID-19 outside of the Phase II COVID-19 complicated by ARDS study in the United States. The EAP approval was for up to 100 patients.



In August 2020, the PEI cleared our Phase II study in Germany titled, “A Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter, Parallel-Group Phase II Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Intramuscular Injections of PLX PAD for the Treatment of severe COVID-19,” relating to the treatment of patients hospitalized with severe cases of COVID-19 complicated by ARDS. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the number of ventilator free days during the 28-days from day one through day 28 of the study. Secondary efficacy endpoints include all-cause mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU free-days, and hospitalization free-days. Safety and survival follow-up will be conducted until week 52. We enrolled patients in Europe and Israel under this protocol.



On July 8, 2021, we announced that we were bringing our COVID-19 complicated by ARDS Phase II studies in the United States, Europe and Israel to clinical readout. The analysis was based on 89 patients enrolled.



On December 27, 2021, we announced topline results for our COVID-19 studies based on 89 patients enrolled. The studies did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint of statistically significant improvement of VFD at 28 days. Taking into consideration the baseline risk factors of the ARDS patients, no differences in the safety profile were observed between PLX-PAD and placebo. The U.S. study was recently completed, and the second study conducted in Europe and Israel is planned for completion during the third calendar quarter of 2022.

Recovery Following HCT. This Phase I study of PLX-R18 in HCT was completed in the United States and Israel. The study assessed the safety of PLX-R18 by assessing adverse events, safety labs and vital signs in patients receiving different doses of PLX-R18. One year follow up for all patients was completed in September 2021 and the results of the study were announced on March 23, 2022. PLX-R18 was well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile. Patients treated with PLX-R18 showed a mean increase in all three blood cell types compared to baseline with platelets (p<0.001), hemoglobin (p=0.01) and neutrophils (p=0.15) levels increasing as early as 1 month following PLX-R18 administration and enduring up to 12 months following treatment. Additionally, the number of transfused units decreased from a mean monthly number of 5.09 for platelets and 2.91 for red blood cells at baseline to 0.55 for platelets (p=0.045) and 0 for red blood cells (p=0.0005) at 12 months.
Peripheral and Cardiovascular Diseases. We investigated the use of PLX-PAD cells for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease, or PAD, including IC and CLI. We completed two Phase I safety/dose-escalating clinical studies for CLI, one in the United States and one in Germany. These CLI studies demonstrated that no blood type or human leukocyte antigen matching is required, and that the administration of PLX-PAD cells is safe, even if two doses are administered to a patient on two different occasions. We completed a Phase II study in IC which was conducted in the United States, Germany, South Korea and Israel. A total of 172 patients were treated in this study. IM administration of PLX-PAD cells was concluded to be safe and well tolerated. We completed a pivotal Phase III study of PLX-PAD cells in the treatment of CLI for patients with minor tissue loss (Rutherford Category 5) who are unsuitable for revascularization. This multinational Phase III study was conducted in the United States, Europe and Israel and enrolled 213 patients in total. In December 2020, the independent Data Monitoring Committee, or DMC, issued its recommendation letter following an interim analysis relating to the CLI Phase III study. A clinical dataset was reviewed by the independent DMC for safety and analysis of the primary endpoint of amputation-free survival, defined as time to occurrence of major amputation of the index leg or death. Based on the review, the DMC concluded that the CLI study was unlikely to meet the primary endpoint by the time of the final analysis. Following the DMC’s recommendation, we decided to terminate the CLI study.
ARS. We have conducted several animal studies for the evaluation of PLX-R18 for the treatment of ARS, in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or the NIAID. The NIH funded and conducted a pilot study in non-human primates, or NHPs, to evaluate the therapeutic effect of PLX-R18 on hematological aspects of ARS. In 2017, we announced results of the NHPs pilot study for PLX-R18 as a treatment for ARS. Although study size was not designed to show significance, results showed a trend toward improved survival of PLX-R18 treated animals compared to control, placebo treated animals. The study, conducted and funded by the NIAID, was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of PLX-R18 following IM injection into irradiated and non-irradiated NHPs. Efficacy measures included survival as well as hematological parameters which are affected by exposure to high levels of radiation as may occur in a nuclear accident or attack. These data will help the design of a pivotal study to fulfill the requirements for a Biologics License Application, or BLA, submission under the FDA’s Animal Rule regulatory pathway.



We plan to continue the discussions with the different government agencies with the goal of receiving their support for pivotal studies in NHPs as well as conducting the safety studies required in order to file a BLA for this indication.



In October 2017, we announced that the FDA granted us an orphan drug designation for our PLX-R18 cell therapy for the prevention and treatment of ARS.



In April 2018, we announced that the FDA approved our IND application for PLX-R18 cell therapy in the treatment of ARS. The IND allows us to treat victims who may have been acutely exposed to high dose radiation due to nuclear attack or accident.



In July 2019, we presented positive results from a series of studies of our PLX-R18 cell therapy product conducted by the DoD Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, part of the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences. The studies were designed to evaluate PLX-R18 as a potential prophylactic countermeasure against ARS administered prior to radiation exposure. These animal studies demonstrate that PLX-R18, administered 24 hours before radiation exposure, and again 72 hours after exposure, resulted in a significant increase in survival rates, from 4% survival rate in the placebo group to 74% in the treated group. In addition, the data show an increase in recovery of blood lineages and a favorable safety profile. Furthermore, histopathological analysis and hematopoietic progenitor clonogenic assay of tissues collected show a significant increase in bone marrow cell numbers and improved regenerative capability into all blood lineages.

Steroid-Refractory cGVHD. In September 2017, we signed an agreement with Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital) to conduct a Phase I/II clinical study of PLX-PAD cell therapy for the treatment of Steroid-Refractory cGVHD. This study is an investigator-initiated study. As such, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center supports the study and is responsible for its design and implementation. 13 patients have been treated in this study to date.



Regulatory and Clinical Affairs Strategy 



Our cell therapy development strategy is to hold open and frequent discussions with regulators at all stages of development from preclinical studies to more advanced regulatory stages. We utilize this strategy in working with the FDA, the EMA, Germany’s PEI as well as other European national competent authorities, the MOH, Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA, and also the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, or MFDS, of South Korea.

In October 2021, we received approval for an additional grant of approximately $583,000 from the IIA pursuant to the CRISPR-IL consortium program, for an additional period of eighteen months.



The CRISPR-IL consortium program does not require us to pay royalties to the IIA.



United Arab Emirates-based Abu Dhabi Stem Cells Center



In August 2020, we signed a non-binding MOU with the United Arab Emirates-based Abu Dhabi Stem Cells Center, a specialist healthcare center focused on cell therapy and regenerative medicine. The aim of the collaboration is to capitalize on each party’s respective areas of expertise in cell therapies. The parties have agreed to exchange research results, share samples, join usage of equipment and testing, and other essential activities related to advancing the treatment and research of cell therapies for a broad range of medical conditions.
In-House Clinical Manufacturing



We have the in-house capability to perform clinical cell manufacturing. Our state-of-the-art Good GMP grade manufacturing facility in Haifa has been in use since February 2013 for the main purpose of clinical grade, large-scale manufacturing. The facility’s new automated manufacturing process and products were approved for production of PLX-PAD for clinical use by the FDA, EMA, MFDS, PMDA and the MOH. Our second product, PLX-R18, was cleared by the FDA and the MOH for clinical use. Furthermore, the site was inspected and approved by a European Union qualified person (European accreditation body), approving that the site and production processes meet the current GMP for the purpose of manufacturing clinical grade products.



The site was also inspected and approved by the MOH and we received a cGMP Certification and manufacturer-importer authorization.





12






We obtain the human placentas used for our research and manufacturing activities from various hospitals in Israel after receiving a written informed consent by the mother and pathogen clearance. Any medical waste related to the use of placentas is treated in compliance with local environmental laws and standards.



We have developed a serum-free formulation to support the manufacturing of cell therapy products. This serum-free formulation was developed using our deep understanding in cell therapy industrial scale production standards, and the quality methods designed to support implementation in Phase III development and marketing. Achieving this significant technological challenge is expected to provide us with large-scale, highly consistent production capacity with operational independency from third party suppliers for standard serum, an expensive and quantity limited product. PLX-R18 is the first product candidate manufactured using the serum-free media.



Government Regulation 



The development, manufacturing, and future marketing of our cell therapy product candidates are subject to the laws and regulations of governmental authorities in the United States, Europe and Israel, as well as other countries in which our products may be marketed in the future like Japan, and South Korea. In addition, the manufacturing conditions are specifically inspected by the MOH.



The FDA and the EMA must approve products prior to marketing. Furthermore, various governmental statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage and record keeping related to such products and their marketing. Governments in other countries have similar requirements for testing and marketing.



The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time, resources and money. There can be no assurance that our product candidates will ultimately receive marketing approval, or, if approved, will be reimbursed by public and private health insurance.



There are several stages every drug undergoes during its development process. Among these are:




● | Performance of nonclinical laboratory and animal studies to assess a drug’s biological activity and to identify potential safety concerns, and to characterize and document the product’s chemistry, manufacturing controls, formulation, and stability. In accordance with regulatory requirements, nonclinical safety and toxicity studies are conducted under Good Laboratory Practice, requirements to ensure their quality and reliability;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The manufacture of the product according to GMP regulations and standards;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Potential post-marketing clinical testing and surveillance of the product after marketing approval, which can result in additional conditions on the approvals or suspension of clinical use.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






13






Approval of a drug for clinical studies in humans and approval of marketing are sovereign decisions of states, made by national, or, in case of the European Union, international regulatory competent authorities.



The Regulatory Process in the United States



In the United States, our product candidates are subject to regulation as a biological product under the Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA, regulating the approval of clinical studies and marketing applications in the United States, generally requires the following steps prior to approving a new biological product for use either for clinical studies or for commercial sale:

● | Submission of an IND Application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Obtaining approval of Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs, of research institutions or other clinical sites to introduce the drug candidate into humans in clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA may grant approval for EAP prior to the completion of clinical studies, in order to allow access for the investigational drug, for patients that are excluded from the study;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA may grant priority review status to expedite the BLA review process. Obtaining a Fast Track designation allows access for the request of priority review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission of a BLA for marketing authorization of the product, which must include adequate results of pre-clinical testing and clinical studies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission of BLA with a proof of efficacy that is based only on animal studies is feasible in instances where human efficacy studies cannot be conducted because the conduct of such studies is unethical and field studies after an accidental or deliberate exposure are not feasible;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review of the BLA in order to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective for its intended uses; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA inspection and approval of the product manufacturing facility at which the product will be manufactured.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Regulatory Process in Europe



In the European Union, our investigational cellular products are regulated under the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product regulation, a regulation specific to cell and tissue products. Additionally, as of January 31, 2022, conducting clinical studies within EMA countries is subject to clinical trials regulation. This European Union regulation requires:

● | Filing a Central Clinical Trial Application utilizing the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) and obtaining an assessment and approval; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Obtaining approval of local and central ethics committees as required to test the investigational product into humans in clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Conducting adequate and well-controlled clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for its intended use; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Since our investigational cellular products are regulated under the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product regulation, the application for marketing authorization to the EMA is mandatory within the 28 member states of the European Union. The EMA is expected to review and approve the MAA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In May 2015, we were selected by the EMA for development of PLX-PAD cells via the EMA Adaptive Pathways Project.

Other Regulations



In general, the approval procedure varies among countries, and may involve additional preclinical testing and clinical studies. The requirements and time required may differ from those required for FDA or EMA approval. Each country may impose certain procedures and requirements of its own. Most countries other than the United States, the European Union and Japan are willing to consider requests for marketing approval only after the product had been approved for marketing by either the FDA, the EMA or the PMDA. The decision regarding marketing approval is made following the submission of a dossier that is thoroughly assessed and critically addressed.



In Japan, we have completed the required regulatory interactions with the PMDA, prior to the submission of clinical study notification, in the framework of the new regulations for regenerative therapy effective in November 2014, which promote expedited approval for regenerative therapies that are being developed for seriously debilitating/life-threatening indications.



Clinical Studies



Typically, in the United States, as well as in the European Union, clinical development involves a three-phase process, although the phases may overlap. Phase I, clinical studies are conducted in a small number of healthy volunteers, or patients in cases of ethical issues with using healthy volunteers and are designed to provide information about product safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body.



Phase II clinical studies are conducted in a homogenous group of patients afflicted with the specific target disease, to explore preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and confirm the safety profile. In some cases, an initial study is conducted in patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety and patterns of drug metabolism and distribution, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II study. Phase III clinical studies are generally large-scale, multi-center, controlled studies conducted with a heterogeneous group of patients afflicted with the target disease, aiming to provide statistically significant support of efficacy, as well as safety and potency. The Phase III studies are considered confirmatory for establishing the efficacy and safety profile of the drug and are critical for approval. In some circumstances, a regulatory agency may require Phase IV, or post-marketing studies in case additional information needs to be collected after the drug is on the market.



During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical study sites investigators to minimize risks and ensure high quality and integrity of the collected data. The sponsor of a clinical study is required to submit an annual safety report to the relevant regulatory agencies, in which serious adverse events are reported, and also to submit in an expedited manner any individual serious adverse events that are suspected to be related to the tested drug and are unexpected with its use. An agency may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the clinical study based upon the data that have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient.



Employees



As of June 30, 2022, we employed a total of 154 full-time employees and 5 part-time employees, of whom, 128 full-time employees and 5 part-time employees are engaged in research and development, manufacturing and clinical development.




As of August 30, 2022, we employed a total of 129 full-time employees and 6 part-time employees, of whom, 102 full-time employees and 6 part-time employees are engaged in research and development, manufacturing and clinical development.



The reduction in the number of our employees was part of an efficiency and cost reduction plan we initiated in June 2022.

Competition 



Our legacy product candidates have focused on the regenerative medicine field. The regenerative medicine field is characterized by intense competition, as global and local pharma players are becoming more engaged in the cell therapy field based on the advancements made in clinical studies and due to the favorable regenerative medicine legislation in certain regions. We face competition from both allogeneic and autologous cell therapy companies, academic, commercial and research institutions, pharmaceutical companies, biopharmaceutical companies, and governmental agencies. Some of the clinical indications we currently have under development are also being investigated in preclinical and clinical programs by others.



While there are hundreds of companies in the regenerative medicine space globally, there are multiple participants in the cell therapy field based in the United States, Europe, Japan, Korea, and Australia such as Athersys Inc., Celularity Inc., Tigenix NV (acquired by Takeda), SanBio Inc. and Mesoblast Ltd. Among other things, we expect to compete based upon our intellectual property portfolio, our in-house manufacturing efficiencies and capabilities, and the efficacy of our products. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain experienced and skilled executives, scientific and clinical development personnel, to identify and develop viable cellular therapeutic candidates, and exploit these products commercially. Given the magnitude of the potential opportunity for cell therapy, we expect competition in this area to intensify.




More recently, through our collaboration with Tnuva and the establishment of Plurinuva, we have begun to utilize our technology in the food tech field. Competitors in the cultivated meat domain include both producers of consumer-end-products, as well as those developing inputs for the production process. Plurinuva competes with companies that include Upside Foods, Future Meat, GOOD Meat, Mosa Meat, Aleph Farms, and Gourmey.



We believe that our ability to compete in the food tech field will derive from our experienced team, our unique 3D technology platform, and our industrial scale in-house GMP, cell manufacturing facility, together with our partner, Tnuva, which has vast experience in the food business.




Impact of COVID-19



In managing our ongoing global clinical studies, as well as our daily operations, in the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, we are taking all necessary precautions for the safety and well-being of patients, healthcare providers involved in our studies, and our employees. We are continuing our operational and manufacturing activities, subject to the directives of the MOH, with a dedicated team on site at our facilities. In addition, the majority of our employees have been vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 and we are using remote work technologies that enable the mitigation of office staff while allowing other activities to be conducted without the need for a physical presence in our facilities, if necessary. The COVID-19 global pandemic caused delays in enrollment of some of our clinical studies. In addition, we are following the FDA and EMA guidelines regarding the management of clinical studies during COVID-19. However, the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic is constantly evolving, and we may experience further impacts on our daily operations, including the need for employees to potentially self-isolate based on potential exposure to the virus, difficulties for our employees in travelling abroad, and delays in our ongoing research work with various hospitals and academic institutions.
