Item 1.  Description of Business

Karbon-X Corp (or "Karbon-X" or "the Company") is a public Nevada corporation that offers investors exposure to VERRA Certified carbon credits which are a key instrument used by both individuals and corporations to achieve their carbon neutral and net-zero carbon goals. The company is environmental and social governance (ESG) principled and focuses on partnering with high-quality projects and/or companies that generate or are actively involved in the voluntary carbon credit market.

The Company intends to invest capital into projects that have proven C02 reduction potential and that may not have been otherwise developed. The majority of these projects have significant social and economic benefits in addition to their carbon reduction or removal potential.

Karbon-X Corp is focused on customized transactional options for corporations to offset their carbon footprint and provides scalable access to the Verified Emissions Reduction markets. Karbon-X is changing the marketing framework of traditional carbon marketing by engaging with the public in order to fund multiple forms of technology based greenhouse gas reduction builds.

Carbon Credit Generation

Karbon-X Corp purchases verified carbon credits from numerous vendors and then resells to both industry and the general public. The Company has already begun funding projects in order to generate Karbon-X Corp carbon credits of its own. Once verified these projects will generate carbon credits that will be sold on its proprietary APP platform.

Competition

Many of our competitors have greater resources that may enable them to compete more effectively than us in the carbon credit industry.

The industry in which we operate is subject to intense and increasing competition. Some of our competitors have a longer operating history and greater capital resources and facilities, which may enable them to compete more effectively in this market. We expect to face additional competition from existing licensees and new market entrants, who are not yet active in the industry. If a significant number of competitors develop, we may experience increased competition for market share and may experience downward pricing pressure on our products as new entrants increase production. Such competition may cause us to encounter difficulties in generating revenues and market share, and in positioning our products in the market. If we are unable to successfully compete with existing companies and new entrants to the market, our lack of competitive advantage will have a negative effect on our business and financial condition.

We have identified many of our key competitors including the following:

Indigo Carbon

As the name most recognized name in the farming community, Indigo Carbon has an impressive list of well known corporate buyers like The North Face, Blue Bottle Coffee, and JP Morgan Chase. While Indigo is touted as a leader in the emerging industry, it may not be the best option for all. Indigo carbon has a proprietary software platform that allows farmers to easily input data from enrolled fields. After enrolling, farmers have access to Indigo’s agronomists and support teams to help implement changes and answer questions. Farmers only get paid for adopting new practices (ie. cover cropping, no-till, reduced N fertilizer, etc.), so if a farmer has been cover cropping for years, they are unlikely to be eligible. Right now they only service specific states (Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Texas).

Nori

Nori is a blockchain-enabled company whose sole mission is to be a leading carbon marketplace. Unique to the carbon-removal industry, they are powered by cryptocurrency. Through this pioneering approach, they hope to create efficient and transparent carbon removal transactions. Companies can purchase NORI tokens (whose price depends on the market price of a carbon removal credit at time of purchase). Once it has a NORI token, the company can exchange it for an NRT (or Nori Removal Token). Farmers create NRTs when they sequester 1 ton of CO2. That NRT translates into a NORI token which is priced at market value and can be sold.

TruCarbon by TruTerra

TruTerra is a subsidiary of Land O’Lakes – the world’s largest farmer owned cooperative. The current state of the program is only available to farmers with data from 2016-2020. They have a tool called Truterra Insights Engine that allows farmers to aggregate data from the past five years in a format best suited to enroll in a carbon program. Enrollment is contingent upon committing to a 20 year reporting period using the Truterra Insights Engine (carbon reporting contracts are similar to conservation easements, meaning that they can be transferred in the case of transfer of property).

Bayer Carbon Initiative

Bayer’s recently announced Carbon Initiative is still in its beginning phases with very little public detail. That said, they (like many of the other carbon credit companies on this list), will only pay farmers for adopting new cover crop or no-till/strip till practices. Bayer is a hugely influential food and agriculture company in its own right, so they have the resources and expertise to roll out a strong program after this pilot season.
Nutrien Ag

Nutrien’s core businesses are creating seeds, fertilizers, herbicides, and software to optimize farm performance. In November 2020 they announced their involvement in the carbon marketplace. Nutrien has a deep bench of agronomists on staff to provide guidance for newly enrolled farmers, so entering the market may have additional benefits for farmers looking for guidance on how best to sequester carbon. As a global retailer they have plenty of connections to influential companies who might be interested in purchasing carbon credits once the program is officially launched.
Carbon Streaming Corp

Under stream agreements, Carbon Streaming Corp. makes upfront and ongoing delivery payments to project developers for future carbon credits. This financing structure creates carbon credit projects that reduce emissions in a sustainable manner. Our streams and investments then provide us with a diversified portfolio of carbon credits with exposure to potential rising carbon prices.

Base Carbon

Base Carbon partners with corporations, sovereign entities, academic institutions and carbon reduction project developers to produce and commercialize verified carbon credits. Base Carbon differentiates itself through sourcing and underwriting and financing the maturation of nature and technology based carbon reduction credit projects. Base Carbon seeks to simplify the carbon credit economy and become a financier within the voluntary carbon markets.
Climeworks

Climeworks develops, builds and operates direct air capture machines. Climeworks captures carbon dioxide directly from the air; removing CO2 emissions. The air-captured carbon dioxide can either be recycled and used as a raw material, or completely removed from the air by safely storing it. Climework’s machines consist of modular CO2 collectors that can be stacked to build machines of any size.

Sales

The Company’s two main revenue streams include industrial sales and subscription-based sales through a mobile APP.

Industrial Sales

Karbon-X Corp primarily operates in the voluntary carbon offset market. The Company sells carbon offsets to mining, forestry, civic earthworks, transportation and oil and gas servicing companies based on their total fossil fuel consumption for individual projects. This simple platform offers companies a way to reach their carbon neutrality goals while supporting CO2 reducing projects for years to come.

When companies purchase carbon offsets from Karbon-X Corp directly to offset their fossil fuel consumption the credits are retired in the name of the customer which provides transparency.

Subscription Based Sales

The general public will be able purchase carbon offsets from a mobile APP that is subscription based, with multiple levels of investment for every budget. Each subscription will support C02 reducing projects such as direct air capture, green hydroelectric energy production, or reforestation and will reduce greenhouse gas emissions with provable, verifiable carbon credits.

Karbon-X Corp allows the general public to offset their greenhouse gas emissions from daily life with an subscriber-based APP which is shareable on social media.
