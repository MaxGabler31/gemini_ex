Item 1. Business 
General 
Owens & Minor, Inc. and subsidiaries (we, us or our), a Fortune 500 company headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, is a leading global healthcare solutions company that connects the world of medical products to the point of care. We provide vital supply chain assistance to the providers of healthcare services and the manufacturers of healthcare products, supplies and devices. With fully developed networks in the United States and Europe, we are equipped to serve a customer base ranging from hospitals, integrated healthcare systems, group purchasing organizations, and the U.S. federal government, to manufacturers of life-science and medical devices and supplies, including pharmaceuticals in certain markets. The description of our business should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and supplementary data included in this Form 10-K. 
 Founded in 1882, Owens & Minor was incorporated in 1926 in Richmond, Virginia. We focus our operations on healthcare logistics services and provide our customers with a service portfolio that covers procurement, inventory management, delivery and sourcing of products for the healthcare market. Through organic growth and acquisitions over many years, we significantly expanded and strengthened our company, achieving national scale in the United States healthcare market. In 2012, through the acquisition of the Movianto Group (Movianto), we entered into third-party logistics services for the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries in the European market, leveraging an existing platform that also expands our ability to serve our United States-based manufacturer customers on an international level. In 2014, we completed the acquisitions of Medical Action Industries Inc. (Medical Action), a leading producer of surgical kits and procedure trays for the healthcare market, and ArcRoyal, a privately held surgical kitting company based in Ireland. These acquisitions further expanded our capabilities to offer our provider and manufacturer customers a range of kitting options.
In the third quarter of 2017, we completed the acquisition of Byram Healthcare (Byram), a leading domestic distributor of disposable medical supplies sold directly to patients and home health agencies. This acquisition expanded our capabilities beyond the hospital setting all the way to the patient's home with principal product lines of ostomy, wound care, diabetes, urology and incontinence supplies. We report Byram in our Domestic segment.
On October 31, 2017, we entered into a Purchase Agreement to acquire the Surgical and Infection Prevention (S&IP) business of Halyard Health, Inc. (Halyard) for $710 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the Purchase Agreement. Halyard’s S&IP business is a leading global provider of medical supplies and solutions for the prevention of healthcare-associated infections across the acute and alternate site channels. The transaction is expected to close early in the second quarter of 2018.
We report our business under three distinct business units: Domestic, International and Proprietary Products (formerly Clinical and Procedural Solutions). Domestic is our U.S. distribution, logistics and value-added services business, while International is our European distribution, logistics and value-added services business. Proprietary Products provides product-related solutions, including surgical and procedural kitting and sourcing. Financial information by segment and geographic area appears in Note 19, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report. 
The Domestic Segment
Healthcare product volumes in the United States are dependent on the rates of utilization of medical/surgical procedures by consumers, which are subject to fluctuation according to the condition of the domestic economy and other factors such as changes in regulation affecting reimbursement. Aside from consumer-driven activity, the healthcare industry is also experiencing growing demand for advanced logistics and inventory management services as healthcare providers and manufacturers are focused on achieving more efficient and cost-effective supply-chain operations.
In the United States, healthcare supply distributors contract with group purchasing organizations (GPOs) that negotiate distribution contracts on behalf of their healthcare provider members and also contract directly with healthcare providers and manufacturers for their services. Healthcare providers are increasingly consolidating into larger, more sophisticated networks that are actively seeking reductions in the total cost of delivering healthcare products. These healthcare providers face complex financial challenges, including managing the cost of purchasing, receiving, storing and tracking supplies.

Economic trends have also driven significant consolidation within the healthcare products distribution and logistics industry due to the competitive advantages enjoyed by larger organizations. Among these advantages are the ability to serve customers in widespread geographic locations, purchase inventory in large volume, develop more sophisticated technology platforms and decision-support systems and provide expertise to healthcare providers and manufacturers to help reduce supply chain costs. 
We offer a comprehensive portfolio of products and services to healthcare providers and manufacturers in the United States. Our portfolio of medical and surgical supplies includes branded products purchased in large volume from manufacturers and our own proprietary private-label products, which are internally sourced through our sourcing capabilities abroad or through a select group of manufacturers. We store our products at our distribution centers and provide delivery of these products, along with related services, to healthcare providers around the nation. 
Most supplies are delivered using a leased fleet and almost all of our delivery personnel are our teammates, ensuring a consistent level of performance and customer service. In situations where they are more cost-effective and timely, we use contract carriers and parcel delivery services. We customize product deliveries, whether the orders are “just-in-time,” “low-unit-of-measure,” pallets, or truckloads. We also customize delivery schedules according to customers’ needs to increase their efficiency in receiving and storing products.  We have deployed low-unit-of-measure automated picking modules in our larger distribution centers to maximize efficiency, and our distribution center teammates use voice-pick technology to enhance speed and accuracy in performing certain warehousing processes. 
We also offer additional services to healthcare providers including supplier management, analytics, inventory management, outsourced resource management, clinical supply management and business process consulting. These value-add services help providers improve their process for contracting with vendors, purchasing supplies and streamlining inventory. These services include our operating room-focused inventory management program that helps healthcare providers manage suture and endo-mechanical inventory, as well as our customizable surgical supply service that includes the kitting and delivery of surgical supplies in procedure-based totes to coincide with the healthcare providers' surgical schedule. 
 The majority of our distribution arrangements compensate us on a cost-plus percentage basis, under which a negotiated percentage mark-up is added to the contract cost of the product agreed to by the customer and the supplier. We price our services for certain other arrangements under activity-based pricing models. In these cases, pricing depends upon the type, level and/or complexity of services that we provide to customers, and in some cases we do not take title to the product (although we maintain certain custodial risks). As a result, this fee-for-service pricing model aligns the fees we charge with the cost of the services provided, which is a component of distribution, selling and administrative expenses, rather than with the cost of the product, which is a component of cost of goods sold.
We offer a variety of programs and services dedicated to providing logistics and marketing solutions to our manufacturer customers as well. These programs and services are designed to help manufacturers drive sales growth, increase market share and achieve operational efficiencies. Manufacturer programs are generally negotiated on an annual basis and provide for enhanced levels of support that are aligned with the manufacturer’s annual objectives and growth goals. We have contractual arrangements with manufacturers participating in these programs that provide performance-based incentives to us, as well as cash discounts for prompt payment. Program incentives can be earned on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. 
All of our distribution and logistics services utilize a common infrastructure of distribution centers, equipment, technology, and delivery methods (internal fleet, common carrier or parcel services). We operate a network of over 40 distribution centers located throughout the continental United States, which are strategically located to efficiently serve our provider and manufacturer customers. A significant investment in information technology supports our business including warehouse management systems, customer service and ordering functions, demand forecasting programs, electronic commerce, data warehousing, decision support and supply-chain management. 
Through our acquisition of Byram Healthcare, we have expanded our business along the continuum of care through delivery of disposable medical supplies sold directly to patients and home health agencies. Byram specializes in various patient care product lines including ostomy, wound care, diabetes, urology, incontinence and enteral. We receive payments for products sold through Byram from the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans, private insurers and directly from patients. Byram has a nationwide sales force, focusing on managed care and key referral sources, six centers of excellence aligned with specific product categories, and a nationwide network to optimize shipping distance and time.

The International Segment 
Our International segment includes our European distribution and logistics business. We provide contract logistics services to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries, offering a broad range of supply chain logistics services to manufacturers. Our business services include order-to-cash, re-labeling, customer service and returns management. Our warehousing and transportation offerings include storage, controlled-substance handling, cold-chain, emergency and export delivery, inventory management and pick & pack services. 
Client logistics contracts in our International segment are generally for three-year terms with rolling automatic one- year extension periods. The tendering or competitive bidding process typically takes 12 to 18 months from the initial client request for proposal until becoming operational. We offer significant flexibility to tailor contracts to specific client requirements, and benefit from the expansion of clients into additional European countries. Pricing may be activity-based, with fees determined by clients’ particular requirements for warehousing, handling and delivery services, or it may be based on buy-sell wholesaler arrangements for product distribution. 
Our International segment has a network of 19 logistics centers serving customers in 12 European countries, including Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. To serve our clients, we use a fleet of leased and owned trucks, including cold-chain delivery trucks. The majority of our drivers are our International teammates, although contract carriers and parcel services are used in situations where they are more cost-effective and timely. 
Proprietary Products 
Our Proprietary Products segment provides product-related solutions, helping manufacturers and healthcare providers source, assemble and deliver procedure kits efficiently and effectively to the point-of-care. Our facilities in the U.S. and Ireland offer the combining of instruments and supplies into kits and trays which are assembled and delivered based on the specifications of U.S. based provider customers, as well as manufacturers and providers across Europe. These custom procedure trays (CPT) serve a wide number of surgical specialties, including robotics, orthopedics, cardiology, cath labs, gastric, laproscopic and labor and delivery. We also offer minor procedure kits, which give complete cost-saving solutions for the delivery of procedure-specific components, with more than 1,800 possible configurations assembled to meet the industry's most stringent standards. We operate two kitting facilities in the U.S and one in Ireland. For sterilized kits and trays, we utilize one or more third-party sterilization contractors. 
Through our global sourcing services, based in Ireland with teams in Asia and the U.S., we work with a wide range of manufacturers around the world to offer an expanding portfolio of proprietary products and sourcing services for manufacturers and provider customers. Our full range of sourcing services include: manufacturing capacity management, container load optimization, customs compliance assurance and more. We offer our own proprietary brands of products across a wide spectrum of categories, including patient care, O.R. protection, and labor and delivery. By offering a single brand for thousands of regularly purchased items, we can increase efficiency and support product standardization initiatives.
Our products are typically purchased pursuant to purchase orders or supply agreements in which the purchaser specifies whether such products are to be supplied through a distributor or directly. This segment may sell on an intercompany basis to our other segments when we are the designated distributor, to other third-party distributors or directly to healthcare providers and manufacturers.

Our Customers 
We currently provide distribution, kitting, outsourced resource management and/or consulting services to thousands of healthcare provider customers. These customers include multi-facility networks of healthcare providers offering a broad spectrum of healthcare services to a particular market or markets (IDNs) as well as smaller, independent hospitals in the United States. In addition to contracting with healthcare providers at the IDN level and through GPOs, we also contract with other types of healthcare providers including surgery centers, physicians’ practices and smaller networks of hospitals that have joined together to negotiate terms. We have contracts to provide distribution services to the members of a number of national GPOs, including Vizient, Premier, Inc. (Premier) and HealthTrust Purchasing Group (HPG). In 2017, we renewed the distribution agreement with one of these GPOs to continue our status as an authorized distributor for their member healthcare providers and allow us to compete with other authorized distributors for the business of individual members. Below is a summary of these agreements: 

GPO | Year of Renewal | Term | Sales to Members as a % of Consolidated Net Revenue in 2017
Vizient | 2016 | 3 years | 43% 
Premier | 2016 | 5 years | 21% 
HPG | 2017 | 4 years | 14% 

We have our own independent relationships with most of our hospital customers through separate contractual commitments that may or may not be based upon the terms of our agreement with the GPO. As a result, the termination or expiration of an agreement with a particular GPO would not necessarily mean that we would lose the members of such GPO as our customers. 
Our supplier and manufacturer customers represent the largest and most influential healthcare manufacturers in the industry. We have long-term relationships with these important companies in the healthcare supply chain and have long provided traditional distribution services to them. We currently have relationships with approximately 1,100 supplier and manufacturer customers. In the Domestic segment, sales of products supplied by Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson and Becton Dickinson accounted for approximately 11%, 9% and 9%, respectively of our consolidated net revenue for 2017.
In Europe, we serve a diverse customer base of approximately 600 manufacturer clients, including pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device manufacturers. 
 Asset Management 
In the healthcare supply distribution industry, a significant investment in inventory and accounts receivable is required to meet the rapid delivery requirements of customers and provide high-quality service. As a result, efficient asset management is essential to our profitability. We continually work to refine our processes to optimize inventory and collect accounts receivable. 
Inventory 
We are focused in our efforts to optimize inventory and continually consolidate products and collaborate with supply-chain partners on inventory productivity initiatives. When we convert large-scale, multi-state IDN customers to our distribution network, an additional investment in inventory in advance of expected sales is generally required. We actively monitor inventory for obsolescence and use inventory turnover and other operational metrics to measure our performance in managing inventory. 
Accounts Receivable 
In the normal course of business, we provide credit to our U.S. and European customers and use credit management techniques to evaluate customers’ creditworthiness and facilitate collection. These techniques may include performing initial and ongoing credit evaluations of customers based primarily on financial information provided by them and from sources available to the general public. We also use third-party information from sources such as credit reporting agencies, banks and other credit references. We actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize credit risk, days sales outstanding (DSO) and accounts receivable carrying costs. Our ability to accurately invoice and ship product to customers enhances our collection results and affects our DSO performance. As we diversify our customer portfolio, the change in business mix also affects our DSO. We have arrangements with certain customers under which they make deposits on account, either because they do not meet our standards for creditworthiness or in order to obtain more favorable pricing.

Competition
The industries in which we operate are highly competitive in the United States and Europe. The U.S. sector includes Owens & Minor, Inc., as well as two major nationwide manufacturers who also provide distribution services, Cardinal Health, Inc. and privately-held Medline, Inc. In addition, we compete with a number of regional and local distributors, companies that distribute products to patient's homes and customer self-distribution models. Major logistics competitors serving healthcare manufacturers in the United States and in Europe include United Parcel Service, FedEx Corporation, Deutsche Post DHL and Alloga, as well as local competitors in specific countries. 
Regulation
The medical/surgical supply distribution, healthcare logistics and healthcare services industries in the United States are subject to regulation by federal, state and local government agencies. Each of our distribution centers is licensed to distribute medical and surgical supplies, as well as certain pharmaceutical and related products, and each of our Proprietary Products kitting facilities is licensed to perform kit assembly operations. We must comply with laws and regulations, including those governing operations, storage, transportation, manufacturing, sales, safety and security standards for each of our distribution centers and kitting facilities, of the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and state boards of pharmacy, or similar state licensing boards and regulatory agencies. We are also subject to various federal and state laws intended to protect the privacy of health or other personal information and to prevent healthcare fraud and abuse. We believe we are in material compliance with all statutes and regulations applicable to our operations. 
Our operations outside the U.S. are subject to local, country and European-wide regulations, including those promulgated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Medical Devices Directive. In addition, quality requirements are imposed by healthcare industry manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies which audit our operations on a regular basis. Each of our logistics centers in Europe is licensed to distribute medicinal, medical and surgical supplies, as well as certain pharmaceutical and related products, according to the country-specific requirements. Our logistics centers in Europe are able to store ambient, cold-chain or deep frozen products, are licensed to distribute narcotic and other pharmaceutical products included in clinical trials and are licensed for secondary packaging activities for medicinal products. Movianto is also ISO 9001:2008 certified across the entire enterprise. Our Ireland-based Proprietary Products kitting facility is licensed to assemble kits and sell them in the markets we serve and operates in compliance with the requirements of ISO 9001:2008 and ISO/EU 13485:2012 standards. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations, as well as prevailing industry best practices, in the conduct of our European business operations.
 Employees
At the end of 2017, we employed approximately 6,200 full- and part-time teammates in the U.S. and 2,400 outside of the U.S. Most of our teammates outside the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We continue to have positive relationships with teammates and European works councils.
