Item 1. Business.
General Development of Business
Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (“TripCo” or the “Company”) was formed in 2013 as a Delaware corporation. TripCo was a subsidiary of Liberty Interactive Corporation (subsequently renamed Qurate Retail, Inc. (“Qurate Retail”)) until the completion of its spin-off from Qurate Retail on August 27, 2014 (“TripCo Spin-Off”). Following the TripCo Spin-Off, Qurate Retail and TripCo operate as separate, publicly traded companies, and neither has any stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. TripCo does not have any operations outside of its controlling interest in its subsidiary, Tripadvisor, Inc. (“Tripadvisor”). As of December 31, 2021, TripCo held an approximate 21% economic interest and 57% voting interest in Tripadvisor.
In connection with the TripCo Spin-Off, TripCo entered into certain agreements, including the services agreement, the facilities sharing agreement and the tax sharing agreement, with Qurate Retail and/or Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty Media”) (or certain of their subsidiaries) in order to govern certain of the ongoing relationships between the companies after the TripCo Spin-Off and to provide for an orderly transition.
Pursuant to the services agreement (except as described below in respect to Gregory B. Maffei), Liberty Media provides TripCo with general and administrative services including legal, tax, accounting, treasury and investor relations support. TripCo reimburses Liberty Media for direct, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Liberty Media in providing these services and TripCo pays a services fee to Liberty Media under the services agreement that is subject to adjustment semi-annually, as necessary. 
In December 2019, TripCo entered into an amendment to the services agreement with Liberty Media in connection with Liberty Media’s entry into a new employment arrangement with Gregory B. Maffei, TripCo’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Under the amended services agreement, components of his compensation would either be paid directly to him by each of TripCo, Liberty Broadband Corporation (“LBC”), and Qurate Retail (collectively, the “Service Companies”) or reimbursed to Liberty Media, in each case, based on allocations among Liberty Media and the Service Companies set forth in the amended services agreement. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the allocation percentage for TripCo was 5% in each year. The amended services agreement between Liberty Media and Mr. Maffei provides for a five year employment term which began on January 1, 2020 and ends December 31, 2024, with an aggregate annual base salary of $3 million (with no contracted increase), an aggregate one-time cash commitment bonus of $5 million (paid in December 2019), an aggregate annual target cash performance bonus of $17 million, aggregate annual equity awards of approximately $18 million and aggregate equity awards granted in connection with his entry into his new agreement of $90 million (the “upfront awards”). A portion of the grants made to our CEO in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 related to our Company’s allocable portion of these upfront awards.
Under the facilities sharing agreement, TripCo shares office space with Liberty Media and related amenities at Liberty Media’s corporate headquarters in Englewood, Colorado. 
On March 15, 2020, TripCo and Gregory B. Maffei entered into an Investment Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with Certares Holdings LLC, Certares Holdings (Blockable) LLC and Certares Holdings (Optional) LLC with respect to an investment in TripCo’s newly-created 8% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) which was later assigned to Certares LTRIP LLC (“Certares” or the “Purchaser”). Pursuant to the assigned Investment Agreement, on March 26, 2020, TripCo issued 325,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Certares for a purchase price of $1,000 per share.  On March 29, 2021 and April 6, 2021, TripCo repurchased a portion of the Series A Preferred Stock. See further discussion about the Series A Preferred Stock in note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

 Description of Business
Tripadvisor 
Tripadvisor operates a leading travel guidance platform, connecting a global audience of prospective travelers with travel partners through rich content, price comparison tools, and online reservation and related services for destinations, accommodations, travel activities and experiences, and restaurants. Tripadvisor’s mission is to help people around the world plan, book and experience the perfect trip.
In 2000, under its flagship brand, Tripadvisor, it launched www.Tripadvisor.com in the United States (“U.S.”). Since then, Tripadvisor has built a portfolio of travel guidance brands and businesses, seamlessly connecting travelers to 

I-3



destinations, accommodations, travel activities and experiences, and restaurants in over 40 markets and over 20 languages worldwide. 
Tripadvisor’s Industry and Market Opportunity
Tripadvisor operates in the global travel industry, focusing exclusively on online travel and travel-related activity, and the online advertising market. The global travel market (which excludes dining) is expected to reach $1.4 trillion of bookings in 2022, according to Phocuswright, an independent travel, tourism and hospitality research firm. 
As consumer travel media consumption and travel commerce activity has increasingly moved online, Tripadvisor believes travel and travel-related businesses will continue to allocate greater percentages of their marketing budgets to online channels in order to grow their businesses. Tripadvisor serves the needs of both the consumers and travel partners that operate within this market.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant negative impact on the travel, hospitality, restaurant, and leisure industries and consequently adversely and materially affected Tripadvisor’s business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Uncertainty continues over travel due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including how quickly global travel will recover and how the future travel experience will be changed and shaped by the pandemic. However, Tripadvisor believes that, while the pandemic could permanently change travel in certain ways, global travel will return to pre-pandemic levels. Consumers want to connect with others, learn about new places and see things they have not seen before. Tripadvisor believes this passion for travel combined with the need to make informed choices, creates significant long-term growth opportunities for its business.
Business Model
On a global scale, Tripadvisor matches consumer demand for travel with travel partners that offer accommodations, restaurants and other travel related experiences. Consumers come to the Tripadvisor platform directly via its branded site, www.tripadvisor.com, its mobile application (“app”), and through organic and paid search channels for those searching for information on accommodations, tours, activities, attractions and general visitor information for particular locations, and through sites included in its portfolio of brands. 
Value Proposition to Consumers
Tripadvisor helps consumers plan, book, and enjoy the trips that matter. Its platform offers consumers access to rich and expansive content, including more than 1 billion traveler reviews and other traveler-generated content such as photos, search and discovery capabilities across a variety of parameters such as location and price, and other informational content that helps drive consumer convenience as they plan and book their perfect trip. Tripadvisor believes this rich content has led Tripadvisor to become a trusted global brand, attracting nearly half a billion monthly unique visitors to its platform and influencing a significant amount of travel commerce during peak months prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tripadvisor is focused on creating the best online experience in travel planning and booking, making it easier for consumers to research destinations, experiences, and restaurants, read and contribute user-generated content (such as reviews and photos), compare destinations and businesses based on quality, price and availability comparisons, and complete bookings powered by its travel partners. 
Value Proposition to Travel Partners
The scale of Tripadvisor’s platform and the traffic to its platform enable its travel partners to be discovered, to advertise, and to sell their services to a global travel audience. These partners may include hotel chains, independent hoteliers, online travel agencies (“OTAs”), destination marketing organizations, and other travel-related and non-travel related product and service providers. Tripadvisor enables media advertising opportunities – and in some cases, facilitates transactions between consumers and travel partners in a number of ways, including by sending referrals to its travel partners’ websites, facilitating bookings on behalf of its travel partners, or by serving as the merchant of record – particularly in its Experiences offering – and by offering advertising placements on Tripadvisor’s platform.

Businesses and Products
Tripadvisor manages its business based on the following reportable segments: (1) Hotels, Media & Platform and (2) Experiences & Dining. 
The Hotels, Media & Platform segment includes revenue generated from the following sources:


● | Tripadvisor-branded Hotels Revenue. Tripadvisor’s largest source of Hotels, Media & Platform segment revenue is generated from click-based advertising on Tripadvisor-branded websites, which is primarily comprised of contextually-relevant booking links to its travel partners’ websites. Tripadvisor’s click-based travel partners are predominantly OTAs and hotels. Click-based advertising is generally priced on a cost-per-click, or CPC basis, with payments from travel partners determined by the number of travelers who click on a link multiplied by the CPC rate for each specific click. CPC rates are determined in a dynamic, competitive auction process, where its travel partner CPC bids for rates and availability to be listed on Tripadvisor’s platform are submitted.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tripadvisor also generates revenue from its cost-per-action, or “CPA” model, which consists of contextually-relevant booking links to its travel partners’ websites which are advertised on Tripadvisor’s platform. Tripadvisor earns a commission from its travel partners, based on a pre-determined contractual commission rate, for each traveler who clicks to and books a hotel reservation on the travel partners’ website, which results in a traveler stay. In addition, Tripadvisor also provides business-to-business (“B2B”) offerings, including subscription-based advertising to hotels, owners of B&Bs and other specialty lodging properties, enabling subscribers to advertise their businesses on Tripadvisor’s platform, as well as manage and promote their website URL, email address, phone number, special offers and other information related to their business. Subscription-based advertising services are predominantly sold for a flat fee for a contracted period of time. Tripadvisor also offers travel partners the opportunity to advertise and promote their business through hotel sponsored placements on its platform, generally on a CPC rate basis.


● | Tripadvisor-branded Display and Platform Revenue. Tripadvisor offers businesses the ability to promote their brands through display-based advertising placements on its platform across all of its segments and business units. Tripadvisor’s display-based advertising clients are predominantly direct suppliers of hotels, airlines and cruises, as well as destination marketing organizations. Tripadvisor also sells display-based advertising to OTAs and other travel-related businesses, as well as advertisers from non-travel categories. Display-based advertising is sold predominantly on a cost per thousand impressions basis.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Experiences & Dining segment includes revenue generated from the following sources: 


● | Experiences. Tripadvisor provides information and services that allow travelers to research and book tours, activities and attractions (the “experience”) in popular travel destinations in its Viator online marketplace. Tripadvisor also powers experience booking capabilities to travelers on third-party distribution partner websites and mobile apps, including the Tripadvisor platform, and some of the world’s top airlines, hotel chains, and online and offline travel agencies, including on the Tripadvisor websites and mobile apps. Tripadvisor works with local experience operators (the “operator”) to provide travelers the ability to book tours, activities and attractions in destinations worldwide. In these transactions, Tripadvisor acts as the merchant of record and generates commissions for each booking transaction it facilitates through its online reservation system. Tripadvisor also earns commissions from third-party merchant partners, who display and promote on their websites the experiences available on Tripadvisor’s platform to travelers which generate bookings, in transactions where Tripadvisor is not the merchant of record.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the vast majority of experience bookings, Tripadvisor collects the full amount charged to the traveler at the time of booking and remits the operator’s portion after the booked experience occurs, which contributes to positive working capital before the traveler completes the experience.

I-5



​

● | Dining. Tripadvisor provides information and services for consumers to research and book restaurant reservations in popular travel destinations through its dedicated online restaurant reservations offering, TheFork, and on its Tripadvisor-branded websites and mobile apps. Tripadvisor primarily generates transaction fees (or per seated diner fees) that are paid by its restaurant customers for diners seated through TheFork’s online reservation system. Tripadvisor also offers B2B services and generates subscription fees for subscription-based advertising to restaurants, access to certain online reservation management services, marketing analytic tools and menu syndication services provided by TheFork and Tripadvisor. In addition, Tripadvisor also offers restaurant partners the opportunity to advertise and promote their business through restaurant media advertising placements on its websites and mobile apps, generally on a CPC rate basis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Included in Corporate and other are Tripadvisor’s Rentals, Flights & Car and Cruise offerings. Corporate and other includes revenue generated from the following sources: 


● | Tripadvisor’s Rentals offering provides information and services that allow travelers to research and book vacation and short-term rental properties, including full homes, condominiums, villas, beach properties, cabins and cottages. Rentals primarily generates revenue, a commission from both the traveler and the property owner, by offering individual property owners and property managers the ability to list their rental properties on Tripadvisor’s platform, thereby connecting with travelers primarily through a free-to-list commission-based option. Tripadvisor generally collects payments from the traveler at the time of the booking, representing the amount due to the property owner or manager, as well as its commission. These properties are listed on www.flipkey.com, www.holidaylettings.co.uk, www.housetrip.com, www.niumba.com, www.vacationhomerentals.com, and on Tripadvisor-branded websites and mobile apps. In addition, Tripadvisor generates revenue from Flights, Cruises, and Car offerings on Tripadvisor’s platform, which primarily consist of click-based advertising and display-based advertising revenue, similar to the Hotels, Media & Platform segment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For further information regarding TripCo’s operating segments, refer to note 15 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Commercial Relationships 
Tripadvisor has commercial relationships with a majority of the world’s leading OTAs, as well as thousands of other travel partners, pursuant to which these companies primarily purchase traveler leads from Tripadvisor, generally on a click-based advertising basis. Although these relationships are memorialized in agreements, many of these agreements are for limited terms or are terminable at will or on short notice. As a result, Tripadvisor seeks to ensure the mutual success of these relationships.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, Tripadvisor’s two most significant travel partners were Expedia Group, Inc. (“Expedia”) and Booking Holdings Inc. (“Booking Holdings”), each of which accounted for 10% or more of Tripadvisor’s consolidated revenue and together accounted for approximately 34%, 25% and 33% of its consolidated revenue, respectively, with nearly all of this concentration of revenue recorded in the Tripadvisor-branded Hotels revenue line within the Hotels, Media & Platform segment for these reporting periods. Additionally, Tripadvisor’s business is dependent on relationships with third-party service operators that it relies on to fulfill service obligations to its customers where Tripadvisor is the merchant of record, such as Tripadvisor’s experience providers and vacation rental owners. However, no one operator’s inventory resulted in more than 10% of Tripadvisor’s revenue on a consolidated basis in any period presented.
Operations and Technology 
Tripadvisor has assembled a team of highly skilled software engineers, computer scientists, data scientists, network engineers and systems engineers whose expertise spans a broad range of technical areas, including a wide variety of open source operating systems, databases, languages, analytics, networking, scalable web architecture, operations and 

I-6



warehousing technologies. Tripadvisor makes significant investments in product and feature development, data management, personalization technologies, scalable infrastructures, networking, data warehousing, and search engine technologies. 
Tripadvisor’s systems infrastructure for Tripadvisor-branded websites is in a "hybrid-cloud" configuration in which parts of it are housed at a colocation facility and managed by Tripadvisor’s operations team, while the rest is hosted on Amazon Web Services. Tripadvisor’s infrastructure installations have multiple communication links as well as continuous monitoring and engineering support. The colocation facility is protected with both network-level and application-level defenses, using well known commercial solutions tailored for such purposes. Tripadvisor makes use of Amazon Web Services availability zones to provide redundancy for the cloud portions of its infrastructure. Substantially all of Tripadvisor’s software components, data, and content are replicated in multiple datacenters and development centers, as well as backed up at offsite locations. Tripadvisor’s systems are monitored and protected though multiple layers of security. Several of Tripadvisor’s individual subsidiaries and businesses have their own data infrastructure and technology teams.
Intellectual Property
Tripadvisor’s intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, proprietary technology and trade secrets, is an important component of its business. Tripadvisor relies on its intellectual property rights in its content, proprietary technology, software code, ratings indexes, databases of reviews and forum content. Tripadvisor has acquired some of its intellectual property rights through licenses and content agreements with third parties and these arrangements may place restrictions on its use of the intellectual property.
Tripadvisor protects its intellectual property by relying on its terms of use, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions, as well as on international, national, federal, state and common law rights. Tripadvisor protects its brands by pursuing the trademark registration of its core brands, as appropriate, maintaining its trademark portfolio, securing contractual trademark rights protection when appropriate, and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate. Tripadvisor also registers copyrights and domain names as deemed appropriate. Additionally, Tripadvisor protects its trademarks, domain names and copyrights with the use of intellectual property licenses and an enforcement program.
Tripadvisor has considered, and will continue to consider, the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions, as circumstances may warrant. However, many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by Tripadvisor.
In connection with Tripadvisor’s copyrightable content, it posts and institutes procedures under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act and similar “host privilege” statutes worldwide to gain immunity from copyright liability for photographs, text and other content loaded on its platform by consumers. However, differences between statutes, limitations on immunity, political and regulatory efforts to amend relevant statutes, and moderation efforts in the many jurisdictions in which Tripadvisor operates may affect its ability to claim immunity. 
From time to time, Tripadvisor may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of its business, including claims of alleged infringement by Tripadvisor of the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce Tripadvisor’s intellectual property rights, protect its trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any such litigation, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could materially harm Tripadvisor’s business. 
Seasonality
Consumers’ travel expenditures have historically followed a seasonal pattern. Correspondingly, travel partners’ advertising investments and therefore Tripadvisor’s revenue and operating profits, have also historically followed a seasonal pattern. Tripadvisor’s financial performance tends to be seasonally highest in the second and third quarters of a 

I-7



given year, which includes the seasonal peak in consumer demand, traveler hotel and rental stays, and travel activities and experiences taken, compared to the first and fourth quarters, which represent seasonal low points. During the first half of the year, experiences and rentals bookings typically exceed the amount of completed experiences and rental stays, resulting in higher cash flow related to working capital, while during the second half of the year, particularly in the third quarter, this pattern reverses and cash flows from these transactions are typically negative. 
However, as discussed in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in note 1 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements, other factors may also impact typical seasonal fluctuations, which include further significant shifts in Tripadvisor’s business mix or adverse economic conditions that could result in future seasonal patterns that are different from historical trends. For example, due to the impact of COVID-19 on Tripadvisor’s business, it did not experience its typical seasonal pattern for revenue and operating profits during the year ended December 31, 2020. COVID-19 contributed significantly to unfavorable working capital trends and material negative operating cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2020, most notably occurring during the first half of 2020 when Tripadvisor typically generates significant positive cash flow. 
Although consumer travel demand, traveler hotel and rental stays, and travel activities and experiences taken generally remain materially lower than historic levels, these trends improved during 2021, resulting in increased revenue, and working capital and operating cash flow more akin to typical historical seasonality trends. However, it is difficult to predict the seasonality for 2022, given the sustained uncertainty related to the continued economic and travel impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ultimate shape and timing of a recovery in Tripadvisor’s key markets. In addition, significant shifts in Tripadvisor’s business mix or adverse economic conditions could result in future seasonal patterns that are different from historical trends.
Terms of Investment in Tripadvisor
We own an approximate 21% economic interest and 57% voting interest in Tripadvisor as of December 31, 2021. Tripadvisor’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the holders of Tripadvisor common stock, acting as a single class, are entitled to elect a number of directors equal to 25% of the total number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, which is currently three directors. We consolidate Tripadvisor as we control a majority of the voting interest in Tripadvisor. We are subject to a Governance Agreement with Tripadvisor which provides us with certain director nomination, registration and other rights and imposes certain restrictions on our shares of Class B common stock. 
Regulatory Matters 
Tripadvisor is subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet as well as some relating to the travel industry, the vacation rental industry and the provision of travel services. As Tripadvisor continues to expand the reach of its brands into additional international markets and expands its product offerings, it is increasingly subject to additional laws and regulations. This includes laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection, libel and defamation, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, taxation, online payment services and competition, among others. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. Many of these laws and regulations are being tested in courts, and could be interpreted by regulators and courts in ways that could harm Tripadvisor’s business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations is often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which Tripadvisor operates. 
In addition, Tripadvisor provides advertising data and information and conducts marketing activities that are subject to consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices, domestically and internationally, including, in some countries, pricing display requirements, licensing and registration requirements and industry specific value-added tax regimes. The U.S. (as well as individual states), the European Union (the “E.U.”) (as well as member states) and other countries have adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the Internet, including online editorial and user-generated content, data privacy, behavioral targeting and online advertising, taxation, and liability for third-party activities. 

I-8



It is difficult to accurately predict how such legislation will be interpreted and applied or whether new taxes or regulations will be imposed on Tripadvisor’s services, and whether or how Tripadvisor might be affected. Increased regulation of the Internet could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise materially adversely affect Tripadvisor’s business, financial condition or operating results. 
Tripadvisor is subject to laws that require protection of user privacy and user data. As Tripadvisor’s business has evolved, Tripadvisor has begun to receive and store a greater volume of personally identifiable data. This data is increasingly subject to laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world. For example, the E.U., in May 2018, adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, which requires companies, including Tripadvisor, to meet enhanced requirements regarding the handling and storage of personal data. In addition, the State of California adopted the Consumer Privacy Protection Act which became effective January 1, 2020 and also enhances privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California. In addition, similar laws have been adopted or are currently under discussion in other jurisdictions. The enactment, interpretation and application of these laws is still in a state of flux. 
Also, on June 23, 2016, the U.K. passed a referendum to exit the E.U., known as Brexit, and the U.K. ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and E.U. finalized the terms of the departure. While there continues to be some uncertainty around U.K. and E.U. relations, Tripadvisor does not expect Brexit will have a material impact on its business and results of operations; however, it will likely face new regulations and additional hiring costs, as well as hiring limitations from candidates outside of the U.K.
Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on Tripadvisor’s business, results of operations and financial condition. However, certain laws and regulations have not historically been applied in the context of online travel companies, so there can be uncertainty regarding how these requirements may relate to Tripadvisor’s business in the future.
Marketing and Competition
Tripadvisor and its partners compete with other companies across numerous verticals within an attractive and rapidly evolving travel industry. In its daily operations, Tripadvisor competes to attract premier travel community-powered content (reviews, photos and other forms of engagement), traffic, advertising dollars, and, more generally, the purchasing power of high-intent and highly valuable consumers seeking to book vacations and spend. Since Tripadvisor’s travel review content and those of its competitors are typically free, Tripadvisor differentiates based on the awareness and trust travelers and diners place in its brand, the quality and nature of its consumer and B2B product offerings and through the choices available through its online travel search and price comparison services (or metasearch). As such, Tripadvisor invests in improving its consumer experience and expanding travel review content (the core offering within its value proposition), the growth of business listings on Tripadvisor’s platform that provides choice and the diverse range of bookable experiences it provides travelers during their vacations that create lasting memories. Knowing trust in Tripadvisor’s platform is paramount to its success and the virtues of its network effect, Tripadvisor also invests in leading the internet industry in its trust and safety initiatives, including providing transparency into its traveler review process and its efforts to combat misinformation and false reviews.
Tripadvisor also invests to amplify its global brand and raise consumer awareness of, and engagement with, its end-to-end product offerings. With hundreds of millions of visitors to its platform each year, Tripadvisor leverages a number of cost effective online and offline marketing channels to reach travelers and diners, including its own platform channels (i.e. websites and app), online search engines (primarily Google), social media, email, media via public relations, partnerships, and content distribution. The relative success of Tripadvisor’s marketing strategy is measurable on these channels and can be influenced by changes that Tripadvisor and its travel partners and competitors make to its respective products and marketing strategies. Tripadvisor allocates resources among the different marketing channels based on its internal return on investment measures. Tripadvisor competes globally with both online and offline, established and emerging, providers of travel, hospitality, lodging, experiences (bookable tours, activities, and attractions), and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services Tripadvisor offers are intensely competitive, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost.
