Our Company
 
Overview
 
Second Sight Medical Products, Inc. (“Second Sight,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar terms) has developed, manufactured and marketed implantable visual prosthetics that are intended to deliver useful artificial vision to blind individuals. We are a recognized global leader in neuromodulation devices for blindness, and are committed to developing new technologies to treat the broadest population of sight-impaired individuals.
 
Leveraging our 20 years of experience in neuromodulation for vision, we are developing the Orion® Visual Cortical Prosthesis System (“Orion”), an implanted cortical stimulation device intended to provide useful artificial vision to individuals who are blind due to a wide range of causes, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, optic nerve injury or disease and eye injury. Orion is intended to convert images captured by a miniature video camera mounted on glasses into a series of small electrical pulses. The device is designed to bypass diseased or injured eye anatomy and to transmit these electrical pulses wirelessly to an array of electrodes implanted on the surface of the brain’s visual cortex, where it is intended to provide the perception of patterns of light. We are conducting a six-subject Early Feasibility Study of the Orion device at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles (“UCLA”) and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston (“Baylor”). Regularly scheduled visits at both sites were paused in mid-March 2020 due to the coronavirus outbreak, however visits at UCLA resumed mid-September 2020 and Baylor resumed in December 2020. Our 36 month results, all of which were measured after the study resumed, indicate to us that:
 

● | We have a good safety profile. Five subjects experienced a total of fourteen adverse events (AEs) related to the device or to the surgery, through February 2022. One was considered a serious adverse event (SAE), and all of the adverse events were in the expected category. The one SAE occurred at about three months post-implant, was resolved quickly, and did not require a hospital stay. There have been no serious adverse events due to the device or surgery since June 2018.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The efficacy data is encouraging. We measure efficacy by looking at three measures of visual function: The first is square localization, where Orion subjects sit in front of a touch screen and are asked to touch within the boundaries of a square when it appears. The second is direction of motion, where subjects are asked to identify the direction and motion of lines on a screen. The third is grating visual acuity, a measure of visual acuity that is adapted for very low vision. Five subjects have completed these tests at 36-months. For these 36-month results, on square localization, five of five subjects tested in our feasibility study performed significantly better with the system on than off. On direction of motion, five of five performed better with the system on than off. On grating visual acuity, two of five tested had measurable visual acuity on the scale of this test (versus none who can do it with the device off). Another efficacy measurement of day-to-day functionality and benefit is FLORA, an acronym for Functional Low-Vision Observer Rated Assessment. FLORA is an assessment performed by an independent, third-party low vision orientation and mobility specialist who spends time with each of the subjects in their homes. The specialist asks each of the subjects a series of questions and also observes them performing 15 or more daily living tasks, such as finding light sources, following a sidewalk, or sorting laundry. The specialist then determines if the system is providing a benefit, if it is neutral, or if it is actually hurting the abilities of subjects to perform these tasks. FLORA results to date show that 4 out of 4 completing the FLORA at 36 months had positive or mild positive results indicating the Orion system is providing benefit. We reached agreement with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2019 to utilize a revised version of FLORA as our primary efficacy endpoint in our pivotal trial for Orion, pending successful validation of the instrument.

No peer-reviewed data is available yet for the Orion system. We are currently negotiating the clinical and regulatory pathway to commercialization with the FDA as part of the Breakthrough Devices Program.
 
Product and Clinical Development Plans
 
By further developing our visual cortical prosthesis, Orion, we believe we may be able to significantly expand our market to include nearly all profoundly blind individuals. The principal notable exceptions for potential use of the Orion are those who are blind due to otherwise currently treatable diseases, individuals who are born blind, or blindness due to direct damage of the visual cortex, which is rare. However, of the estimated 36 million blind people worldwide, there are approximately 5.8 million people who are legally blind due to causes that are not otherwise treatable. We continue to develop and refine our estimates of the potential addressable market size as we evaluate the commercial prospects for Orion using a combination of published sources, third party market research, and physician feedback. We currently estimate over 500,000 individuals in the US are legally blind due to retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, optic nerve disease and eye injury. Of this population, we estimate the potential US addressable market is between 50,000 and 100,000 individuals with bi-lateral blindness at the light-perception level or worse. Our marketing approvals by the FDA and other regulatory agencies will ultimately determine the subset of these patients who are eligible for the Orion based on our clinical trials and the associated results.
 
Our objective in designing and developing the Orion visual prosthesis system is to bypass the optic nerve and directly stimulate the part of the brain responsible for human vision. A six-subject Early Feasibility Study of the Orion device is currently underway at UCLA and Baylor. Our 36 month results indicate a good safety profile with encouraging efficacy data and benefits in helping subjects perform their daily living tasks. We believe these data results are encouraging and support advancement of Orion into a larger pivotal clinical study. Early promising results are not necessarily indicative of results which may be obtained in our larger Orion clinical trials.
 
In November 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Devices Program designation for the Orion. This designation is given to a few select medical devices in order to provide more effective treatment of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions. This program is intended to help patients have more timely access to these medical devices by expediting their development, assessment, and review.
 
On February 26, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Argus 2s Retinal Prosthesis System, a redesigned set of external hardware (glasses and video processing unit) initially for use in combination with previously implanted Argus II systems for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The Company expects that the Argus 2s will be adapted to be the external system for the next generation Orion Visual Cortical Prosthesis System currently under development. In addition to ergonomic improvements, the Argus 2s system offers significantly more processing power, potentially allowing for improved video processing.
 
Our principal offices are located in Los Angeles, California.
 
Our first commercially approved product, the Argus® II Retinal Prosthesis System (“Argus II”), treats outer retinal degenerations, such as retinitis pigmentosa, also referred to as RP. The Argus II was the only retinal prosthesis approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), and was the first approved retinal prosthesis in the world. RP is a hereditary disease, affecting an estimated 1.5 million people worldwide including about 100,000 people in the United States, that causes a progressive degeneration of the light-sensitive cells of the retina, leading to significant visual impairment and ultimately blindness. A subset of these patients would be eligible for the Argus II since the approved baseline vision for the Argus II is worse than legally blind (20/200). We commissioned 3rd party market research to estimate the size of the RP market that resulted in an estimate of approximately 1,500 patients in the US with advanced RP that could be treated with the Argus II given the eligibility criteria of our label.

We began selling the Argus II System in Europe at the end of 2011, Saudi Arabia in 2012, the United States and Canada in 2014, Turkey in 2015, Iran, Taiwan, South Korea and Russia in 2017, and Singapore in 2018. Given the limited addressable market of Argus II, we no longer market the Argus II and have focused all of our resources on the development of Orion.
 
We are also researching multiple technologies that we believe to be complimentary to artificial vision and could potentially provide significant enhancements to the Orion user experience. In most cases, we collaborate with 3rd party firms to advance and integrate these innovative technologies with our artificial vision systems. Examples of technologies that we believe will be complimentary to our products include: eye tracking, object recognition and localization, thermal imaging and depth-based decluttering.
 
In early March 2020, we commenced clinical validation activities for the FLORA-20 instrument, the primary efficacy endpoint we have selected for our future pivotal clinical trial of Orion. In mid-March 2020, our validation activities were suspended as a result of public health concerns and related social distancing due to COVID-19. We are in the process of evaluating when activities related to the validation study can be resumed.
 
In May 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 7,500,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $1.00 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $7.5 million, and net proceeds of approximately $6.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses.
 
In May 2020, we entered into a Letter Agreement with Sylmar Biomedical Park, LLC (the “Landlord”) to terminate our facility leases in which we agreed to vacate the premises by June 18, 2020 and pay $210,730 to bring our leases current and pay a one-time early termination fee of $150,000. Prior to the early termination, we were obligated to pay aggregate base rent of approximately $0.9 million and common area maintenance expenses for the respective remaining terms of our leases in February 2022 and April 2023.
 
We completed our offer to rescind certain purchases of shares under our ESPP plan on May 27, 2020. We voluntarily offered to rescind the sale of shares of our common stock to employees who purchased those shares under the ESPP and to reimburse any losses upon the sale of our shares of our common stock for certain purchase periods because these shares may not have been exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The rescission of these share purchases resulted in the repurchase and cancelation of 39,467 shares of our common stock. The total cost for the repurchase of these shares and the reimbursement of any losses from the sale of such shares totaled approximately $270,000.

In June 2020, we commenced a process to dissolve our Swiss subsidiary which is still in process.
 
On December 8, 2020, we borrowed $1 million from Gregg Williams, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company and $1.2 million from two unaffiliated shareholders. Each promissory note was unsecured and accrued interest at a rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum beginning on receipt of the loan amounts. We repaid the principal and accrued interest of $135,000 during the quarter ended June 30, 2021.
 
On January 22, 2021, we entered into a lease agreement, effective February 1, 2021, to sub-lease office space to replace our existing headquarters. We will pay $17,000 per month, increasing to $17,500 per month on February 1, 2022, plus operating expenses, to lease 17,290 square feet of office space at 13170 Telfair Avenue, Sylmar CA 91342. Additionally, we received full rent abatement for March 2021, and will receive half rent abatement for March 2022. The sub-lease is for two years and two months. We are not affiliates with, or related to, or otherwise have any other relationship with the other parties, other than the lease.
 
On March 23, 2021, we closed our private placement to seven institutional investors of 4,650,000 shares of common stock at a price of $6.00 per share for aggregate net proceeds of approximately $24.5 million.
 
On March 26, 2021, the Board of Directors appointed Scott Dunbar to replace Matthew Pfeffer, as acting Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Pfeffer resumed his role as a director at such date.
 
On June 25, 2021, we closed an underwritten public offering of 11,500,000 shares of common stock at a price of $5.00 per share for aggregate net proceeds of $53.3 million.
 
On February 4, 2022, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Nano Precision Medical, Inc., a California corporation, and, upon and subject to the execution of a joinder, NPM Acquisition Corp., a California corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the agreement and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, NPM will merge with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”), and upon consummation of the merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist and NPM will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Upon completion of the merger and subject to shareholder approval, the Company will change its name as agreed in the future and may change its trading symbol as NPM requests in writing following consultation with Nasdaq.

Our Technology
 
Orion works by converting video images captured by a miniature camera housed in a user’s glasses into a series of small electrical pulses that are transmitted wirelessly to an array of electrodes. The Orion array is implanted on the surface of the visual cortex of the brain, bypassing the eye and optic nerve and directly stimulating the region of the brain responsible for vision. The pulses generated are intended to create a perception of patterns of light in the brain. Following the implant surgery, users learn to interpret these visual patterns as artificial vision, allowing them to detect shapes of people and objects in their surroundings.
 
We believe Orion possesses several unique technological advancements compared to other neurostimulation devices, including a hermetic package with the smallest size and largest number of individually programmable electrodes, and a patented electrode material that allows for high charge densities and small electrode size. Several other engineering challenges, including device reliability, extended lifetime, and a safe and effective bio-interface, were overcome during the development of the products and these solutions have been protected both by patents and by trade secrets. Much of the technology developed for Argus II is also used in Orion. As of December 31, 2021, we have more than 300 issued patents and over 15 pending patent applications worldwide.
 
We have demonstrated the ability to design products with long-term reliability. The Argus I retinal prosthesis, a proof of concept device that was a predecessor to the Argus II, was implanted in six patients in the United States. Argus I patients were implanted an average of almost seven years, with one patient having used the device for over 10 years. The Argus II system has been implanted in over 350 patients. The average implant duration for these patients is nearly five years with several users continuing to use the system 10 years following implantation.
 
In November 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Devices Program designation for the Orion. This designation is given to a select number of medical devices in order to provide more effective treatment of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions. This program is intended to help patients have more timely access to these medical devices by expediting their development, assessment, and review. With this designation, we believe the Orion will have the following advantages during the FDA review process:
 

● | more interactive review both for the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) and Premarket Approval application;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | greater reliance on post-market data collection and greater acceptance of uncertainty in the benefit-risk profile at the time of approval;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | priority review (i.e., review of the submission is placed at the top of the review queue and receives additional review resources); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | senior FDA management involvement and assignment of a cross-disciplinary case manager.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We expect that inclusion in the Breakthrough Devices Program may shorten the timeline required to bring the Orion to market as a commercial product. We also are currently evaluating our pivotal trial design for Orion and hope to reach consensus with the FDA on design specifics. Major elements of our clinical trial design include the number of patients, study duration, and the endpoints suitable for assessing visual function, functional vision and quality of life. We have reached agreement with FDA on the primary effectiveness endpoint, pending validation of an assessment we have developed for the purpose. We are currently working with FDA on alignment on a primary safety endpoint and confirmation of a statistical sample size which will drive the number of subjects to be enrolled in the pivotal study. While negotiations with the FDA are ongoing, we believe the study design will require a minimum pre-market sample population of at least 45 subjects (plus additional post-market subjects) with at least 12 months of follow-up data for each patient prior to submittal of a premarket approval (PMA) application.
 
Our Markets
 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO)1, 253 million people suffer from moderate to severe vision impairment worldwide. Of these, 36 million people are considered legally blind. The WHO further estimates that 80% of legal blindness is avoidable, leaving 7.8 million legally blind individuals. We continue to develop and refine our estimates of the potential addressable market size as we evaluate the commercial prospects for Orion using a combination of published sources, third-party market research, and physician feedback.

In the U.S., 1.3 million people are legally blind3. We commissioned third-party market research for the potential market for Orion and we currently estimate over 500,000 individuals in the U.S. are legally blind. Of this population, we estimate the potential U.S. addressable market is between 50,000 and 100,000 individuals with bi-lateral blindness at the light-perception level or worse. Our marketing approvals by the FDA and other regulatory agencies will ultimately determine the subset of these patients who are eligible for the Orion based on our clinical trials and the associated results.
 
Many other diseases can also cause blindness. Many of the largest causes of visual impairment (i.e. refractive error and cataracts) are avoidable or curable, and their prolonged or untreated impact on vision is largely observed in developing nations and are not part of our target market. Some other causes of blindness, such as brain trauma to the visual cortex, may also not be suitable for treatment by a cortical stimulator. However, the remaining causes of severe vision loss which include glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, eye trauma, optic nerve disease or injury and many others can result in severe visual impairment that could potentially be treatable by an Orion visual prosthesis system.
 
We believe that, if approved by the FDA, the Orion will initially treat a subset of these legally blind individuals, likely starting with the ones who are completely blind. If this is the case, we anticipate that if we are further able to collect additional clinical data demonstrating the efficacy of the Orion for patients with better vision, we will be able to expand the approved indications and addressable market of the Orion to include a larger subset of these 5.8 million individuals for whom no effective treatment currently exists.
 
By further developing our visual cortical prosthesis, Orion, we believe we will significantly expand our market to include nearly all profoundly blind individuals. The only notable exceptions for potential use of the Orion are those who are blind due to otherwise currently treatable diseases, individuals who are born blind, or blindness due to direct damage of the visual cortex, which is rare.

Our Strategy
 
Our strategy can be summarized as follows:
 

● | Leverage proven Argus technology to develop the Orion visual cortical prosthesis and significantly expand our addressable market to include a portion of the almost 6 million patients who are blind from eye trauma, optic nerve disease and injury, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and other untreatable causes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Invest in research and development of technologies intended to enhance the Orion user experience, including eye tracking, distance filtering/decluttering, object and facial recognition and thermal imaging.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to provide limited product support for Argus II patients while expanding our overall investment in Orion.

Global Reimbursement
 
Obtaining reimbursement from governmental and private insurance companies is critical to our commercial success. Due to the price of the Orion system, our future sales would be limited without the availability of third-party reimbursement. In the U.S., coding, coverage, and payment are necessary for the surgical procedure and Orion system to be reimbursed by payors. Coding will need to be established for the device and the surgical procedure. Coverage and payment vary by payor. The majority of Argus II patients were eligible for Medicare, and coverage was primarily provided through traditional Medicare, sometimes referred to as Medicare Fee-for-Service (“FFS”) or Medicare Advantage. A small percentage of patients were covered by commercial insurers.

● | Medicare FFS patients – Coverage is determined by Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) that administer various geographic regions of the U.S.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Medicare Advantage patients – Medicare Advantage plans are required to cover the same benefits as those covered by the MAC in that jurisdiction. For example, if a MAC in a jurisdiction has favorable coverage for Orion, then typically Medicare Advantage plans in that MAC jurisdiction offer the same coverage. Individual hospitals and ASCs may negotiate contracts specific to that individual facility. In addition, procedural payment is variable and can be based on a percentage of billed charges, payment groupings or other individually negotiated payment methodologies. Medicare Advantage plans also allow providers to confirm coverage and payment for the procedure in advance of implantation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Commercial insurer patients – Commercial insurance plans make coverage and payment rate decisions independent of Medicare, and contracts are individually negotiated with facility and physician providers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Currently, we are in the process of evaluating potential reimbursement pathways for Orion in the U.S. market. Compared to Argus II, which was largely catering to the Medicare patient population, Orion is expected to address a patient population with a more diverse and balanced payor mix due to our potential indications profile and expected younger patient population, on average. As Orion is a part of the FDA’s Breakthrough Devices program, we are closely evaluating a variety of fast-track reimbursement programs, including recent encouraging announcements from CMS proposing modernization of payment policies for medical devices that meet FDA’s Breakthrough Devices designation. We have also approached some commercial payors and CMS to get their feedback to ensure our overall reimbursement strategy for Orion therapy will cater to their key data requirements.
 
Market Development Plans
 
Orion. By further developing our visual cortical prosthesis, Orion, we believe we may be able to significantly expand our market to include nearly all profoundly blind individuals. The only notable exceptions for potential use of the Orion are those who are blind due to otherwise currently treatable diseases, individuals who are born blind, or blindness due to direct damage of the visual cortex, which is rare. However, of the estimated 36 million blind people worldwide, there are approximately 5.8 million people who are legally blind due to causes that are not otherwise treatable. We continue to develop and refine our estimates of the potential addressable market size as we evaluate the commercial prospects for Orion using a combination of published sources, third party market research, and physician feedback. We currently estimate over 500,000 individuals in the US are legally blind due to retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, optic nerve disease and eye injury. Of this population, we estimate the potential US addressable market is between 50,000 and 100,000 individuals with bi-lateral blindness at the light-perception level or worse. Our marketing approvals by the FDA and other regulatory agencies will ultimately determine the subset of these patients who are eligible for the Orion based on our clinical trials and the associated results.
 
Our objective in designing and developing the Orion visual prosthesis system is to bypass the optic nerve and directly stimulate the part of the brain responsible for human vision. A six-subject Early Feasibility Study of the Orion device is currently underway at UCLA and Baylor. Regularly scheduled visits at both sites were placed on hold in mid-March due to Covid-19, however visits at UCLA resumed mid-September 2020 and Baylor resumed in December 2020. Our 36 month results for the six subjects indicate a good safety profile with encouraging efficacy data and benefits in helping subjects perform their daily living tasks. We believe these data are encouraging and support advancement of Orion into a larger pivotal clinical study. Early promising results are not necessarily indicative of results which may be obtained in large clinical trials. No assurance can be given that we will achieve similar results in our larger Orion clinical trials. No peer-reviewed data is available yet for the Orion system.

COVID-19 Pandemic
 
In accordance with local and state guidelines regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, we are requiring all of our employees to wear masks in the office and use their best judgement to work remotely or work in the office. While many of our employees are accustomed to working remotely, much of our workforce has not historically been remote. Although we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance becomes available, restricting the ability to do business in person may create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
In addition, our clinical trials have been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Patient visits in ongoing clinical trials were delayed, for example, due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 outbreak, travel restrictions imposed by governments, and the inability to access sites for initiation and monitoring. Also, some of our suppliers of certain materials used in the development of our product candidates are located in areas impacted by COVID-19 which could limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for our product candidates. COVID-19 has and will continue to adversely affect global economies and financial markets, and may result in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our product candidates, if approved, and impact our operating results. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of the continued global economic impact of the pandemic. We cannot anticipate all of the ways in which health epidemics such as COVID-19 could adversely impact our business. Although we are continuing to monitor and assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. See the Risk Factors section for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.

Commercial efforts to develop retinal implants by others include:
 

● | Pixium: A publicly held French company that is developing the PRIMA (sub-retinal implant) for Dry-AMD patients. In 2017, Pixium announced approval for two feasibility studies of PRIMA in Dry-AMD patients. One study reportedly is in Paris with five subjects, and a second Early Feasibility Study in the U.S. of five patients is underway at two sites – Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Miami, Florida. To date, Pixium has announced the successful implantation and activation of five devices in Paris and two devices in the U.S. with limited performance data reported.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | NanoRetina Inc., a company based in Israel, and several other early stage companies are reported to have developed intellectual property or technology that may improve retinal prostheses in the future. A clinical trial is underway in Europe and an unknown number of patients have been implanted.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Academic entities are also working on vision restoring implants. These include Bionic Vision Australia (an early prototype device has been developed and to our knowledge implanted in three human subjects), Boston Retinal Implant project (preclinical phase), Monash Vision Group (preclinical phase), and the Illinois Institute of Technology (clinical phase). Of these projects, we believe most have not yet demonstrated a working implant, only one has reportedly begun long-term clinical work in humans, and to our knowledge only the Illinois Institute of Technology has received FDA approval to begin clinical trials in the U.S.

Our Competition
 
The U.S. life sciences industry is highly competitive. The treatment of blindness is a significant clinically unmet need and others continue to make progress. There are several approaches to treating blindness including  other visual prostheses and non-electrical stimulation treatments. Visual prosthesis approach include:

● | Retinal Prostheses: The retina is the first nerve tissue in the visual network that generates electrical signals. A retinal prosthesis implant stimulates the retina with electrodes. We are aware of three primary approaches to this: 1) Subretinal Prosthesis, which is placed beneath the retina and between the retina and choroid, 2) Epiretinal Prosthesis, which is placed on the surface of the retina, and 3) Suprachoridal prosthesis, which is placed outside the choroid (behind the eye). Active retinal prosthesis companies and research groups include: ● Pixium Vision: A publicly held French company that is developing the PRIMA (sub-retinal implant) for Dry-AMD patients. In 2017, Pixium announced approval for two feasibility studies of PRIMA in Dry-AMD patients. One study reportedly was in Paris with five subjects, and a second Early Feasibility Study in the U.S. of five patients is underway at two sites – Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Miami, Florida. A pivotal study of PRIMA is underway in Europe (France, Germany, and UK) with read-out of results expected in 2023. However, no plans for a pivotal study in the US have been announced. ● The Boston Retinal Implant project is developing a subretinal prosthesis system, but has not advanced to clinical trials. ● Nano Retina Inc., a company based in Israel, and several other early stage companies are reported to have developed intellectual property or technology that may improve retinal prostheses in the future. A Nano Retina clinical trial is underway in Europe and Israel, and 5 subjects reportedly have been implanted to date. ● Bionic Vision Technologies, based in Australia, was recently granted Breakthrough Device status for its Bionic Eye Visual Prosthesis System, a suprachoroidal device. The company has completed a two-year feasibility study and has partnered with Cirtec Medical in the US. It is in the planning stages for a global pivotal study.

● | Optic Nerve Implant: Moving down the visual network path, some are developing a cuff electrode array that is placed around the optic nerve just behind the eye. We believe these are in early research phase. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Visual Cortical Prosthesis: To our knowledge, we are the only commercially focused organization developing a visual cortical prosthesis (Orion), which is placed beneath the skull and on the surface of the visual cortex. A few other groups worldwide are developing an intracortical visual prosthesis with electrodes that penetrate the brain, including:. ● Illinois Institute of Technology’s Intracortical Visual Prosthesis (ICVP), a system of wireless, penetrating electrode arrays, has been designated a Breakthrough Device and has advanced to early feasibility study in the US. One subject of 5 has been implanted. ● Monash Vision Group’s Gennaris system is also composed of wireless penetrating arrays. To our knowledge, this project is still in a preclinical phase. ● Neuralink is developing a brain implant with penetrating electrodes that it has demonstrated in animal models. Vision restoration is one of Neuralink’s many stated goals.

As we continue to demonstrate the potential benefits and safety profile of Orion, we may face competition from other entities seeking to develop a visual cortical prosthesis. While we are currently precluded by the exclusion criteria in our Early Feasibility Study from testing Orion in any indication where a current therapeutic option exists, such as with RP using Argus, we or others may ultimately seek to demonstrate the potential benefits and safety profile of a visual cortical prosthesis for RP.

Other approaches not involving electrical stimulation include:
 

● | Transplants: transplanting retinal tissue to stimulate remaining retinal cells. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stem Cells: generally, involves implanting immature retinal support cells aimed at slowing retinal degeneration. A single patient in London, England with wet AMD was reportedly implanted in 2015 with an embryonic stem cell line in a study sponsored by Pfizer. This study has been suspended. Patients with dry AMD were recruited in several countries (US, UK, and South Korea) for similar small studies. Data from these early-stage studies are encouraging with regard to safety and potential therapeutic benefit, but these have been described as Phase ½ clinical trials, with the likely next step of ongoing in vitro cell optimization and small clinical validation studies prior to larger pivotal studies . A few other study groups are investigating different human embryonic stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell lines for retinal diseases, but to our knowledge, they are all in early stages.

● | Genetics and Gene Therapy: involves identifying a specific gene that is causing retinal problems (there are over 120 for retinitis pigmentosa alone) resulting in visual impairments and blindness and inserting healthy genes into an individual’s cells using a virus as a delivery mechanism to treat the diseases. A company (Spark Therapeutics) completed a phase 3 study in 21 patients with a median age of 11 for a gene that affects a very small percentage of retinitis pigmentosa patients, RPE65. That company applied for and received FDA approval for Luxturna in 2018. Pricing for these injections is reported to be approximately $850,000 for both eyes. We believe that there is virtually no overlap with our current market since our patients generally are adults (Orion was studied in adults 22-74 years old). Luxturna also treats better sighted patients since it is aimed at improving or preserving residual vision. In contrast, Orion seeks to create artificial vision where vision is completely lost.

● | Optogenetics Therapy: aimed at slowing down, reversing, and/or eliminating the process by which photoreceptors in the eye are compromised. This therapy requires using the patient’s cells with a virus as a delivery mechanism intended to cause cells within the eye to become light sensitive. Animal work has shown that these cells are not sensitive enough to respond to ambient light, so this approach currently also requires a light amplifier outside the body to increase light delivered to the retina. Several phase 1/2a and 2b/3 trials of optogenetic treatments for RP or related diseases are active in the US, but none of these treatments have been approved for marketing in any markets, to our knowledge.

● | Nutritional Therapy: involves diets or supplements that are thought to prevent or slow the progress of vision loss. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Implantable Telescope: VisionCare Ophthalmic Technologies, Inc. offers an FDA approved implantable miniature telescope for AMD, a magnifying device that is implanted in the eye. The VisionCare telescope is approved for use in patients with severe to profound vision impairment (best corrected visual acuity of 20/160 to 20/800) due to dry AMD. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Wicab’s The BrainPort® V100 includes a video camera mounted on a pair of sunglasses, a hand-held controller, and tongue array. The tongue array contains 400 electrodes and is connected to the glasses via a flexible cable. White pixels from the camera are felt on the tongue as strong stimulation, black pixels as no stimulation, and gray levels as medium levels of stimulation. This device is indicated for the profoundly blind.

● | There are currently no known treatments for dry AMD after the disease has caused severe to profound vision loss nor are there any established treatments that delay or reverse the progression of dry AMD other than supplements. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Therapies exist for Wet AMD that delay the progression of visual impairment or slightly improve the vision, rather than completely curing or reversing its course. These therapies are approved in many regions throughout the world, including the U.S. and European Union (“EU”).

Warranty
 
We generally provide a standard limited warranty for the Argus II system covering replacement over the following periods after implant:
 

● | three years on implanted epiretinal prosthesis
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | two years on wearable components other than batteries and chargers
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | three months on batteries and chargers
--+---------------------------------------

 
Based on our experience to date, the Argus II system has proven to be a reliable device generally performing as intended. We have accrued warranty expense of $50,000 as of December 31, 2021, which is based upon our historical experience rate.
 
Our Research Development and Quality Assurance
 
We have a single facility, located at our principal office in Los Angeles, California.
 
We rely on many suppliers to provide the materials and services necessary to produce and test our products. Many of these materials or services are currently provided by sole source suppliers. In a number of instances we maintain sole source suppliers because our current purchasing volumes do not warrant developing more than one supplier. We expect to secure additional providers as our production volumes increase. If we experience a loss of a sole supplier before confirming an alternative, we risk possible disruptions in our operations. We attempt to mitigate the sole source risk by, among other things, increasing parts inventory as a partial hedge against interruptions in parts supply and by actively seeking to develop alternative supplier sources before experiencing any such disruptions.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 15 employees, including 10 in clinical, regulatory and research and development; and 5 in administration. Of these persons, all are employed in the United States. We believe that the continued success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and we are committed to developing our people and providing them with opportunities to contribute to our growth and success. None of these employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good to excellent.
Properties
 
Our principal office and facilities are located at 13170 Telfair Avenue, Sylmar CA 91342, which consists of approximately 17,290 rentable square feet at a current base rent of about $17,000 per month. Our sub-lease expires in March 2023. We believe that these premises are adequate for our foreseeable needs.
