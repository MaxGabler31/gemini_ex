Our Company History
 
Eco Building Products, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the state of Colorado under the name N8 Concepts, Inc. on March 27, 2007.
 
On October 19, 2009, the Company merged with Ecoblu Products, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (“ECOBLU”). For financial reporting purposes, the acquisition was treated as a reverse acquisition whereby ECOBLU’s operations continued to be reported as if it had actually been the acquirer.
 
ECOBLU was organized May 20, 2009 in Nevada as a wholesale distributor and manufacturer of proprietary wood products coated with an eco-friendly chemistry designed to protect against mold, rot, decay, termites and fire. The Company had also developed a customer coating program that allows lumber companies to coat commodity lumber at their facilities contingent upon their stocking the Company’s inventory and supporting the Company’s products.
 
On April 8, 2011, the Company formed Red Shield Lumber, Inc. (“Red Shield”) in British Columbia, Canada. Red Shield was formed for the purpose of opening a plant in Canada utilizing the Company’s coating process to support sales and distribution. As of June 30, 2017, the wholly owned subsidiary has no operating activity and we do not expect this subsidiary to begin operations in the near future.
 
On May 31, 2011, the Company formed E Build & Truss, Inc. (“E Build”) in the State of California. E Build was formed for the purpose of operating the Company’s framing labor and truss manufacturing activities. This wholly-owned subsidiary commenced operations during the three months ended December 31, 2011. The assets of this Company were sold in May 2015 pursuant to a Limited Assets Purchase Agreement with Stone Truss, LLC, a California corporation, dated April 15, 2015. Pursuant to the terms of the Limited Assets Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to sell certain assets owned by E Build for total consideration of $100,000. The buyer was a former employee of Eco Building Products, Inc. Eco owed this employee $40,255 in outstanding accounts payable reimbursements and $71,847 in payroll related expenses that the employee paid for Eco Building Products, Inc. The total amount owed was $112,102. The employee paid these expenses to keep his facility operational and to make sure workers were paid. In order to repay the employee for the described cash outlays, Eco and the employee agreed to an asset purchase of E Build & Truss of $100,000. After some discussion, Eco and the employee came to an agreement to offset what Eco owed the employee ($112,012) against the asset purchase. The employee agreed to take the assets as payment in full. As a result of this agreement, the debt was reduced to $12,102 and subsequently satisfied.
 
In January of 2016, Management began implementing a new business model and strategy, transforming Eco from a treated wood products supplier to a developer and manufacturer of cutting edge, environmentally friendly wood preservation chemistry and technology closing treating operations in N.J., GA and WA. The Company did not have any contingent liabilities arising from closing of its facilities as of June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016.
 
On December 16, 2016, the Company formed the subsidiary, Wood Protection Technologies, Inc., (WPT) in the State of Nevada.

Products
 
Eco Building Products, Inc., or “ECOB”, has developed a line of eco-friendly protective wood coatings, Eco Red Shield TM and Eco Clear Shield TM, that extend the lifecycle of framing lumber and other wood products used in the construction of single-family homes and multi-story buildings. The Company has changed its’ product offering breaking up the wood treatment into three different categories to include Eco Red Shield Sill Plate (SP), Eco Red Shield Advanced Framing Lumber (AFL) and Eco Red Shield Fire Treated (FT). These newly created categories allow the customer to choose the level of protection at fair market prices and allows the Company to make significantly better margins on each product. Additionally, the Company has advanced the development and implementation of the Eco D-Fence product line.
 
Eco Building Products wood coatings are topically applied to a wide range of lumber products providing protection from mold, mildew, fungus, decay, wood rot, wood ingesting insects, including Formosan termites. Eco Red Shield™ (AFL & FT) also serves as a fire inhibitor; significantly increasing treated lumber’s resistance to fire, by way of decreasing the smoke (fire gases) index, slowing ignition time and flame spread.
 
The ECOB system of coatings is eco-friendly and remains chemically stable over time. The coatings emit virtually zero volatile organic compounds (VOCs), do not leech heavy metals or toxins into groundwater, and do not allow for the growth and propagation of various molds on the cured film surface, that have the potential to contaminate occupant indoor air quality. More importantly, ECOB coatings prevent the degradation of structural lumber that potentially requires existing homes to be periodically renovated resultant of rot and/or insect damage, thereby indirectly preserving our forests.

Eco D-Fence TM
 
Eco D-Fence represents your first line of defense against nature’s fury. Developed using Eco Red Shield WoodSurfaceFilmtm technology at the core. Eco D-Fence product line offers all of the protection of mold, mildew, fungus, decay, rot, termites (and other wood boring insects including Formosan termites) with optional fire inhibitor coupled with traditional features of exterior stain. For a similar cost of typical fence stain, now you can get value added protection that is environmentally friendly. The optional fire inhibitor extends the protection to create a fire break around the perimeter of your property. Currently this product is being sold to customers for factory application.
 
Markets
 
In January of 2016 Management took steps to narrow its focus to chemical product development, manufacturing and sale, effectively re-engineering its entire business model and closing its treating operations. While Eco’s chemistry can be applied to many diverse materials. Currently, it has purposefully limited its attention to the various wood preservation markets. The Company views its current targeted market opportunity in two large sectors: 1) the overall softwood lumber market for which there has been no cost effective protection chemistry or technology heretofore and 2) the traditional wood preservation market. We believe Eco Building Products is uniquely positioned to disrupt both sectors.
 
Eco Building Products chemistry can be applied to any wood substrate where the end-user desires protection against the risks associated with mold, wood rot, termites and fire and hence the market opportunity is extremely large.
 
Total U.S. lumber consumption is projected to rise strongly, moving from 44.1 billion board feet in 2015 (nominal, or 70.8 million m3 net) to 47.1 billion bf in 2016 and to almost 50 billion bf in 2017. – According to the Wood Business 2016 Lumber Outlook report.
 
The Company recognizes the magnitude of the overall opportunity but has limited its focus to fencing and wood frame construction used in new single and multi-family residential; light commercial construction as well as renovation through multiple channels including wholesale distribution, pro-lumber dealers, large lumber traders and home centers. The Company sells these channels through licensed Customers that buy and apply its chemistry on a regional and OEM basis.
 
Eco Red Shield™ can be factory applied to all wood substrates for the entire super-structure prior to construction, preserving the wood’s structural integrity, while only adding an estimated 10% to 30% to the cost of building materials.
 
The Company understands that the traditional wood preservation and or treating industry currently comprise approximately six to eight percent of the overall lumber industry. Traditional wood preservation is performed in a cylinder under pressure or vacuum process. Its limited market penetration is due in large part to the cost of this process and that it fundamentally degrades the strength of wood fiber while potentially employing hazardous chemicals. Eco Red Shield is topically applied, employs no heavy metals, 2B carcinogens, heavy aldehydes or solvents and does not degrade the strength of wood fiber.
 
The Company has obtained Technical Evaluation Reports (TERs) from DrJ Engineering certifying that its core products Eco FT™ (Fire Treated), Eco Red Shield AFL ™ (Advanced Framing Lumber) and Eco Red Shield SP ™ (Sill Plate) are compliant with 2009, 2012 and 2015 versions of the International Building Code and International Residential Code. DrJ Engineering is an ANSI ISO/IEC 17065 accredited certification body and compliant with IBC Section 1703.
 
On September 4, 2012, the Company successfully achieved QAI Laboratories (QAI) listing B1053-1, providing evidence that Eco Red Shield’s fire protection qualities now meet building code requirements for Class “A”, structural rated, flammability performance on Douglas Fir solid sawn lumber, making Eco Red Shield protected lumber an alternate to the traditionally accepted fire retardant treated wood (FRTW) for interior use. On April 26, 2016, the Company was successful in testing and qualifying Spruce (SPF) species to be added to our approvals for use as an alternate for FRTW uses. As a matter of routine, the Company duplicated and successfully tested SPF at QAI Labs on June 28, 2016.

Achieving the QAI listing for flame spread properties makes Eco Red Shield protection the first topical wood treatment of its kind for interior Class “A” flammability. Additionally, providing protection against Wood Ingesting Organisms including Formosan Termites and Wood-Rot Decay to meet building code requirements. Building officials, architects, contractors, specifiers, designers and others utilize QAI listings and product labeling to provide a basis for using or approving Eco Red Shield coated lumber products in construction projects under the International Building Code. The Company will continue to qualify other species and panel products for similar ratings. The Company has also received approval for Eco Red Shield in Hawaii and the City of Los Angeles to achieve the issuance of an LA Research Report.
 
Since 2013, the Company has engaged with QAI Laboratories, a similar consumer rating and product monitoring agency as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), to certify the coating process and provide a listing for the fire efficacy of Eco Red Shield treated lumber products.
 
The Company has further engaged QAI Laboratories as the third-party factory Quality Control auditing company, providing audit services and third party inspections to all ESR listed facilities, and facilities producing Eco Red Shield for the purposes of satisfying FRTW lumber per ASTM E84 requirements. Eco Red Shield is now successfully qualified to produce code approved lumber products in five locations across the country. Having the ability to stamp/label the lumber with the equivalence to traditional pressure treated lumber presents enormous opportunities in the supply chain, and not limited to, Big Box Retailers, national homebuilding supply companies, wholesalers and manufacturers.
 
Patents:
 
The Company has two patents pending: The patent application, entitled “Formulation and Method for Preserving Wood,” was filed August 16, 2016 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and has been accorded United States Patent Application No. 15/238,463. The application not only encompasses the Company’s Wood Surface Film Concentrate™ (WSFC™) formulation, but also its derivative formulations including Eco SP™, Eco AFL™ and Eco FT™. The Company’s second patent application, entitled Fire Inhibitor Formulation on November 4, 2016, was accorded United States Patent Application No. 15/344,298 as a continuation-in-part application of Eco’s USPTO Application No. 15/238,463, entitled Formulation and Method for Preserving Wood. On March 30, 2018, the USPTO converted USPTO Application No. 15/238,463 into Patent No. 9,920,250.
 
Trademarks: The Company has filed for trademark protection on various service marks in several categories to include the “Eco” logo, “Eco Red Shield” name, “FRC Technology” - Fire Retardant Coatings and “Wood Surface Film” technology.
 
Customers Relationships: We have three Customers that are approved to produce our Eco Red Shield product in various locations around the USA. We have a formal written agreement with one of these customers while the other two customers purchase chemical concentrates and adhere to our quality control program. Revenues that are generated from our customers are booked as chemical sales. The Company has also developed an customer coating program that allows lumber companies to coat commodity lumber at their mills/facilities.
 
Competitive Advantages
 
Management believes the Company is positioned to penetrate both the unprotected, overall softwood lumber market as well as the incumbent wood preservation market (pressure treated).
 
Traditional wood preservation technology employs a mechanical impregnation process of pounding wood fiber with water bourn chemicals under extreme pressure which breaks down its cellular structure, substantially degrading strength values. In addition, many of these chemicals have been identified as toxic. As a result, treated lumber has been limited in its application and makes whole house protection impractical and or undesirable.
 
In contrast, Eco Red Shield™ impregnates wood fiber thru the process of diffusion whereby environmentally friendly chemicals are encased in a semi-permeable barrier that allows it to breathe while locking in mold, termite, rot and fire protections.
 
At the same time the semi-permeable barrier minimizes naturally occurring formaldehyde off-gassing. The process and chemistry have no adverse effect on strength values and puts whole house protection within reach of the average homeowner.
 
There is a growing awareness and latent demand that stems from the importance of indoor air quality (IAQ); the structural risks associated with wood decay from termites and rot and the heightened risks from fire with modern construction materials and techniques.

Tested in accordance to ASTM D5116 – Small Scale Environmental Chamber Determinations of Organic Emissions from indoor Materials and D5197 – Test Method for Determination of Formaldehyde and other Carbonyl Compounds in Air. Meets California 01350 limits for formaldehyde emissions. 

Competition
 
We believe that our products are positioned to capture significant market share of the current non-treated wood market. The treated wood market is mature with large established chemical manufacturers, with functionally equivalent technologies and fierce competition. However, we appear to have a unique product with a combination mold, rot, decay, termite and fire inhibitor that meets HUD standards for above ground structural and sheathing wood components. This, combined with a low cost, easy to deploy treating operation positions the Company to disrupt the Industry.
 
Chemical supply to the Wood Preservation Industry is dominated by four incumbent players – Koppers, Inc., Hoover Treated Wood Products, Inc., Viance and Arch/Lonza Chemicals, Inc. It is likely that competitors will field their own offerings, and while a few already exist in partial or equivalent form to Eco Red Shield™, none have successfully commercialized a complete alternative.
 
It is likely that competitors will field their own offerings, and a few already exist in partial or equivalent form, such as Frame Guard and Wolman® AG wood treatment offered by Arch/Lonza Chemical, TRUE-CORE® offered by Kop-Coat and Nature Wood offered by Osmose, Inc. These products and more are continuing to show up in the market as a result of ECOB’s marketing and promotional efforts to raise awareness for the need and market potential for topical coatings. To date none of these topical coatings have the full suite of protection offered by Eco Red Shield. These chemical companies sell to independent wood treaters and lumberyards.
 
The Fire Pressure Treating Industry is dominated by three incumbent players – Koppers, Inc., Hoover Treated Wood Products, Inc. and Arch/Lonza Chemicals, Inc. It is likely that competitors will field their own offerings, and a few already exist in partial or equivalent form, such as Frame Guard offered by Arch/Lonza Chemical and Nature Wood offered by Osmose, Inc.
 
ECOB’s vision is to provide affordable protection against mold, termites, wood rot decay and fire for every wood framed structure.
 
Employees
 
As of June 30, 2017, we had 4 full time employees consisting of Mr. Tom Comery, our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Mark Vuozzo, our Chief Technical Officer, a Controller and a Director of Operations. Mr. Vuozzo was put on unpaid administrative leave on or about June 30, 2017 and has subsequently left the company.
 
After our fiscal year end of June 30, 2017, the Company hired Jinxue Jiang, PhD. as the Company’s Director of Chemistry and Technology. Dr. Jiang officially assumed his new role on August 14, 2017. He will be responsible for leading the Company’s scientific efforts including research and new product development. Dr. Jiang is also the author of fifteen peer reviewed papers and two patents and is considered a subject matter expert in the areas of wood physics and chemistry as well as polymer science. He has extensive experience in wood protection, high performance composites, adhesives and coatings as well as intumescent fire retardants.
 
We expect to continue to use contract labor, management consultants, attorneys, accountants, engineers, and other professionals as necessary to support our management and administrative requirements. The need for employees and their availability will be addressed on a continuing basis.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
The use of assets and/or conduct of business that we are pursuing will be subject to environmental, public health and safety, land use, trade, EPA and other governmental regulations, as well as state and/or local taxation. The coating product offered by the Company, Eco Red Shield, falls into the “Treated Article Exemption 40 CFR 152.25(a) as stated by the EPA. The company has taken all necessary steps including legal review of all claims made to assure strict compliance for product claims meeting the treated article exemption. Furthermore, compliance with product labeling of all constituents employed in the manufacturing have been reviewed by third party consultants to insure proper use as specified by product manufacturers. These consultants ensure that product labeling is in strict compliance with local, state and federal regulations as represented in the original manufacturer - or supplier-published materials. In acquiring and/or developing businesses in the wood treatment industry, management will endeavor to ascertain, to the extent possible due to its current limited resources, the effects of such government regulation on our prospective business. In certain circumstances, however, such as the acquisition of an interest in a new or start-up business activity, it may not be possible to predict with any degree of accuracy the impact of all potential government regulation. Additionally, ECOB complies with Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
