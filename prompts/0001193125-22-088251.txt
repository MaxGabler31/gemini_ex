Introduction 
 Achari Ventures Holdings Corp. I (“the Company”) is a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination. While we may pursue an initial business combination with any business in any industry, commercial sector or location, our initial focus is on identifying acquisition opportunities in the cannabis industry. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not invest in or consummate a business combination with a target business that we determine has been operating in violation of U.S. federal laws, including the Controlled Substances Act. 
 The Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a business combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. 
 General 
 Achari Ventures, a venture capital fund, was founded by Vikas Desai in 2018, as an investment firm focused on the rapidly growing cannabis industry, is an affiliate of our Sponsor. Achari Ventures currently has an executive team and advisory board consisting of seasoned investment professionals, with experience and pedigree investing within all stages of the capital markets from seed to initial public offerings, or IPOs. In addition, Achari Ventures has a cannabis advisory network, consisting of entrepreneurs and CEOs with proven track records of successful operations in the highly regulated cannabis space. During the past three years, Achari Ventures has evaluated more than 1,500 companies related to the cannabis industry, built a vast network of business contacts, and invested in more than 15 companies. With this team and track record, Achari Ventures believes it is positioned to become a leading institutional-quality investment firm in this nascent, burgeoning and fragmented industry. 
 On October 19, 2021, the Company consummated its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 10,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consisted of one share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), and one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase three quarters of one share of Common Stock for $11.50 per share, provided however that Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of Common Stock. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $100,000,000. 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, pursuant to the Sponsor Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the private sale of an aggregate of 7,133,333 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to Achari Sponsor Holdings I LLC (“Sponsor”) at a purchase price of $0.75 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $5,350,000. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants included in the Units sold as part of the Units in the IPO, except as otherwise disclosed in the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1 relating to the IPO (the “Registration Statement”). No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
 A total of $101,500,000, comprised of a portion of the proceeds from the IPO after offering expenses and the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes (less up to $100,000 interest to pay dissolution expenses), the funds held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any of the Company’s public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company’s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (a) to modify the substance or timing of its obligation to redeem 100% of the Company’s public shares if it does not complete its initial business combination within 15 months (or 18 months, if extended upon request by our Sponsor and through resolution of our board of directors, as described in the Registration Statement) from the October 19, 2021 closing of the IPO or (b) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of the Company’s public shares if it is unable to complete its initial business combination within 15 months (or 18 months, if extended upon request by our Sponsor and through resolution of our board of directors, as described in the Registration Statement) from the October 19, 2021 closing of the IPO, subject to applicable law. The funds placed in the trust account are being invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the trust account, as described below

 Number and Terms of Office of Officers and Directors 
 We have seven directors and our board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of stockholders) serving a three-year term. In accordance with Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on Nasdaq. The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Seth Farbman and Kevin K. Albert, will expire at our first annual meeting of stockholders. The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Harry DeMott, Mark A. Pelson and Timothy J. Seymour, will expire at the second annual meeting of stockholders. The term of office of the third class of directors, consisting of Vikas Desai and Merrick Friedman, will expire at the third annual meeting of stockholders. 
 Our officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our bylaws as it deems appropriate. Our bylaws provide that our officers may consist of a Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Vice Presidents, Secretary, Treasurer, Assistant Secretaries and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. 
 Acquisition Strategy 
 Our acquisition plan is to leverage our management team’s networks of potential transaction sources where we believe a combination of our management team’s industry relationships, knowledge and experience could effect a positive transformation of existing businesses or assets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and board of directors have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe serve as a useful source of acquisition opportunities. We plan to leverage relationships with management teams of public and private companies, investment professionals at private equity firms and other financial sponsors, owners of private businesses, investment bankers, restructuring advisers, consultants, attorneys and accountants, which we believe should provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will not invest in or consummate a business combination with a target business that we determine has been operating in violation of U.S. federal laws or that intends to operate in violation of such laws, including the Controlled Substances Act.

  Investment Criteria 
 Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general, non-exclusive criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective targets for our initial business combination. We are using these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet one or more of these criteria and guidelines except that we will not enter into an initial business combination with a target that operates or plans to operate in violation of U.S. federal law, including the Controlled Substances Act. We expect to weigh potential upside from growth in the target business and an improved capital structure against any identified downside risks. We intend to focus on target businesses with the following characteristics: 

• | Historical and expected growth tracking or exceeding the industry average (30% + CAGR);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | At least $50 million of revenue with clear pathway to $200 million over five years;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong, proven management team with execution capability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Track record of capital efficiency;
--+------------------------------------


• | Fragmented vertical with clear opportunity for consolidation and mergers and acquisitions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Accretive cash flow and margin profile with sizable organic revenue growth potential;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Alignment of long-term vision and willingness to retain equity; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clear pathway for transition towards mid- and large-cap designation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. Our search is focused on mission critical, sleepier verticals and strong organic growth trajectories within the cannabis industry. These verticals will have clear fragmentation and an opportunity for the market leader to consolidate “mom and pop” using accretive public stock. 
 We initially identified (not exclusively) four vertical markets that fit the above criteria: 
 Equipment 
 

• | Mission critical equipment to plant touching companies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Extraction, agriculture, and post-processing machinery; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Defensible profit margins due to competitive advantage and intellectual property, or IP.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hardware 
 

• | Ability to scale in a capital-efficient manner;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Substantial brand equity and preference over competition;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Novel intellectual property and IP moat;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | Ancillary revenue stream via recurring revenue or tech-enabled offering; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mission critical hardware for business and consumers.
--+------------------------------------------------------

Technology 
 

• | Focus on B2B and B2B2C business models;
--+----------------------------------------


• | E-commerce, delivery, marketplaces and seed-to-sale;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Clear market leader with outsized market share penetration; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Demonstrated utility above competition and flywheel to continue growth.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------



6 

  Hydroponics 
 

• | Farming equipment, precision agriculture and cultivation inputs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preference towards e-commerce vs. brick and mortar;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Clear market leader relative to competition;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | Demonstrated ability to conduct mergers and acquisitions with strong future pipeline; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Differentiation through brand.
--+-------------------------------

Industry Opportunity 
 While we may pursue an initial business combination with any business in any industry, commercial sector or location, our initial focus is on identifying acquisition opportunities in the cannabis industry globally. The cannabis industry has experienced significant growth over the last several years. With full federal legalization in Canada and 36 states and Washington D.C. in the United States allowing for some type of legal use under state law, the cannabis industry is amongst the fastest growing industries in the world. We believe that the normalization of cannabis and its many uses—both therapeutic and recreational—is creating a rarely seen opportunity to invest in related businesses. At the same time, the cannabis industry is highly fragmented and subject to a complex regulatory framework, creating significant barriers to entry. 
 The transition of the cannabis and derivative products industries to a regulated and legal marketplace has been happening at a rapid pace over recent years. Many countries have or are contemplating some form of legalized use, including Canada and the United States. For example, on June 28, 2018, the Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act was introduced in the United States Senate, which would remove marijuana from the schedule of controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act and decriminalize its use. We believe that this momentum will continue to accelerate worldwide, generating tremendous opportunity in the industry, with both broader legislative acceptance and an evolving regulatory environment. There have already been hundreds of businesses launched across various sub-sectors of the cannabis industry, many of which are located in Canada or the United States. These businesses have raised billions of dollars from investors in public and private markets; including strategic investments from major multinational companies that are altering or broadening their core business focus. Many of these businesses have valuations more than a billion dollars. However, the cannabis industry is still in early innings. In order to succeed under the new legislative and regulatory frameworks, we believe that businesses will need strong management teams with deep operational expertise and financial acumen. 
 As this industry evolves from a nascent industry cycle, often with high levels of return, we believe that investors will become more discerning and will focus on business models that can scale profitably. Despite high profile recent investments, we believe the total amount of invested capital in the space is small relative to other major industry sectors of similar size. As the industry evolves and legislative and regulatory hurdles are addressed, we anticipate an institutionalization of capital investment, with reduced reliance on high-net-worth individuals, family offices and select hedge funds. We believe that this will be demonstrated by new investors providing sources of liquidity that will resemble more mature markets, including increased breadth of financial instruments across the capital structure. As a result, we would expect the cost of capital to come down, allowing companies to grow more accretively. 
 We believe that the cannabis industry will continue to grow at a rapid pace in the coming years—with the potential to reach several hundred billion dollars of sales within the next ten years. Unlike other emerging industries, which have been driven by massive technological advances, cannabis has supported therapeutic treatments for thousands of years across a variety of cultures. The evolution of public perception is being sustained by consumers seeking cannabis-based treatments for a variety of health and wellness needs. We believe that there will be growth via the broader adoption of cannabis for non-recreational use. Potential sources for additional growth include the disruption of a variety of health-related market segments including pain management, sleep, skin care and cosmetics and anxiety, as well as many other applications that are being explored.

  Effecting a Business Combination 
 General 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from one or a combination of the following: the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement of the private warrants, proceeds from the sale of additional securities, the issuance of shares or other securities, or new debt, other than our search for a target business with which to effect an initial business combination. We may seek to consummate our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth (such as a company that has begun operations but is not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales), which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 
 If our initial business combination is paid for using shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account that is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 Since the consummation of the IPO, we have focused on identifying, doing due diligence on and speaking to management of potential target companies in a variety of markets within our target sectors. Subject to the requirement that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses or assets having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into such initial business combination, we have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses. 
 We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would consummate such financing only simultaneously with the consummation of our business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law or Nasdaq, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. 
 Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. We have also agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our Sponsor.

  We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% fair market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. 
 We will have up to 15 months from the October 19, 2021 closing of our IPO to consummate an initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within such 15 month period, we may, by resolution of our board of directors if requested by our Sponsor, extend once the period of time we will have to consummate an initial business combination by an additional 3 months (for a total of 18 months from the October 19, 2021 closing of the IPO). Provided that, pursuant to the terms of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on October 14, 2021, the only way to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination in the absence of a definitive agreement is for our Sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon 5 days’ advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, to deposit into the trust account $1,000,000 ($0.10 per share), or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. Our public stockholders will not be entitled to vote or redeem their shares in connection with such extension. In the event that our Sponsor elects to extend the time to complete a business combination and deposits the applicable amount of money into trust, the Sponsor would receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination, unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of our Sponsor. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. In the event that we receive notice from our Sponsor 5 days prior to the applicable deadline of its intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our Sponsor and its affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our Sponsor’s affiliates or designees decide to extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (and up to $100,000 interest to pay dissolution expenses), and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders. 
 Sources of Target Businesses 
 We believe that there are several target businesses that could benefit from our partnership. In the United States, this would currently include non-plant touching businesses operating in compliance with the Controlled Substances Act and other federal laws that support the functioning of cannabis activity but are not directly related to cultivation, manufacturing, processing, branding, transportation, distribution, storage or sale of cannabis and cannabis-based products. We may also consider companies pursuing an FDA track for pharmaceutical applications and treatments that entail compounds found in cannabis. There are also a number of qualifying cannabis-related licensed operators in industries outside of the United States. This includes companies currently operating in jurisdictions where cannabis has been decriminalized for recreational use, such as Canada, Colombia and Uruguay. Globally, more than 50 countries have legalized some form of medical cannabis. Over the 15 months (or 18 months, if extended as described herein) period following the closing of our IPO on October 19, 2021, we believe that legislative activity in certain jurisdictions will further broaden our opportunity set for eligible acquisitions.

  Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination 
 Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general, non-exclusive criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective targets for our initial business combination. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet one or more of these criteria and guidelines except that we will not enter into an initial business combination with a target that operates or plans to operate in violation of U.S. federal law, including the Controlled Substances Act. We expect to weigh potential upside from growth in the target business and an improved capital structure against any identified downside risks. We are initially focusing on target businesses with the following characteristics: 
 

• | Historical and expected growth tracking or exceeding the industry average (30% + CAGR);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | At least $50 million of revenue with clear pathway to $200 million over five years;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong, proven management team with execution capability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Track record of capital efficiency;
--+------------------------------------


• | Fragmented vertical with clear opportunity for consolidation and mergers and acquisitions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Accretive cash flow and margin profile with sizable organic revenue growth potential;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Alignment of long-term vision and willingness to retain equity; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clear pathway for transition towards mid- and large-cap designation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. Our search will focus on mission critical, sleepier verticals and strong organic growth trajectories within the cannabis industry. These verticals will have clear fragmentation and an opportunity for the market leader to consolidate “mom and pop” using accretive public stock. 
 We have initially identified (not exclusively) four vertical markets that fit the above criteria: 
 Equipment 
 

• | Mission critical equipment to plant touching companies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Extraction, agriculture, and post-processing machinery; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Defensible profit margins due to competitive advantage and intellectual property, or IP.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hardware 
 

• | Ability to scale in a capital-efficient manner;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Substantial brand equity and preference over competition;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Novel intellectual property and IP moat;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | Ancillary revenue stream via recurring revenue or tech-enabled offering; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mission critical hardware for business and consumers.
--+------------------------------------------------------



10 

  Technology 
 

• | Focus on B2B and B2B2C business models;
--+----------------------------------------


• | E-commerce, delivery, marketplaces and seed-to-sale;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Clear market leader with outsized market share penetration; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Demonstrated utility above competition and flywheel to continue growth.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hydroponics 
 

• | Farming equipment, precision agriculture and cultivation inputs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preference towards e-commerce vs. brick and mortar;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Clear market leader relative to competition;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | Demonstrated ability to conduct mergers and acquisitions with strong future pipeline; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Differentiation through brand.
--+-------------------------------

Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 
 In recent years, the number of special purpose acquisition companies that have been formed has increased substantially. Many companies have entered into business combinations with special purpose acquisition companies and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies seeking targets for their initial business combination, as well as many additional special purpose acquisition companies currently in registration. As a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be available, and it may require more time, effort and resources to identify a suitable target for an initial business combination. 
 In addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies seeking to enter into an initial business combination with available targets, the competition for available targets with attractive fundamentals or business models may increase, which could cause target companies to demand improved financial terms. Attractive deals could also become scarcer for other reasons, such as economic or industry sector downturns, geopolitical tensions or increases in the cost of additional capital needed to close business combinations or operate targets post-business combination. This could increase the cost of, delay or otherwise complicate or frustrate our ability to find a suitable target for and/or complete our initial business combination. 
 Management Operating and Investment Experience 
 Our management team is comprised of Vikas Desai, Merrick Friedman, and Mitchell Hara. The team has broad experience in identifying targets and acquiring businesses under diverse market conditions. We believe our management team is well-positioned to identify and evaluate businesses within the cannabis sector given their skills, industry knowledge, and experience operating in the public markets. We believe our management team offers extensive experience in growing and operating companies as well as a deep and diverse network of contacts in the cannabis sector. 
 In aggregate, the team has over 30 years of traditional investment experience, over 28 years of mergers and acquisitions experience, and six and a half years of cannabis operating and investing experience. The management team has a track record of demonstrated success in the cannabis industry and has proven the ability to source deals, conduct rigorous due diligence, structure transactions, and guide companies via board representation.

  We intend to be actively involved in the strategy and operations of our target companies and have assembled several seasoned corporate executives and investors to serve as independent directors. These executives have been chosen for their extensive sector experience within cannabis, venture capital/private equity, and/or as executives at high-growth companies managing a go-public transaction. In addition to providing us with strategic insights which include in-depth knowledge of industry dynamics, competition and operational capabilities, our independent directors will provide access to their broad network of operating executives and other resources. 
 Our independent directors are comprised of Mark A. Pelson, Seth Farbman, Kevin K. Albert, Harry DeMott and Timothy J. Seymour. The directors bring expertise and experience that will help facilitate the sourcing, diligence, and execution of a successful transaction as well as navigate the nuances and intricacies of public market dynamics. In the aggregate, our independent directors have served as c-suite executives and have been instrumental in bringing companies public via IPO or direct listing (i.e. Mr. Farbman was the Chief Marketing Officer of Spotify Inc. during its initial public offering). 
 Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our public shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30. 
 Employees 
 We currently have three officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.

  Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 Our units, shares, and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors. You can read our SEC filings over the internet at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, U.S. GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
