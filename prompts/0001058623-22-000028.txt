Description of Certain Definitions and Data
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Form 10-K" or this "Report") the terms "Company," "Cumulus," "CUMULUS MEDIA," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Cumulus Media Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We use the term "local marketing agreement" ("LMA") in this Report. In a typical LMA, the licensee of a radio station makes available, for a fee and reimbursement of its expenses, airtime on its station to a party which supplies programming to be broadcast during that airtime, and collects revenues from advertising aired during such programming. 
Unless otherwise indicated, as disclosed herein we:
•obtained total radio industry listener and revenue levels from the Radio Advertising Bureau;
•derived historical market revenue statistics and market revenue share percentages from data published by Miller Kaplan, Arase LLP, a public accounting firm that specializes in serving the broadcasting industry and BIA/Kelsey, a media and telecommunications advisory services firm; and
•derived all audience share data and audience rankings, including ranking by population, from surveys of people ages 12 and over, listening Monday through Sunday, 6 a.m. to 12 midnight, as reported in the Nielsen Audio ("Nielsen") Market Report.

We are a Delaware corporation, organized in 2018, and the successor to a Delaware corporation with the same name that was organized in 2002. Our predecessor, CM Wind Down Topco Inc. (formerly known as Cumulus Media, Inc., "Old Cumulus"), and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for bankruptcy relief in November 2017. Old Cumulus and its debtor subsidiaries emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 4, 2018 and, prior to winding down its business, it transferred substantially all of its remaining assets to an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of reorganized Cumulus Media Inc. (formerly known as CM Emergence Newco Inc. and now known as "CUMULUS MEDIA" or the "Company"). 
Strategic Overview
We are focused on building our competitive position in the expanding audio landscape by achieving leadership positions in the markets in which we operate and leveraging those positions in conjunction with our network platform, national scale, and local advertiser relationships to build value for all of our stakeholders. The Company seeks to achieve our objective through the execution of three specific strategies:
•enhancing operating performance to drive cash flow generation through the execution of a range of initiatives across both our radio station and network platforms to maintain or grow market share, reduce costs and improve efficiency; 
•expanding high growth digital businesses in local marketing services and new audio formats such as podcasting and streaming; and
•optimizing our asset portfolio by taking advantage of opportunities to strengthen our position in markets where we are, or can become, leaders and to exit markets or dispose of assets that are not supportive of our objectives if we can do so accretively. 
Competitive Strengths 
We believe our success is, and future performance will be, directly related to the following combination of characteristics that will facilitate the implementation of our strategies: 
Leadership in the radio broadcasting industry and new audio formats
Currently, we offer advertisers access to a broad portfolio of 406 owned and operated stations, operating in 86 markets and more than 9,500 network affiliates with an aggregate monthly reach of over a quarter billion listeners. Our stations and affiliates cover a wide variety of programming formats, geographic regions and audience demographics, and we engage with audiences through over-the-air, digital (including streaming and podcasting) and live interactions. This scale and diversity allow us to offer advertisers the ability to customize advertising campaigns on a national, regional and local basis through broadcast, digital and mobile mediums, as well as through live events, enabling us to compete effectively with other media and engage listeners whenever they want and wherever they are.
Leading Digital Platform
The Cumulus Podcast Network connects passionate listeners with America’s most influential voices. Ranked among the top five podcast networks in the country, we focus on personality-driven talk partnering with extraordinary content creators to build national, multi-platform franchises. We also create local podcasts in 86 markets whose content entertains and informs the communities they serve. We monetize audiences through our extensive national and local ad sales teams and deep, longstanding relationships with performance and brand advertisers. Podcast advertisements include prerecorded spots and on-air reads by talent who provide personal endorsements of advertisers' products. To the extent our talent has won the trust of their audiences, such endorsements can be well-received by listeners and therefore valuable to advertisers who are eager to capture the favorable attention of new and existing customers for their products. In addition, we sell an array of local digital marketing services such as, email marketing, geo-targeted display and video solutions, website building and hosting, social media management, reputation management and search engine marketing and optimization within our Cumulus C-Suite digital marketing solutions portfolio to existing and new advertisers.
National reach
As one of the largest radio advertising and content providers in the United States (the "U.S."), we provide a national platform which allows us to more effectively and efficiently compete for national and network advertising dollars. Our exclusive radio broadcast partnerships with the NFL and NCAA allow us to provide advertisers with national reach and the ability to create compelling campaigns from a local to a national level across broadcast, digital and live event offerings.
In addition, our national network platform provides targeted access to diverse demographics and age groups to better meet our customers' needs. Our sales team has the ability to aggregate advertising inventory time across our owned and operated and/or affiliate networks, and divide it into packages focused on specific demographics that can be sold to national advertisers looking to reach specific national or regional audiences. 
Diversified customer base and geographic mix
We generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of advertising time to a broad and diverse customer base, including local advertisers based in our 86 cities or "markets" in which we own radio stations as well as advertisers based outside those markets through our national network and spot ad sales. We sell our advertising time both nationally and locally through an integrated sales approach, including online couponing and various on-air and digital integrated marketing programs. 
Our advertising exposure is highly diversified across a broad range of industries, which lessens the impact of the economic conditions applicable to any one specific industry or customer group. Our top industry segments by advertising volume include professional services, financial, home products, automotive and entertainment. We derive additional revenue from political candidates, political parties, and special interest groups particularly in even-numbered years in advance of various elections. 
Focus on corporate culture
We believe maintaining a corporate culture that supports employee engagement has been, and will continue to be, important to our continued success. We believe our rigorous and systematic cultural values framework, FORCE (Focused, Responsible, Collaborative, and Empowered), has created motivated employees who are invested in both their jobs and the Company's progress as well as a culture that serves as a critical catalyst to driving higher performance and attracting new talent to the Company.
Ability to leverage content and advertiser relationships across platforms
Our various content platforms, including local stations, the Westwood One network and our growing podcast and streaming businesses, provide diversified content to build relationships with listeners as well as access to a broader base of talent across those platforms. We have had recent success in extending content from one platform to another (such as from local radio to network syndication and from podcasting to broadcast radio) to build audiences and monetization opportunities and expect to continue to do so increasingly in the future. Additionally, the multiple contacts our local sales people have with their clients over the course of a year often give them a degree of familiarity with their clients' needs and the ability to tailor campaigns to help them achieve success. Over the last several years, those interactions allowed us to expand our support of new and existing clients' business objectives by offering additional products, including, most importantly, digital marketing services, which generally supplement radio buys.
Industry Overview
The primary source of revenues for radio broadcasting companies is the sale of advertising time to local, regional and national spot advertisers and network advertisers. 
Generally, radio is considered an efficient, cost-effective means of reaching specifically identified demographic groups with advertising. Stations are typically classified by their on-air format, such as country, rock, adult contemporary, oldies and news/talk. A station's format and style of presentation enables it to target specific segments of listeners sharing certain demographic qualities. Advertisers and stations use data published by audience measurement services, such as Nielsen, to estimate how many people within particular geographical markets and demographics listen to specific stations. By capturing a specific share of a market's radio listening audience with particular concentration in a targeted demographic, a station is able to market its broadcasting time to advertisers seeking to reach a specific audience. 
The number of advertisements that can be broadcast by a station without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings is generally dictated in part by the format of a particular station and the local competitive environment. Although the number of advertisements broadcast during a given time period may vary, the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year.
A station's local sales staff generates the majority of its local and regional advertising sales through direct solicitations of local advertising agencies and businesses. To generate national advertising sales, a station usually will engage a firm that specializes in soliciting radio-advertising sales on a national level. Stations also may engage directly with an internal national sales team that supports the efforts of third-party representatives. National sales representatives obtain advertising principally from advertising agencies located outside the station's market and receive commissions based on the revenue from the advertising they obtain.
Radio stations compete for advertising revenue with other broadcast radio stations in their particular market as well as other media, including newspapers, broadcast television, cable television, magazines, direct mail, and outdoor advertising as well as search engine, e-commerce and other websites and satellite-based digital radio and music services. 
Advertising Sales
The majority of our revenue is generated from the sale of local, regional, and national advertising which is broadcast on our radio stations. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of commercial airtime our network receives from its radio station affiliates (and aggregates for sale to national advertisers) in exchange for programming and services. To a lesser extent, we also purchase commercial inventory to sell through our network and in some instances also receive cash from affiliates for network programming and services. 
Our major advertiser categories are:

Automotive | General services | Restaurants 
Entertainment | Home products | Retail 
Financial | Professional services | Telecommunications/Media

In addition, in advance of various elections, we derive revenue from political candidates, political parties, and special interest groups, particularly in even-numbered years.
Each station's local sales staff solicits advertising either directly from a local advertiser or indirectly through an advertising agency. We use a tiered commission structure to focus our sales staff on new business development. We believe that we can outperform our competitors by (1) expanding our base of advertisers, (2) properly training sales people and (3) providing a higher level of service to our existing customer base. 
Advertising sales to national spot advertisers for our radio stations are made by a firm specializing in radio advertising sales on the national level, in exchange for a commission that is based on the gross revenue from the advertising generated. Regional sales, which we define as sales in regions surrounding our markets to buyers that advertise in our markets, are generally made by our local sales staff and market managers. While we seek to grow our local sales through more customer-focused sales staff, we seek to grow our national and regional sales by offering key national and regional advertisers access to groups of stations within specific markets and regions that make us a more attractive platform. 
Each of our stations has a certain amount of on-air inventory, or advertising slots, in which to place advertising spots. This level of advertising inventory may vary at different times of the day but tends to remain stable over time. Our stations strive to maximize revenue by managing their on-air advertising inventory and adjusting prices up or down based on supply and demand. We seek to broaden our advertiser base in each market by providing a wide array of audience demographic groups across each cluster of stations, thereby providing potential advertisers with an effective means to reach a targeted demographic group. Our sales volume and pricing is based on demand for our radio stations' on-air inventory. Most changes in revenue are explained by a combination of demand-driven pricing changes and changes in inventory utilization rather than by changes in available inventory. Advertising rates charged by radio stations, which are generally highest during morning and afternoon commuting hours, are based primarily on:
•a station's share of audiences and the demographic groups targeted by advertisers (as measured by ratings surveys);
•the supply and demand for radio advertising time and for time targeted at particular demographic groups in a given market; and
•certain additional qualitative factors, such as the brand loyalty of listeners to a specific station.
A station's listenership is reflected in ratings surveys, where available, that estimate the number of listeners tuned in to the station, and the time they spend listening. Each station's ratings are used by its advertisers and advertising representatives to consider advertising with the station and are used by Cumulus to chart changes in audience, set advertising rates and adjust programming.
Competition 
The radio broadcasting industry is very competitive. Our stations compete for listeners and advertising revenues directly with other radio stations within their respective markets, as well as with other news, information and entertainment media. Additionally, we compete with various digital platforms and services, including streaming music and other entertainment services for both listeners and advertisers. We cannot predict how existing or new sources of competition will affect our performance and results of operations. 
Factors that affect a radio station's competitive position include station brand identity and loyalty, the attractiveness of the station's programming content to audiences, the station's local audience rating and share in its market, transmitter power and location, assigned frequency, audience characteristics, local program acceptance and the number and characteristics of other radio stations and other advertising media in the market area. We attempt to improve our competitive position in each market through research, seeking to improve our stations' programming, implementing targeted advertising campaigns aimed at the demographic groups for which our stations program and managing our sales efforts to attract a larger share of advertising dollars for each station individually. We also seek to improve our competitive position by focusing on building a strong brand identity with a targeted listener base consisting of specific demographic groups in each of our markets, which we believe will allow us to better attract advertisers seeking to reach those listeners. 
The success of each of our stations depends largely upon rates it can charge for its advertising, which in turn is affected by the number of local advertising competitors, the overall demand for advertising within individual markets and the station's listener base. These conditions may fluctuate and are highly susceptible to changes in both local markets and general macroeconomic conditions. Specifically, a radio station's competitive position can be enhanced or negatively impacted by a variety of factors, including the changing of, or another station changing, its format to compete directly for a certain demographic of listeners and advertisers or an upgrade of the station's authorized power through the relocation or upgrade of transmission equipment. Another station's decision to convert to a similar format to that of one of our radio stations in the same geographic area, to improve its signal reach through equipment changes or upgrades, or to launch an aggressive promotional campaign may result in lower ratings and advertising revenue for our station. Any adverse change affecting advertising expenditures in a particular market or in the relative market share of our stations located in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the results of our radio stations located in that market or, possibly, the Company as a whole. There can be no assurance that any one or all of our stations will be able to maintain or increase advertising revenue market share.
Under federal laws and Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") rules, a single party can own and operate multiple stations in a local market, subject to certain limitations described below. We believe that companies that form groups of commonly owned stations or joint arrangements, such as LMAs, in a particular market may, in certain circumstances, have lower operating costs and may be able to offer advertisers in those markets more attractive rates and services. Although we currently operate multiple stations in most of our markets and may pursue the creation of additional multiple station groups in particular markets, our competitors in certain markets include other parties that own and operate as many or more stations as we do.
Some of these regulations, however, can serve to protect the competitive position of existing radio stations to some extent by creating certain regulatory barriers to new entrants. The ownership of a radio broadcast station requires an FCC license, and the number of radio stations that an entity can own in a given market is limited under certain FCC rules. These FCC ownership rules may, in some instances, limit the number of stations we or our competitors can own or operate, or may limit potential new market entrants. However, FCC ownership rules may change in the future to reduce any protections they currently provide. We also cannot predict what other matters might be considered in the future by the FCC or Congress, including, for instance, radio royalty bills, nor can we assess in advance what impact, if any, the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business. For a discussion of FCC regulation (including recent changes), see "Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting" within Item 1, "Business."
Human Capital
We believe that our rigorous focus on our culture strategy has motivated our employees who are invested in both their jobs and the Company's progress. Their engagement serves not only to drive higher performance, but also helps to attract new talent to the Company. It also enables us to retain valuable members of our team. We consistently monitor our cultural progress through frequent survey and feedback mechanisms. This allows us to build on proven practices, while adjusting as necessary in order to achieve the highest possible levels of employee engagement.
The high engagement of our workforce underpins the Company’s ability to swiftly react to challenges as they arise. In the face of the novel coronavirus disease ("COVID-19") pandemic, our employees navigated through the unprecedented circumstances with professionalism, creativity, and resiliency. 
As of December 31, 2021, our workforce comprised 3,488 people, 2,588 of whom were employed full-time. Of these employees, approximately 112 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any material work stoppages by our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, and overall, we consider our relations with our employees to be positive.
On occasion, we enter into contracts with various on-air personalities who have large, loyal audiences in their respective markets. We do that in order to protect our interests in those relationships that we believe to be valuable. The loss of one of these personalities could result in a short-term loss of audience share, but we do not believe that any such loss would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Seasonality and Cyclicality
Our advertising revenues vary by quarter throughout the year. As is typical with advertising revenue supported businesses, our first calendar quarter typically produces the lowest revenues of any quarter during the year, as advertising generally declines following the winter holidays. The second and fourth calendar quarters typically produce the highest revenues for the year. In addition, our revenues tend to fluctuate between years, consistent with, among other things, increased 
advertising expenditures in even-numbered years by political candidates, political parties and special interest groups. Typically, this political spending is heaviest during the fourth quarter.
Inflation
To date, inflation has not had a material effect on our revenues, expenses, or results of operations, although no assurances can be provided that inflation in the future would not materially adversely affect us.
Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting
The ownership, operation and sale of radio broadcast stations, including those licensed to us, are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under authority of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Communications Act"). Among its other regulatory responsibilities, the FCC issues permits and licenses to construct and operate radio stations; assigns broadcast frequencies; determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of station licenses; regulates transmission equipment, operating power, and other technical parameters of stations; adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation and employment practices of stations; regulates the content of some forms of radio broadcast programming; and has the authority under the Communications Act to impose penalties for violations of its rules.
The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act, and related FCC rules and policies (collectively, the "Communications Laws"). This description does not purport to be comprehensive, and reference should be made to the Communications Laws, public notices, and decisions issued by the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio broadcast stations. Failure to observe the provisions of the Communications Laws can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures and the grant of a "short-term" (less than the maximum term) license renewal. For particularly egregious violations, the FCC may deny a station's license renewal application, revoke a station's license, or deny applications in which an applicant seeks to acquire additional broadcast properties.
License Grant and Renewal
Radio broadcast licenses are generally granted and renewed for terms of up to eight years at a time. Licenses are renewed by filing an application with the FCC, which is subject to review and approval. The Communications Act expressly provides that a radio station is authorized to continue to operate after the expiration date of its existing license until the FCC acts on a pending renewal application. Petitions to deny license renewal applications may be filed by interested parties, including members of the public. The most recent renewal cycle for radio licenses began in June 2019 and will conclude in April 2022. While we have historically been able to renew our licenses, there can be no assurance that all of our licenses will be renewed in the future for a full term, or at all. Our inability to renew a significant portion of our radio broadcast licenses could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Service Areas
The area served by an AM station is determined by a combination of frequency, transmitter power, antenna orientation, and soil conductivity. To determine the effective service area of an AM station, the station's power, operating frequency, antenna patterns and its day/night operating modes are evaluated. The area served by an FM station is determined by a combination of effective radiated power ("ERP"), antenna height and terrain, with stations divided into eight classes according to these technical parameters.
Each class of FM radio station has the right to broadcast with a certain amount of ERP from an antenna located at a certain height above average terrain. The most powerful FM radio stations, which are generally those with the largest geographic reach, are Class C FM stations, which operate with up to the equivalent of 100 kilowatts ("kW") of ERP at an antenna height of 1,968 feet above average terrain. These stations typically provide service to a large area that covers one or more counties (which may or may not be in the same state). There are also Class C0, C1, C2 and C3 FM radio stations which operate with progressively less power and/or antenna height above average terrain and, thus, less geographic reach. In addition, Class B FM stations operate with the equivalent of up to 50 kW ERP at an antenna height of 492 feet above average terrain. Class B stations can serve large metropolitan areas and their outer suburban areas. Class B1 stations can operate with up to the equivalent of 25 kW ERP at an antenna height of 328 feet above average terrain. Class A FM stations operate with up to the equivalent of 6 kW ERP at an antenna height of 328 feet above average terrain, and often serve smaller cities or suburbs of larger cities.
The following table sets forth, as of February 16, 2022, by market, the number of all our owned and operated stations, 
including stations operated under an LMA, whether or not pending acquisition, and all other announced pending station acquisitions, if any.

Regulatory Approvals
The Communications Laws prohibit the assignment or transfer of control of a broadcast license without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant an application for assignment or transfer of control of a broadcast license, the Communications Act requires the FCC to find that the assignment or transfer would serve the public interest. The FCC considers a number of factors in making this determination, including (1) compliance with various rules limiting common ownership or control of radio stations, (2) the financial and "character" qualifications of the assignee or transferee (including those parties holding an "attributable" interest in the assignee or transferee), (3) compliance with the Communications Act's foreign ownership restrictions, and (4) compliance with other Communications Laws, including those related to programming and filing requirements. As discussed in greater detail below, the FCC may also review the effect of proposed assignments and transfers of broadcast licenses on economic competition and diversity. See "Antitrust and Market Concentration Considerations" within Item 1, "Business."
In connection with our 2011 acquisition of Citadel Broadcasting Corporation and our emergence from Chapter 11 in June 2018, we were required to place certain stations into two divestiture trusts in compliance with the FCC rules. The trust 
agreements stipulated that we must fund any operating shortfalls from the activities of the stations in the trusts, and any excess cash flow generated by such stations will be distributed to us until the stations are sold. As of February 16, 2022, there are two stations remaining in those trusts.
Ownership Matters
The Communications Act generally restricts companies which control broadcast licenses from having more than 25% of their capital stock owned or voted by non-U.S. persons, foreign governments or non-U.S. corporations. We filed a petition for declaratory ruling with the FCC in July 2018 requesting that we be permitted to have 100% foreign ownership generally. In May 2020, the Commission granted that petition allowing us to have 100% foreign voting and/or equity ownership, subject to certain conditions. We are required to take steps to monitor the citizenship of our stockholders based principally on our review of ownership information that is known or reasonably should be known to us to establish a reasonable basis for certifying compliance with the foreign ownership restrictions of the Communications Act. 
The Communications Laws also generally restrict the number of radio stations one person or entity may own, operate or control in a local market. In December 2018, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to launch its 2018 quadrennial review of multiple ownership rules. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking does not make any specific proposals but seeks comment regarding whether its local radio ownership rule limits should be modified. In June 2021, the FCC requested further comment to update the record in the 2018 quadrennial review. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt changes to the local radio ownership rule or what impact any such changes would have on our holdings.
To our knowledge, these multiple ownership rules do not require any change in our current ownership of radio broadcast radio stations. The Communications Laws limit the number of additional stations that we may acquire in the future in our existing markets as well as any new markets. 
Because of these multiple and cross-ownership rules, a purchaser of our voting stock who acquires an "attributable" interest in Cumulus (as discussed below) may violate the Communications Laws if such purchaser also has an attributable interest in other broadcast stations, depending on the number and location of those stations. Such purchaser may also be restricted in the companies in which it may invest to the extent that those investments give rise to an attributable interest. If one of our stockholders with an attributable interest violates any of these ownership rules, we may be unable to obtain one or more authorizations from the FCC needed to conduct our radio station business and may be unable to obtain FCC consents for certain future acquisitions.
The FCC generally applies its multiple ownership rules by considering the "attributable" interests held by a person or entity. With some exceptions, a person or entity will be deemed to hold an attributable interest in a broadcast station if the person or entity serves as an officer, director, partner, stockholder, member, or, in certain cases, a debt holder of a company that owns that station. If an interest is attributable, the FCC treats the person or entity that holds that interest as the "owner" of the station in question, and, thus, that interest is attributed to the person in determining compliance with the FCC's ownership rules.
With respect to a corporation, officers, directors and persons or entities that directly or indirectly hold 5% or more of the corporation's voting stock (20% or more of such stock in the case of insurance companies, investment companies, bank trust departments and certain other "passive investors" that hold such stock for investment purposes only) generally are attributed with ownership of the media outlets owned by the corporation. As discussed below, participation in an LMA or a Joint Sales Agreement ("JSA") also may result in an attributable interest. See "Local Marketing Agreements" and "Joint Sales Agreements" within Item 1, "Business."
With respect to a partnership (or limited liability company), the interest of a general partner (or managing member) is attributable. The following interests generally are not attributable: (1) debt instruments, non-voting stock, and options and warrants for voting stock, partnership interests or membership interests that have not yet been exercised; (2) limited partnership or limited liability company membership interests where (a) the limited partner or member is not "materially involved" in the media-related activities of the partnership or limited liability company, and (b) the limited partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement expressly "insulates" the limited partner or member from such material involvement by inclusion of specific provisions; and (3) holdings of less than 5% of a corporation's voting stock, unless in any such case stock or other equity holdings, whether voting or non-voting and whether insulated or not, and/or debt interests, collectively constitute more than 33% of a broadcast station's "enterprise value," which consists of the total equity and debt capitalization, and the non-voting stockholder or equity-holder/debt holder has an attributable interest in another station in the same market or supplies more than 15% of the programming of the station owned by the entity in which such holder holds such stock, equity or debt interests).
Programming and Operation
The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the "public interest." To satisfy that obligation broadcasters are required by FCC rules and policies to present programming that is responsive to community problems, needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness. FCC rules require that each radio broadcaster place a list in its public inspection file at the end of each quarter that identifies important community issues and the programs the radio broadcaster used in the prior quarter to address those issues. Radio station public inspection files are maintained on the FCC's publicly-accessible online database, and station licensees are required to upload required information to their respective files. 
Complaints from listeners concerning a station's programming may be filed at any time and will be considered by the FCC both at the time they are filed and in connection with a licensee's renewal application. FCC rules also require broadcasters to provide equal employment opportunities ("EEO") in the hiring of personnel, to abide by certain procedures in advertising employment opportunities, to make information available on employment opportunities on their website (if they have one), and maintain certain records concerning their compliance with EEO rules. The FCC will entertain individual complaints concerning a broadcast licensee's failure to abide by the EEO rules and also conducts random audits on broadcast licensees' compliance with EEO rules. We have been subject to numerous EEO audits. To date, none of those audits has disclosed any major violation that would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition or operations. Stations also must follow provisions in the Communications Laws that regulate a variety of other activities, including political advertising, the broadcast of obscene or indecent programming, sponsorship identification, the broadcast of contests and lotteries, and technical operations (including limits on radio frequency radiation). 
We are and have been subject to listener complaints and FCC enforcement actions from time to time on a variety of matters. While none of them have had a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition or operations as a whole to date, we cannot predict whether any future complaint or action might have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition or operations.
Local Marketing Agreements
From time to time, radio stations enter into LMAs. In a typical LMA, the licensee of a station makes available, for a fee and reimbursement of its expenses, airtime on its station to a party which supplies programming to be broadcast during that airtime, and collects revenues from advertising aired during such programming. LMAs are subject to compliance with the antitrust laws and the Communications Laws, including the requirement that the licensee must maintain independent control over the station and, in particular, its personnel, programming, and finances. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company operated one radio station under LMA. 
A station that brokers more than 15% of the weekly programming hours on another station in its market will be considered to have an attributable ownership interest in the brokered station for purposes of the FCC's ownership rules. As a result, a radio station may not enter into an LMA that allows it to program more than 15% of the weekly programming hours of another station in the same market that it could not own under the FCC's multiple ownership rules.
Joint Sales Agreements
From time to time, radio stations enter into JSAs. A typical JSA authorizes one party or station to sell another station's advertising time and retain the revenue from the sale of that airtime in exchange for a periodic payment to the station whose airtime is being sold (which may include a share of the revenue collected from the sale of airtime). Like LMAs, JSAs are subject to compliance with antitrust laws and the Communications Laws, including the requirement that the licensee must maintain independent control over the station and, in particular, its personnel, programming, and finances.
Under the FCC's ownership rules, a radio station that sells more than 15% of the weekly advertising time of another radio station in the same market will be attributed with the ownership of that other station. For that reason, a radio station cannot have a JSA with another radio station in the same market if the FCC's ownership rules would otherwise prohibit that common ownership. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company does not operate under any JSAs. 
Content, Licenses and Royalties
We must pay royalties to song composers and publishers whenever we broadcast musical compositions. Such copyright owners of musical compositions most often rely on intermediaries known as performing rights organizations ("PROs") to negotiate licenses with copyright users for the public performance of their compositions, collect royalties under such licenses and distribute them to copyright owners. We have obtained public performance licenses from, and pay license fees to, the three major PROs in the U.S., which are the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers ("ASCAP"), 
Broadcast Music, Inc. ("BMI") and SESAC, Inc. ("SESAC"). There is no guarantee that a given songwriter or publisher will remain associated with ASCAP, BMI or SESAC or that additional PROs will not emerge. 
In 2013, a new PRO was formed named Global Music Rights ("GMR"). GMR has secured the rights to certain copyrights and is seeking to negotiate individual licensing agreements with radio stations for songs in its repertoire. GMR and the Radio Music License Committee, Inc. ("RMLC"), which negotiates music licensing fees with PROs on behalf of many U.S. radio stations, instituted antitrust litigation against one another. During the pendency of the litigation, the Company accessed GMR’s library of songs through an interim license, and subsequently entered into a long-term license agreement with GMR in July 2021. In January 2022, RMLC and GMR reached a conditional settlement of the litigation. Under that settlement, GMR offered radio stations which have not otherwise entered into a long-term agreement with GMR the opportunity to enter into a long-term license agreement as negotiated by the RMLC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the withdrawal of a significant number of musical composition copyright owners from the three established PROs, the emergence of one or more additional PROs in the future, could impact, and in some circumstances increase, our royalty rates and negotiation costs.
Antitrust and Market Concentration Considerations
From time to time, Congress and the FCC have considered, and may in the future consider and adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operation, ownership or profitability of our radio stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our radio stations, or affect our ability to acquire additional radio stations or finance such acquisitions.
Potential future acquisitions, to the extent they meet specified size thresholds, will be subject to applicable waiting periods and possible review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (the "HSR Act"), by the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") or the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), either of which can be required to, or can otherwise decide to, evaluate a transaction to determine whether that transaction should be challenged under the federal antitrust laws. Transactions generally are subject to the HSR Act if the acquisition price or fair market value of the stations to be acquired is $92 million or more; however, the FTC recently announced an increase to the HSR size-of-transaction threshold to $101 million, which will become effective on February 23, 2022. Acquisitions that are not required to be reported under the HSR Act may still be investigated by the DOJ or the FTC under the antitrust laws before or after consummation. At any time before or after the consummation of a proposed acquisition, the DOJ or the FTC could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary, including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or seeking divestiture of the business acquired or certain of our other assets. The DOJ has reviewed numerous potential radio station acquisitions where an operator proposed to acquire additional stations in its existing markets or multiple stations in new markets, and has challenged a number of such transactions. Some of these challenges have resulted in consent decrees requiring the sale of certain stations, the termination of LMAs or other relief. In general, the DOJ has more closely scrutinized radio mergers and acquisitions resulting in local market shares in excess of 35% of local radio advertising revenues, depending on format, signal strength and other factors. There is no precise numerical rule, however, and certain transactions resulting in more than 35% revenue shares have not been challenged, while certain other transactions may be challenged based on other criteria such as audience shares in one or more demographic groups as well as the percentage of revenue share. We estimate that we have more than a 35% share of radio advertising revenues in many of our markets.
We are aware that the DOJ commenced, and subsequently discontinued, investigations of several of our prior transactions. The DOJ can be expected to continue to enforce the antitrust laws in this manner, and there can be no assurance that future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of an investigation or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC. Similarly, there can be no assurance that the DOJ, FTC or FCC will not prohibit such mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, require that they be restructured, or in appropriate cases, require that we divest stations we already own in a particular market or divest specific lines of business. In addition, private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge a merger, acquisition or divestiture under the antitrust laws.
As part of its review of certain radio station acquisitions, the DOJ has stated publicly that it believes that commencement of operations under LMAs, JSAs and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station ownership assignments and transfers prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act could violate the HSR Act. In connection with acquisitions subject to the waiting period under the HSR Act, we will not commence operation of any affected station to be acquired under a LMA, a JSA, or similar agreement until the waiting period has expired or been terminated.
No assurances can be provided that actual, threatened or possible future DOJ or FTC action in connection with potential transactions would not have a material adverse effect on our ability to enter into or consummate various transactions, or operate any acquired stations at any time in the future.
