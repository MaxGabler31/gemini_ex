Overview
 Cherokee Global Brands is a global marketer and manager of a portfolio of fashion and lifestyle brands that we own, brands that we create, and brands that we develop for others.  Company-owned brands, which are licensed in multiple consumer product categories and retail tiers around the world, include Cherokee, Hi-Tec, Magnum, 50 Peaks, Interceptor, Hawk Signature, Tony Hawk, Liz Lange, Completely Me by Liz Lange, Everyday California, Carole Little, Sideout and others.  As part of our business strategy, we also regularly evaluate other brands and trademarks for acquisition into our portfolio.  We believe the strength of our brand portfolio and platform of design, product development and marketing capabilities has made us one of the leading global licensors of style-focused lifestyle brands for apparel, footwear, accessories and home products. 
 We have licensing relationships with recognizable retail partners in their global locations to provide them with the rights to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands, and we also have licensing relationships with manufacturers and distributors for the manufacture and sale of products bearing our brands. As a brand marketer and manager, we do not directly sell product ourselves.  Rather, we earn royalties when our licensees sell licensed products bearing the trademarks that we own, or when they sell products that we have designed and developed.
 We provide our licensees with access to our proprietary 360-degree platform and believe that our brand marketing and media outreach, product design and development capabilities, and growth strategies and tactics have allowed Cherokee Global Brands to address the growing power of the consumer and the present and future needs of our wholesale and retail business partners and licensees.  Based on consumer research, retail insights and brand insights that we continually measure, evaluate and incorporate into our 360-degree platform, we believe Cherokee Global Brands has become a key strategic partner to our licensees.  We believe our licensing partners rely on our vision, which defines the growth potential and trajectories of our brands, the agility we afford to them through our 360-degree platform, which is designed to quickly seize opportunities and integrate new innovations, and the opportunity to realize global, multi-channel, multi-category scale through our portfolio of lifestyle brands and our platform capabilities.  As of February 2, 2019, we had 46 continuing license agreements in approximately 80 countries.  These arrangements include relationships with Walmart, Soriana, Comercial Mexicana, TJ Maxx, Tottus, Pick N Pay, Nishimatsuya, Big 5, Academy, JD Sports, Black’s and Lidl, in addition to regional distributors.
 Licensing and Other Selling Models
 Direct to Retail
 In Direct to Retail licensing, or “DTR” licensing, we grant retailers a “territory” or “channel-specific” license to use our trademarks on certain categories of merchandise.  We collaborate with our licensees’ product development staff and merchandisers on design direction, packaging, marketing and other aspects pertaining to the products sold with our trademarks, and in some cases our licensees modify or expand the designs or create their own designs to suit their seasonal, regional and category needs.  In several cases, the licensee is responsible for designing and manufacturing the merchandise, although many products are subject to our pre‑approved packaging, graphics and quality control standards and many of our licensees’ marketing campaigns are subject to similar oversight.  We plan to continue to solicit new licensees using our DTR licensing model in new territories and additional product categories as we seek to expand this part of our business.
 We believe that the DTR licensing model generally offers each licensee, or retailer, the exclusive right to market multiple categories of products with a recognized brand within their territory, thereby offering licensees the ability to enhance their marketing strategies and achieve a competitive advantage over competing retailers.  This differentiation can also provide the retailer/licensee an opportunity to command a “premium” for our brand offering over private label price points, which can result in increased profit margins for the licensee, even after royalties have been paid to the licensor.  The licensees generally directly source their own inventory, thereby eliminating the licensor’s exposure to inventory and manufacturing risk while allowing the licensees to benefit from large economies of scale.
 Many of the world’s largest retailers have successfully introduced, and continue to introduce, new brands based on the DTR licensing model.  Examples of retailers participating in the DTR licensing model include Walmart, Carrefour, Lidl and C&A, among others.

Our DTR licensing strategy is premised on the proposition that, for many retailers worldwide, most aspects of the moderately priced apparel, accessory, footwear and home categories, including product development, design, merchandising, sourcing and distribution, can be executed most effectively by these retailers themselves, who typically command significant economies of scale, but also interact daily with their end consumers.  We believe many of these retailers may be able to obtain higher gross margins on sales and increase store traffic by sourcing, stocking and selling licensed products bearing widely recognized brand names (such as our brands) than by carrying only private label goods or by carrying only branded products obtained from third‑party vendors.  We also believe many retailers may be able to achieve enhanced profitability with our DTR licensing model because it allows them to avoid the substantial marketing costs associated with establishing and maintaining an in‑store brand.
 Wholesale
 We also license our brands to manufacturers and distributors based on wholesale arrangements.  Wholesale licensing arrangements generally involve licensing to manufacturers and distributors that produce and/or import various categories of apparel, accessories, footwear and home products under our trademarks and trademarks owned by third parties and sell the licensed products to retailers, which then resell the products to consumers.
 Although our strategy has historically been focused primarily on the DTR licensing model, we have some historical wholesale licensees with respect to some of our brands, and we have recently entered into several new wholesale arrangements for the Cherokee, Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk and Liz Lange brands.  In addition, we are primarily pursuing a wholesale licensing strategy for global sales of our recently acquired Hi-Tec, Magnum, 50 Peaks and Interceptor brands.  We believe these arrangements signal a significant shift in our business strategy, from our historical focus on DTR licensing for all of our brands to a substantially greater focus on wholesale licensing for many of our key brands.  We believe these wholesale licensing arrangements may help to diversify our sources of revenue and licensee or other partner relationships and may provide additional avenues to obtain brand recognition and grow our Company, including an opportunity to further expand the reach of our brands in markets where a DTR licensing model may not be the most effective approach.
 Design Services
 We provide product design and development services for retailers that prefer to sell brands that they own.  We believe that our 360-degree platform provides the key ingredients for retailers to efficiently produce product ranges that are tailored for their target consumers and the retailers’ specific business needs.  Our retail partners can rely on our product development and design capabilities, which are supported by our retail and brand marketing abilities, focusing their resources instead on retail operations.  We expect that together this will lead to increased rates of sale, greater sell-through and improved retail performance. 
Brand Portfolio
 Cherokee
 Cherokee is an iconic, American family‑lifestyle brand, offering classic, casual and comfortable products at affordable prices.  Cherokee, which was initially launched as a footwear line in 1973, seeks to produce timeless classics, inspired by vintage Americana while continually being updated to account for modern trends.  After four decades, the Cherokee brand stands for confident, effortless and relaxed American style.  We believe this heritage positions the Cherokee brand for future growth and further international expansion.  Additional categories of Cherokee branded products are sold internationally, including adult apparel, home décor, textiles, outdoor furnishings and camping gear.
 Royalty revenues from global sales of Cherokee branded products were $9.7 and $11.1 million in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively, which accounted for 40% and 38% of our total royalty revenues in these years.  Historically, the Cherokee brand’s most significant licensee was Target Corporation (“Target”), which licensed the Cherokee brand almost two decades ago and had exclusive rights in the United States to its multi‑category product offering that encompassed kid’s apparel, accessories, footwear and school uniforms.  We do not currently have license agreements with Target after our license agreement covering sales of Cherokee branded products in the school uniforms category expired on January 31, 2018.  Beginning in Fiscal 2018, a variety of categories of products bearing the Cherokee brand are being distributed to retailers in the United States by multiple wholesale distributors under new license agreements we have established with these distributors.  The categories cover a wide range of Cherokee products, including casual sportswear, sweaters and outerwear in the men’s and boys’ categories, various products in the infant and toddler categories, active wear, sportswear, dresses, denim and sweaters in the girl’s category, and swimwear and sleepwear.  We also have other licensees for the Cherokee brand in various countries and territories around the world.

Hi-Tec, Magnum, 50 Peaks and Interceptor
 Founded in 1974 and based in the Netherlands, the Hi-Tec footwear brand seeks to produce quality shoes for a fair price that are “comfortable anywhere”.  Hi-Tec is known for its comfortable and lightweight hiking and walking shoes, and also produces technical outdoor footwear and various other types of shoes.  The Hi-Tec brand is one of the world’s leaders in sports and outdoor footwear.  Magnum produces work boot footwear, specific-purpose tactical boots and uniform footwear.  50 Peaks is a high spec, technical outdoor footwear brand that was born out of the accomplishments of adventurer Adrian Crane, who climbed the 50 highest peaks in each of the 50 states in the USA in a record time of 101 days.  Interceptor is a tactical footwear brand sold throughout the world.  These footwear brands are sold predominately in the United Kingdom, continental Europe, the United States, Canada, South Africa, South and Central America and Asia.  The Interceptor brand is currently sold at Walmart U.S. 
 We acquired the Hi-Tec, Magnum, 50 Peaks and Interceptor brands in December 2016 in a transaction we refer to as the “Hi-Tec Acquisition”.  Before the acquisition, these brands were owned and operated under a distribution model whereby the products bearing these brands were designed, contracted for manufacture, sold and distributed by the brand owner through retailers, independent distributors, licensees, government contracts and directly to consumers via e-commerce.  We acquired the Hi-Tec brands with the objective of converting these operations to a brand licensing model that aligns with our operations.  To accomplish this objective, we have sold all of the former sales and distribution operations for the Hi-Tec brands to third parties and entered into new wholesale licensing arrangements with these third parties, and we have retained all of the intellectual property for the Hi-Tec brands.  We believe this brand licensing model conversion will allow us to better access the markets we think are best addressed by the Hi-Tec brands, more efficiently leverage cross-selling opportunities with our other brands, and more effectively expand the Hi-Tec brands into other product categories, such as apparel and accessories.  Royalty revenues from global sales of Hi-Tec, Magnum, 50 Peaks and Interceptor branded products were $11.6 and $9.7 million in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively, which accounted for 47% and 33% of our total royalty revenues in these years.  
 Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk
 Tony Hawk is among the most well‑known athletes in skateboarding history and is the founder of the Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk apparel lines.  The Tony Hawk brand is designed for comfort, flexibility and durability and it embodies the “skate culture” lifestyle, combining style with performance.  The Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk brands have expanded our presence in the department store and specialty channels of distribution.
 Royalty revenues from global sales of Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk branded products were $0.6 million and $5.5 million in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively, which accounted for 3% and 19% of our total royalty revenues in those years. Since our acquisition of these brands in January 2014, their most significant licensee has been Kohl’s Illinois, Inc. (“Kohl’s”), which had exclusive rights to sell apparel bearing these brands in various specified categories of merchandise in the United States through July 2017, after which the rights became non-exclusive until the expiration of our license agreement with Kohl’s covering these brands on January 31, 2018.  Beginning in the third quarter of Fiscal 2018 when Kohl’s rights became non-exclusive, products bearing these brands are being distributed to a variety of retailers in the United States, including specialty, mid-tier, regional, mass market, off-price and club stores, by several wholesale distributors under new license agreements we have established with these distributors. In addition, we have separate wholesale and DTR license agreements with others to supply Hawk Signature and Tony Hawk apparel in Canada, Latin America and throughout Europe.
 Liz Lange 
 Liz Lange has gained wide acceptance as a modern “maternity and beyond” designer brand that brings women versatile, comfortable, affordable and flattering style for every stage of pregnancy.  Liz Lange maternity apparel debuted in over 1,500 Target stores in the United States in 2002 and was sold exclusively in Target stores in the United States until the expiration of our license agreement with Target covering this brand on January 31, 2018.  Beginning in Fiscal 2019, these products have started to be distributed by a wholesale distributor to various retailers in the United States under a master license agreement we have established with the distributor.

Everyday California
 Crafted in Southern California, Everyday California is designed to embody the California spirit and celebrate living life to the fullest.  From California’s snowcapped mountains to its sandy shores, Everyday California apparel and accessories for men and women are the perfect match for any journey.  Everyday California was born out of a desire to share the California state of mind and the notion that adventure is just around the corner.   We acquired the Everyday California brand in May 2015.
 Point Cove
 Point Cove was created in-house by Cherokee Global Brands' design team in close collaboration with Reliance Trends, a chain of retail stores in India.  The brand was launched in September 2015 and brings a combination of playfulness and sophistication to Reliance Trends stores in key categories, including apparel, accessories and footwear, for kids ages 2-14.  The collection features bold colors that bring the California spirit to India.
Carole Little
 Carole Little was founded in 1975 by designer Carole Little through her love for contemporary clothing.  The Carole Little brand became recognized for colorful and unusual prints, soft two‑piece outfits and dresses, and has an ageless, independent attitude for the self‑confident woman.
Sideout
 Conceived in 1983 by a California volleyball player, the Sideout brand took root at the beach, harnessing the easy spirit of a casual California lifestyle.  Ideal for a game of beach volleyball or a breezy vacation, Sideout products perform in quality, functionality and originality by offering casual, hip and cool clothing, footwear and accessories at affordable prices.
Royalties and Other Revenues
 Our rights to receive royalties for sales of products bearing our brands or products we have developed and designed are set forth in the terms of our license agreements with various retailers and wholesalers.  The royalty rates we receive from our licensees vary depending on the terms of each licensing agreement.  Generally, our DTR license agreements include royalty rates based on a percentage of the retailer’s sales of licensed products.  Some of our DTR license agreements provide for fixed royalty rates, and other DTR license agreements provide for royalty rates that may decrease or otherwise fluctuate during a year as the retailer achieves sales volume thresholds.  For wholesale license agreements, royalty rates are generally based on a fixed percentage of wholesale sales from the wholesaler to the retailer or a fixed percentage of manufacturing costs.
 In some cases, we require the licensee to guarantee a minimum royalty payment to us each year, although the amount of this minimum payment can vary significantly from licensee to licensee and is typically lower for wholesale licensees than for DTR licensees.  We no longer have a significant concentration of fixed minimum payments in any one licensee.  As of February 2, 2019, we had contractual rights to receive over $60.7 million forward‑facing minimum royalty revenues over the next ten years, excluding any revenues that may be guaranteed in connection with future contract renewals.
 Royalties are generally paid within 30 days after a quarterly selling period as defined in the applicable license agreement.  To ensure our licensees are reporting and calculating the appropriate royalties, all of our license agreements grant us the right to audit our licensees’ royalty reports to validate the amount of sales or purchases reported and royalties paid.
 Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property Rights
 We hold various trademarks, including Cherokee®, Hi-Tec®, Magnum®, 50 Peaks ® , Interceptor ® , Hawk Signature®, Tony Hawk®, Liz Lange®, Completely Me by Liz Lange®, Everyday California®, Carole Little®, Saint Tropez-West®, Chorus Line®, All That Jazz®, Sideout®, Sideout Sport® and others for numerous categories of apparel and other goods.  These trademarks are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and we also hold trademarks or trademark applications for each of these brand names and others with similar government agencies in a number of other countries.  Our trademark registrations typically expire after seven to ten years depending on the jurisdiction, although we intend, and expect to be able, to renew these trademarks for as long as we continue to use them.  Our business is dependent on our trademarks, and we monitor unauthorized uses of these trademarks on an ongoing basis.  In addition to trademarks, we also rely on know‑how, trade secrets and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights domestically and internationally.

Competition
 Merchandise bearing our brand names and goods that we have developed and are subject to intense competition.  Competing brands with respect to our Cherokee brand include Polo Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, and private label brands (developed by retailers) such as Faded Glory, Arizona and Route 66, and competing brands with respect to the Hi-Tec and Magnum brands include Columbia, Merrell, Keen, North Face, Timberland, Bates, Wolverine and other private label brands.  Our other brands also face competition from these and other numerous brands.  Factors that shape the competitive environment for our brands include quality of garment or accessory construction and design, brand name, style and color selection, price, fashion and other trends, avenue of purchase (including in stores and online), and the manufacturer’s ability to respond quickly to retailer and consumer demand.
 Our business plan focuses on creating strategic alliances with major retailers and wholesalers for their sale of products bearing our brands or products that we have developed and designed.  We license our trademarks directly to retailers, and we engage wholesalers to manufacture and distribute products bearing our brands and sell these products to retailers.  We also develop and design products for retailers that prefer to sell products bearing their own brand names.  Therefore, our degree of success is dependent on the strength of our brands, consumer acceptance of our brands, our licensees’ ability to design, manufacture and sell products bearing our brands and our licensees’ ability to sell products we have developed and designed, all of which is dependent on the ability of us and our licensees to respond to ever-changing consumer demands.  In addition, we compete with companies that own other brands and trademarks, as these companies could enter into similar licensing arrangements with retailers and wholesalers in the United States and internationally.  These arrangements could be with our existing retail and wholesale partners, thereby competing with us for consumer attention and limited floor or rack space in the same stores in which our branded products are sold, and vying with us for the time and resources of the retailers and wholesale licensees that manufacture and distribute our products.
 Seasonality
 Our business and performance do not reflect significant seasonality trends.  However, to the extent royalty revenues grow from our new wholesale licensees, we expect our revenues may shift toward the latter half of our fiscal year, which would be consistent with the normal, holiday-based seasonal pattern of retail sales.
Government Regulations
 Our business practices in international markets are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and any applicable foreign anti-bribery laws.  We are also subject to various laws that are generally applicable to businesses in our industry, such as work safety and labor laws that govern certain of our operations and our employee relations.  Our violation of any of these laws could subject us to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Employees
 As of February 2, 2019, we employed 43 persons.  None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
 Financial Information about Geographic Areas
 Approximately 75% and 55% of our revenues were derived from our international licensees in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively, and we face risks related to these foreign operations.  See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for information about these risks, and see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for certain financial information by geographic area.
