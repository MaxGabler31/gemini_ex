ITEM 1—BUSINESS
General
 In this Annual Report, when we refer to “Huttig,” the “Company,” “we” or “us,” we mean Huttig Building Products, Inc. and its subsidiary unless the context indicates otherwise.
 Huttig Building Products, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1913, was founded in 1885 and is a leading domestic distributor of millwork, building materials and wood products used principally in new residential construction and in-home improvement, remodeling and repair work. We purchase from leading manufacturers and distribute our products through 27 wholesale distribution centers serving 41 states. Our distribution centers sell principally to building materials dealers, national buying groups, home centers and industrial users, including makers of manufactured homes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated net sales of $839.6 million.
 We conduct our business through a two-step distribution model. This means we purchase from manufacturers and resell the products to our customers, who then sell the products to end users, who are typically professional builders and independent contractors engaged in residential construction and remodeling projects, or consumers engaged in do-it-yourself remodeling projects.
 Our products fall into three categories: (i) millwork, which includes doors, windows, moulding, stair parts and columns, (ii) general building products, which include connectors, fasteners, composite decking, housewrap, roofing products and insulation, and (iii) wood products, which include engineered wood products, such as flooring systems, as well as wood panels and lumber.
 Doors and engineered wood products often require our value-added service before they are delivered to our customers. Such services include pre-finishing exterior door units, pre-hanging exterior and interior door units and cutting engineered wood products from standard lengths to job-specific requirements. In addition, with respect to the majority of our products, we have the capability to buy in bulk and disaggregate these large shipments to meet individual customer stocking requirements. For some products, we carry a depth and breadth of products that our customers and vendors cannot reasonably stock themselves. Likewise, our vendors benefit from our broad geographic footprint of distribution centers enabling them to supply a broader breadth of products and cost-effectively reach a greater number of end users.  Many of the value-added services we provide are highly customized and cannot be provided effectively by our vendors. In addition, our sales force extends our vendors’ effective coverage area and knowledge of regional trends. Our customers benefit from our business capabilities because they do not need to invest capital in door hanging facilities or cutting equipment, nor do they need to incur the costs associated with maintaining large inventories of products. Our size, broad geographic presence, extensive fleet and logistical capabilities often enable us to purchase products in large volumes at favorable prices, stock a diverse range of products for rapid delivery and manage inventory in a reliable, efficient manner.
 We serve our customers, whether they are a local dealer or national account, through our 27 wholesale distribution centers. Our broad geographic footprint enables us to work with our customers and suppliers to ensure that local inventory levels, merchandising, purchasing and pricing are tailored to the requirements of each market. Each distribution center also has access to our single-platform nationwide inventory management system. This provides the local manager with real-time inventory availability and pricing information. We support our distribution centers with credit and financial management, training and marketing programs and human resources expertise. We believe that these distribution capabilities and efficiencies provide us a competitive advantage that allows us to deliver quality products in a timely manner and allow for the efficient operation of our customers’ and vendors’ supply chain, as compared to many local and regional competitors.
 Industry Characteristics and Trends
 The residential building materials distribution industry is characterized by its substantial size, a highly fragmented ownership structure and an increasingly competitive environment. The industry serves two market categories: (i) new construction and (ii) home improvement, repair and remodeling.
 -4-


Residential construction activity in both categories is closely linked to a variety of factors directly affected by general economic conditions, including employment levels, job and household formation, interest rates, housing prices, housing inventory, tax policy, availability of mortgage financing, prices of commodity wood and steel products, immigration patterns, regional demographics and consumer confidence.  We monitor a broad set of macroeconomic and regional indicators, including new housing starts and permit issuances, as indicators of our potential future sales volume.
 New housing activity in the United States has shown modest improvement each year since 2009, the trough period of the housing downturn.  However, 2018 activity was still below the Historical Average of total housing starts of approximately 1.4 million. Total new housing starts in the United States were approximately 1.2 million, 1.2 million and 1.2 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Total new single family housing starts were 0.9 million, 0.8 million and 0.8 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau. 
 We service large local, regional and national independent building products dealers, specialty dealers, and home centers who in turn sell to contractors, professional builders, and consumers. These large local, regional and national building products dealers often referred to as “pro dealers,” continue to distribute a significant portion of the residential building materials sold in the United States. These pro dealers operate in an increasingly competitive environment. Consolidation among building products manufacturers favors distributors that can buy in bulk and break down large production runs to specific local requirements. In addition, increasing scale and sophistication among professional builders and contractors places a premium on pro dealers that can make a wide variety of building products readily available at competitive prices. In response to the increasingly competitive environment for building products, many pro dealers have either consolidated or formed buying groups in order to increase their purchasing power and/or service levels.  
 We service national home centers through special order programs of branded products in both millwork and building products. These programs continue to grow each year, as manufacturers develop special order programs for these retailers and utilize our value-added service model and broad distribution network to support the programs locally.
 We believe the evolving characteristics of the residential building materials distribution industry, particularly the consolidation trend, favor companies like us that operate nationally and have significant infrastructure in place to accommodate the needs of customers across geographic regions. We believe we are the only national distributor of millwork products. Our wide geographic presence, size, purchasing power, material handling efficiencies and investment in millwork services position us well to serve the needs of the consolidating pro dealer community.
 Strategic Initiatives
 Our strategy is to increase stockholder value through the growth and diversification of our business.  To accomplish this, we have developed strategic initiatives that require investments in our infrastructure, our people and technology platform.  Our goals are to accelerate our growth and diversify our business, which we believe will improve operating leverage over the intermediate term.
 To accelerate our growth and diversification, we have made strategic capital and operating investments to execute our product line expansion and market segment penetration organic growth initiatives.  The national expansion of our Huttig-Grip product line, which is sourced both domestically and internationally, expands the breadth and geographic coverage of our private label specialty building product lines. Through our investments in automated, high-capacity, pre-finish door lines and segment-focused sales resources, further penetration of the home improvement, repair and remodel market diversifies our business to be less dependent on new home construction, reinforces our position as the largest, value-add door fabricator to the professional residential construction market in the country, and accelerates our growth in higher value, and higher gross margin products.
 In addition to the above initiatives, we continue to invest in our organization to attract the best talent to achieve our goal of creating a top-performing, disciplined organization with talented, engaged, and empowered people. We also continue to invest in our technology platform to achieve improved operating efficiencies in the

functional areas of the business while delivering advanced customer interface technology to make Huttig the clear supplier of choice for the products we sell.
 Products
 We strive to offer products that allow us to provide value to our customers. We accomplish this by performing incremental services on the products before delivering them to customers, buying products in bulk and disaggregating them for individual customers, or carrying a broader depth and breadth of products that customers cannot reasonably stock themselves at each location. Our products can be classified into three main categories:

• | Millwork, including exterior and interior doors, pre-hung and factory-finished door units, windows, patio doors, mouldings, frames, stair parts and columns. Key brands in this product category include Therma-Tru, Masonite, Woodgrain, HB&G, Simpson Door, Final Frame, BrasPine, Arauco, Windsor Windows and Rogue Valley Door; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | General building products, such as fasteners and connectors, roofing, siding, insulation, flashing, housewrap, decking, railing and other miscellaneous building products. Key brands in this product category include Huttig-Grip, Louisiana Pacific, Simpson Strong-Tie, TimberTech, AZEK, RDI, GAF Roofing, Maibec, Knauf, GCP Technologies, Fiberon, Alpha Protech, MFM, Lomanco and Fortifiber; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wood products, including engineered wood used in floor systems, wood panels and lumber. The engineered wood product line offers us the ability to provide our customers with value-added services, such as floor system take-offs, cut-to-length packages and just-in-time, cross-dock delivery capabilities. As such, engineered wood is our primary focus within this category. Key brands in this product category include Louisiana Pacific and Rosboro.

 The following table shows the percentage of our net sales represented by our three main product categories for each of the prior three years. Changes in commodity pricing, products and unit volumes could affect our product mix on a year-to-year basis.
 
 
 | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
------------------+------+----+---+------+----+-----
Millwork | | 48 | % | | 51 | % | 51 | %
Building Products | | 43 | % | | 40 | % | 39 | %
Wood Products | | 9 | % | | 9 | % | 10 | %

Customers
 During 2018, we served approximately 3,600 customers, with one customer, Lumbermen’s Merchandising Corporation (“LMC”) accounting for 14% of our sales in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016. LMC is a buying group representing multiple building material dealers. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 43% of our total sales in 2018.
 Building materials pro dealers represent our single largest customer group. Within the pro dealer category, a large percentage of our sales are to national accounts, including buying groups. These are large pro dealers, or groups of pro dealers, that generally operate in more than one state or region. We also sell to short line specialty dealers that focus on specific segments of the building industry, national retail home centers, and manufactured housing. We believe that our size, which lets us purchase in bulk, achieve operating efficiencies, operate on a national scale, and offer competitive pricing, makes us well suited to service the various segments of the dealer community. Our sales to national accounts, including buying groups, were 49% in both 2018 and 2017 and 45% in 2016.
 Organization
 Huttig operates on a nationwide basis. Customer sales are conducted through 27 distribution centers serving 41 states. Administrative and executive management functions are centralized at our headquarters located in 
 -6-


St. Louis, Missouri.  We believe that this structure allows us to be in closer proximity to our customers, and serve them better, while being able to take advantage of certain efficiencies of scale that come from our size.
 Headquarter functions include those activities that can be shared across our full distribution platform. These include financial management, information technology, human resources, legal, international procurement, internal audit and treasury, along with corporate operations, marketing and product management groups.
 Operating responsibility resides with each distribution center’s general manager. The general manager is responsible for daily operations, including sales, purchasing, personnel and logistics. Each distribution center generally maintains its own sales, warehouse and logistic personnel supported by a small administrative team.
 Sales
 Sales responsibility principally lies with general managers at our distribution centers. The sales function is generally divided into two channels: outside sales and inside sales. Our outside field representatives make on-site calls to local and regional customers. Our inside sales people generally receive and enter orders from customers and support our outside sales function. In addition, we maintain a national account sales team to serve national customers. Our outside sales force is generally compensated by a base salary or draw plus commissions determined primarily on profit margin.
Distribution Strategy and Operations
 While we believe having a nationwide reach is critical, the local distribution center is still the principal focus of our operations, and we tailor our business to meet local demand and customer needs. We customize product selection, inventory levels, service offerings and prices to meet local market requirements. With the exception of one distribution center, we support this strategy through our single platform information technology system. This system provides real-time access to pricing, inventory availability and margin analysis.  This system provides product information both for that location and our entire network of distribution centers. More broadly, our sales force, in conjunction with our product management teams, works with our suppliers and customers to determine the appropriate mix, quantity and pricing of products suited to each local market.
 We purchased products from over 700 different suppliers in 2018. We generally negotiate with our major suppliers on a national basis to leverage our total volume purchasing power, which we believe provides us with an advantage over our locally-based competitors. The majority of our purchases are made from suppliers that offer payment discounts and volume-related incentive programs. Although we generally do not have exclusive distribution rights for our key products and we do not have long-term contracts with many of our suppliers, we believe our national footprint, buying power and distribution network make us an attractive distributor for many manufacturers. Moreover, our long operating history has allowed us to forge long-standing relationships with many of our key suppliers who rely on us as a critical part of their supply chain.
 We regularly evaluate opportunities to introduce new products. This is primarily driven by opportunities created by customer demand or market requirements. We have found that customers generally welcome a greater breadth of product offering as it can improve their purchasing and operating efficiencies by providing for “one stop” shopping. Similarly, selectively broadening our product offering enables us to drive additional products through our distribution system, thereby increasing the efficiency of our operations by better leveraging our existing infrastructure.  The benefit created by this operating leverage may be offset by the cost to establish the new product line, expand our facilities and purchase the inventory.  During 2018, we continued to focus on the growth of our Huttig-Grip private label construction fastener and specialty building product lines. We expanded the scope of our international sourcing activities for our private label products which offers the opportunity to increase margins, but the longer lead-times on internationally sourced products also generally require an increased investment in inventory. We also continued to invest in its automated, high-capacity pre-finish door lines and focused sales resources to continue to penetrate the home improvement, repair and remodel market.
 We focus on selling respected, brand name products. We believe that brand awareness is an important factor in building products purchasing decisions. We generally benefit from the quality, marketing initiatives and product 
 -7-


support provided by manufacturers of branded products. We also benefit from the positive attributes that customers typically equate with branded products.  Additionally, we market and offer certain products under our private label brands, including Huttig-Grip.  We believe that these products are attractive to our customers based on their quality and competitive pricing.
 Competition
 We compete with many local and regional building product distributors and, in certain markets and product categories, with national building product distributors. We distribute products for some manufacturers that also engage in direct sales.
 The principal factors on which we compete are pricing and product availability, service and delivery capabilities, ability to assist with problem solving, customer relationships, geographic coverage and breadth of product offerings.
 Our size and geographic coverage are advantageous in obtaining and retaining distribution rights for brand name products. Our size also permits us to attract experienced sales and service personnel and gives us the resources to provide company-wide sales, product and service training programs. By working closely with our customers and suppliers and utilizing our single information technology platform, we believe our distribution centers are well positioned to maintain appropriate inventory levels and to deliver completed orders on time.
 Seasonality, Market Conditions and Working Capital
 Various cyclical and seasonal factors, such as general economic conditions and weather, historically have caused our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period. Our size, extensive nationwide operating model, and the geographic diversity of our distribution centers to some extent mitigate our exposure to these cyclical and seasonal factors. These factors include levels of new construction, home improvement and remodeling activity, weather, interest rates and other local, regional and national economic conditions.
 Our results of operations are affected by new housing activity in the United States. In 2018, total housing starts increased approximately 4%, to 1.2 million, but were still below the Historical Average of approximately 1.4 million. Based on the current level of housing activity and industry forecasts, we expect new housing activity, will continue to increase, albeit at a more tepid pace in 2019, but we cannot be certain.
 We anticipate that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future. Our results in the first and fourth quarters are generally adversely affected by winter weather patterns in the Northeast, Midwest and Northwest regions of the United States, typically due to seasonal decreases in levels of construction activity in these areas. Because much of our overhead and expenses remain relatively fixed throughout the year, our operating profits also tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters. In addition, weather patterns, such as hurricane season in the Southeast region of the United States during the third and fourth quarters, can have an adverse impact on our results in a particular period.
 We depend on cash flow from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility to finance seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditures, the investment in our product lines, including Huttig-Grip, and any acquisitions that we may undertake. Typically, our working capital requirements are greatest in the second and third quarters, due to the seasonal nature of our business. The second and third quarters also tend to be our strongest operating quarters, largely due to more favorable weather throughout many of our markets compared to the first and fourth quarters. We typically generate cash from working capital reductions in the fourth quarter of the year and build working capital during the first quarter in preparation for our second and third quarters. We also maintain significant inventories to meet the rapid delivery requirements of our customers and to enable us to obtain favorable pricing, delivery and service terms with our suppliers. In 2018, our working capital was impacted significantly as we continued to invest in inventory related to the growth of our Huttig-Grip product line. We source our private label product internationally and domestically. Sourcing Huttig-Grip products internationally requires longer lead-times and higher inventory levels to ensure available supply, but it also provides the opportunity for higher margins.  At each of December 31, 2018 and 2017, inventories and accounts receivables constituted approximately 73% of our 
 -8-


total assets.  We also closely monitor operating expenses and inventory levels during seasonally affected periods and, to the extent possible, manage variable operating costs to minimize seasonal effects on our profitability.
 Credit
 Huttig maintains an overall credit policy for sales to customers and delegates responsibility for most credit decisions to regional credit personnel. Our credit policies, together with careful monitoring of customer balances, have resulted in bad debt expense of less than 0.2% of revenue in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016. Approximately 99% of our sales in 2018 were to customers to whom we had provided credit for those sales.
Backlog
 Our customers generally order products on an as-needed basis. As a result, a substantial portion of product shipments in a given fiscal quarter result from orders received in that same quarter. Consequently, order backlog represents only a very small percentage of the product sales that we anticipate in a given quarter and is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future period.
Trade Names
 Historically, Huttig has operated under various trade names in the markets we serve, retaining the names of acquired businesses for a period of time to preserve local identification, including in our acquisition of the business, BenBilt Building Systems LP (“BenBilt”) in April 2016. To capitalize on our national presence, all of our distribution centers operate under the primary trade name “Huttig Building Products” with the exception of BenBilt. Huttig has no material patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises or concessions other than BenBilt®, Endocote Finishing System®, the Huttig Building Products® name and logo, Huttiguard®, Huttig-Guard®, Huttig-Guard Pro®, Huttig-Guard Premium®, Huttig-Guard Platinum®, No-Split Huttig-Grip®, and Huttig-Spin®  which are registered trademarks.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 1,360 people, of which approximately 12% were represented by one of eight unions. We have not experienced any significant strikes or other work interruptions in recent years and have maintained generally favorable relations with our employees.
