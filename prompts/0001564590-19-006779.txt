Overview 
 We are a pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development, and commercialization of therapies for serious rare and life-threatening diseases with significant unmet medical needs. Our pipeline includes three clinical-stage candidates: EDSIVO™ (celiprolol) for the treatment of vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (“vEDS”) in patients with a confirmed type III collagen (COL3A1) mutation; ACER-001 (a fully taste-masked, immediate release formulation of sodium phenylbutyrate) for the treatment of various inborn errors of metabolism, including urea cycle disorders (“UCD”), Maple Syrup Urine Disease (“MSUD”), and osanetant for the treatment of various neuroendocrine disorders. Our product candidates are believed to present a comparatively de-risked profile, having one or more of a favorable safety profile, clinical proof-of-concept data, mechanistic differentiation, and an accelerated path for development, which may include utilizing expedited programs (e.g., Priority Review) established by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and/or using the regulatory pathway established under section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”) that allows an applicant to rely at least in part on third-party data for approval, which may expedite the preparation, submission, and approval of a marketing application.
 Our current product candidate pipeline is summarized in the chart below:

 Product Candidates 
 EDSIVO™ 
 Background 
 Our most advanced product candidate is EDSIVO™ (celiprolol) for the treatment of vEDS. EDSIVO™ is a selective adrenergic modulator and, if approved for marketing by the FDA, would be a New Chemical Entity (“NCE”) in the United States. Celiprolol is currently approved in the European Union for the treatment of hypertension and angina. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (“EDS”) is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the genes responsible for the structure, production, or processing of collagen, an important component of the connective tissues in the human body, or proteins that interact with collagen. EDS is a spectrum disorder where patients present with various forms, the most serious of which is vEDS, also known as EDS type IV, which is generally caused by a mutation in the COL3A1 gene. vEDS causes abnormal fragility in blood vessels, which can give rise to aneurysms, abnormal connections between blood vessels known as arteriovenous fistulas, arterial dissections, and spontaneous vascular ruptures, all of which can be potentially life-threatening. Gastrointestinal and uterine fragility or rupture also commonly occur in vEDS patients. Spontaneous arterial rupture has a peak incidence in the third or fourth decade of life in vEDS patients but may occur earlier and is the most common cause of sudden death in vEDS patients. Arterial rupture or dissection events occur in about 25% of patients before the age of 20 but increase to roughly 90% of patients by the age of 40. The median survival age of vEDS patients in the United States is 51 years, with arterial rupture being the most common cause of sudden death. 
 Pregnancy-related complications also occur in women with vEDS and include arterial dissection or rupture, uterine rupture, hemorrhage, premature rupture of membranes, lacerations, and complications during and after surgery. 
 Diagnosis and Incidence 
 vEDS is diagnosed through clinical observation, which is usually confirmed by mutational analysis of the COL3A1 gene. In the absence of a family history of the disorder, however, most vEDS patients are not diagnosed until the occurrence of an arterial aneurysm or dissection, bowel perforation, or organ rupture. As a result, it has been difficult to precisely measure the incidence or prevalence of vEDS in any population. Studies estimate the prevalence of vEDS as ranging from approximately 1 in 90,000 to 1 in 250,000. In 2017, we commissioned a patient-finder study that phenotypically identified 4,169 vEDS patients in the United States from an analysis of a commercially available patient claims database, with data of approximately 190 million unique patient lives. Based 
 3

on that information, we estimate the prevalence of phenotypically-defined vEDS in the United States could be greater than 1 in 45,000. 
 Current Treatment Options for vEDS 
 Currently, there are no approved pharmacologic therapies in the United States or the European Union for the treatment of vEDS. Medical intervention for vEDS focuses on surgery, symptomatic treatment, genetic counseling and prophylactic measures, such as avoiding intense physical activity, scuba diving, and violent sports. Arterial, digestive or uterine complications in vEDS patients typically require immediate hospitalization, observation in an intensive care unit, and sometimes surgery. Pregnant women with vEDS are considered to be at risk and receive special care. 
 While vEDS patients are encouraged to take steps to minimize the chances of an arterial rupture or dissection, there are no pharmacologic options to reduce the likelihood of such an event, and accordingly all current treatments for vEDS focus on the repair of arterial ruptures or dissection. Therefore, patients must adopt a “watch and wait” approach following any confirmed diagnosis. Unfortunately, many of these arterial events have high mortality associated with them, and thus, a pharmacologic intervention that reduces the rate of events would be clinically meaningful. 
 EDSIVO™ for Treatment of vEDS 
 Rationale for EDSIVO™ Treatment in vEDS 
 In 2004, researchers at Assistance Publique—Hôpitaux de Paris, Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou (“AP-HP”) in Paris, France, published data on vEDS patients, observing that an abnormally low intima-media thickness generates a higher wall stress than in control subjects at the site of an elastic artery, which may increase the risk of arterial dissection and rupture. Based on this observation, the investigators aimed to assess the preventive effect of celiprolol for major cardiovascular events in patients with vEDS via a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open trial with blinded evaluation of clinical events, which is referred to herein as the Ong trial. Results from the Ong trial were published on October 30, 2010 in The Lancet. The Ong trial was funded by the French Ministry of Health, and the principal investigator for the study was Professor Pierre Boutouyrie. 
 Fifty-three participants were enrolled in the Ong trial and randomized at eight centers in France and one center in Belgium. Patient ages ranged from 15 to 65 (with a mean age of 35), with a female-to-male ratio of 2-to-1. Patients were randomly assigned to a five-year intervention, receiving either celiprolol or no treatment, with important phenotype characteristics equally balanced between the celiprolol group and the control group. Celiprolol was administered twice daily to patients in the celiprolol group and the dosage was up-titrated every six months by 100 milligrams per day to a maximum of 400 milligrams per day. Patients assigned to the control group received the same attention as those assigned to the celiprolol group but did not receive celiprolol or any beta blocker. Thirty-three of the 53 patients participating in the study had proven mutations in the COL3A1 gene. Of those patients with proven mutations, demographic and arterial characteristics did not differ from those of the study population as a whole. The duration of follow-up was five years or until the first qualifying cardiac or arterial event. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiac or arterial events (rupture or dissection, fatal or not) during follow-up. Secondary endpoints were gastrointestinal or uterine rupture. The study was ended early after a consensus decision of the safety monitoring board, the methodologist of AP-HP, and the principal investigator because significant differences were recorded between the treatment group and the control group after 64 months. Mean duration of follow-up was 47 months prior to trial halt. As described in the tables below, in 5 of 25 patients on celiprolol a primary endpoint was recorded, compared with 14 of 28 patients in the control group. The hazard ratio (“HR”) for event-free survival, was 0.36, (95% CI 0.15—0.88; p=0.040), meaning that with celiprolol the risk of having a cardiac or arterial event was reduced by 64% compared to control. Combined primary and secondary endpoints affected 6 patients on celiprolol and 17 patients in the control group, (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.14—0.71; p=0.010):

As described in the table below, in the 33 patients with COL3A1 mutations, the primary endpoint was noted in 2 of the 13 patients in the treatment group, compared with 11 of the 20 patients in the control group, (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.08—0.71; p=0.041). Combined primary and secondary endpoints were recorded in 3 of 13 patients on celiprolol and 14 of the patients in the control group, (HR 0.25; 95% CI 0.10—0.64; p=0.017), correlating to a three times reduction in arterial events among treated patients compared to non-treated patients. The results in the trial did not vary significantly between those patients who had a confirmed mutation in the COL3A1 gene versus the overall 53-patient population:

 AP-HP granted us an exclusive right to access and use the data generated by the Ong trial. We have conducted a retrospective, source-verified analysis of that data, including the primary and secondary endpoints, which confirmed the published results of the Ong trial.
 Celiprolol is a selective adrenergic modulator, acting as a cardioselective beta1 adrenoceptor antagonist with partial beta2 adrenoceptor agonist activity, beta3 agonist activity, and alpha2 antagonist activity and with intrinsic sympathomimetic and vasodilating properties. 
 The potential benefit of celiprolol in vEDS is thought to be mediated through a combination of agonist activity at beta2 and beta3 adrenergic receptors, and antagonist activity at alpha2 adrenergic receptors. While the exact mechanism is not fully understood, it has been proposed that it could exert its effects through vascular smooth muscle relaxation and dilatation, thereby decreasing the mechanical stress on collagen fibers in the arterial wall. Celiprolol has also been shown to increase the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (“eNOS”) messenger ribonucleic acid (“mRNA”) and protein, and to activate phosphorylation of eNOS through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (“PI3K”)-Akt signaling pathway. eNOS is known to catalyze the synthesis of nitric oxide (“NO”) in blood 
 6

vessels, and NO plays a critical role in maintaining blood pressure (“BP”) homeostasis and vascular integrity. Celiprolol’s potential effect in vEDS is not thought to be substantially mediated via antagonist activity at the beta1 adrenergic receptor, as vEDS patients are typically normotensive, and as brachial systolic and diastolic blood pressures have been shown to not decrease in vEDS patients after treatment with celiprolol. Thus, the potential protective effect of celiprolol in vEDS patients is believed to be independent of any effect on BP lowering. We do not believe that there are any other drugs approved or in development in the United States or Europe that have a similar mechanism of action to celiprolol:
 

Registration Plan
 Celiprolol has not been approved for any indication in the United States. Celiprolol has been approved for the treatment of hypertension in the European Union since 1984. An NDA for celiprolol for the treatment for hypertension was submitted to the FDA by Rorer (subsequently acquired by Aventis Pharma SA (“Aventis”)) in June 1987 but was withdrawn prior to FDA review and therefore never approved. We have obtained from Aventis the exclusive right in North and South America to reference the celiprolol data included in the marketing authorization dossier filed with and approved by the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”). We have also licensed from AP-HP exclusive worldwide rights to the data from the Ong trial.
 The FDA has accepted for review our NDA for EDSIVO™ for the treatment of vEDS in patients with a confirmed type III collagen (COL3A1) mutation. The FDA also granted a priority review of the NDA and assigned a PDUFA target action date of June 25, 2019. Priority review is a designation granted by the FDA to accelerate the review process for drugs that offer a significant improvement in treatment or provide treatment where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists.
 Additionally, a manuscript for the Paris (AP-HP) vEDS patient re
gistry data has been submitted for publication in a top-tier cardiology journal and is currently under peer review. If published, we will submit the manuscript to the FDA for review as part of our NDA and as supplemental data to the Ong trial.

ACER-001
 Background
 Sodium phenylbutyrate (“NaPB”) is currently approved in the United States and the European Union to treat patients with UCD. Our product candidate ACER-001 is a fully taste-masked, immediate release formulation of NaPB, designed to potentially treat UCD and MSUD. 
Urea Cycle Disorders (UCD) Background
 The urea cycle is a series of biochemical reactions that occur primarily in the liver, which converts toxic ammonia produced by the breakdown of protein and other nitrogen-containing molecules in the human body into urea for excretion. UCD are a group of disorders caused by genetic mutations that result in a deficiency in one of the six enzymes that catalyze the urea cycle, which can lead to an excess accumulation of ammonia in the bloodstream, a condition known as hyperammonemia. Acute hyperammonemia can cause lethargy, somnolence, coma, and multi-organ failure, while chronic hyperammonemia can lead to headaches, confusion, lethargy, failure to thrive, behavioral changes, and learning and cognitive deficits. Common symptoms of both acute and chronic hyperammonemia also include seizures and psychiatric symptoms.
Diagnosis and Incidence
 The diagnosis of UCD is based on clinical observations, confirmed by biochemical and molecular genetic testing. A plasma ammonia concentration of 150 lmol/L or higher associated with a normal anion gap and a normal plasma glucose concentration is an indication for the presence of UCD. Plasma quantitative amino acid analysis and measurement of urinary orotic acid can distinguish between the various types of UCD. A definitive diagnosis of UCD depends on either molecular genetic testing or measurement of enzyme activity. Molecular genetic testing is possible for all urea cycle defects. Studies suggest that the incidence of UCD in the United States is 1 in 35,000 live births. Approximately 2,000 patients suffer from UCD in the United States.
 Current Treatment Options for UCD
 The current treatment of UCD consists of dietary management to limit ammonia production in conjunction with medications that provide alternative pathways for the removal of ammonia from the bloodstream. Dietary protein must be carefully monitored and some restriction is necessary; too much dietary protein causes excessive ammonia production. However, if protein intake is too restrictive or insufficient calories are consumed, the body will break down lean muscle mass to obtain the amino acids or energy it requires, which can also lead to excessive ammonia in the bloodstream. Dietary management may also include supplementation with special amino acid formulas developed specifically for UCD, which can be prescribed to provide approximately 50% of the daily dietary protein allowance. Some patients may also require individual branched-chain amino acid supplementation.
 Medications for UCD primarily comprise nitrogen scavenger drugs, which are substances that provide alternative excretion pathways for nitrogen by bypassing the urea cycle. The use of these alternative pathways for nitrogen removal is important for the management of acute episodes of hyperammonemia and are also included as part of a long-term treatment regime for UCD patients. Current nitrogen scavenger treatments for UCD are based on sodium benzoate or phenylbutyrate, which conjugate with glycine and glutamine, respectively, allowing for urinary excretion of nitrogen as hippurate and phenylacetylglutamine, respectively.
 According to a 2016 study by Shchelochkov et al., published in Molecular Genetics and Metabolism Reports, while nitrogen scavenging medications are effective in helping to manage UCD, non-compliance with treatment is common. Reasons given for non-compliance include the unpleasant taste associated with available medications, the frequency with which medication must be taken and the high cost of the medication.
 Phenylbutyrate is available as both NaPB, which is marketed as Buphenyl®, and glycerol phenylbutyrate, which is marketed as Ravicti®. While a study provided by Horizon Therapeutics, Inc. in the Ravicti package insert 
 8

involving 46 adults with UCD demonstrated that Buphenyl and Ravicti were similarly effective in controlling the blood level of ammonia over a 24-hour period, many patients who take their medicine orally prefer Ravicti, as it is significantly more palatable than Buphenyl. However, the cost of Ravicti, at approximately $800,000 per patient per year (based on patient weight), is often prohibitive.
 In cases where dietary management or medication is not effective, patients with UCD may require a liver transplant.
 ACER-001 for Treatment of UCD
 Rationale for ACER-001 Treatment in UCD
 ACER-001 is a proprietary, immediate release, taste-masked suspension formulation of NaPB. Buphenyl, a non-taste-masked formulation of NaPB, has been approved by the FDA for UCD with demonstrated efficacy and safety in UCD patients of all ages. We believe that if it is approved, ACER-001’s taste-masked properties will make it a compelling alternative to existing phenylbutyrate-based treatments, as the unpleasant taste associated with NaPB is cited as a major impediment to patient compliance with those treatments.
 Registration Plan
 We intend to initially seek FDA approval to market ACER-001 in the United States using a 505(b)(2) NDA. We also intend to seek approval in the European Union and potentially other territories outside the United States, after the 505(b)(2) NDA for treatment of UCD is filed. Because the FDA has approved an NDA for NaPB, which is referred to as the reference listed drug (“RLD”), we intend to rely on the RLD’s pre-clinical and clinical safety data, while supplementing the data with a bridging study that demonstrates bioequivalence of ACER-001 to NaPB. We anticipate submitting to the FDA the 505(b)(2) NDA for ACER-001 for the treatment of UCD late in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD)
 Background
 MSUD is a rare inherited disorder caused by defects in the mitochondrial branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase complex, which results in elevated blood levels of the branched-chain amino acids (“BCAA”), leucine, valine, and isoleucine, as well as the associated branded-chain ketoacids (“BCKA”) in a patient’s blood. Left untreated, this can result in neurological damage, mental disability, coma or death. There are currently no approved pharmacologic therapies in the United States or the European Union for MSUD. Treatment of MSUD consists primarily of a severely restricted diet to limit the intake of BCAA, with aggressive medical interventions when blood-levels of BCAA or BCKA become elevated. The most severe presentation of MSUD, known as “classic” MSUD, accounts for 80% of cases and can result in neonatal onset with encephalopathy and coma. Although metabolic management of the disease is possible via a highly restrictive diet, the outcome is unpredictable and a significant portion of affected individuals are mentally impaired or experience neurological complications.
 Studies indicate that MSUD affects an estimated 1 in 185,000 infants worldwide. The disorder occurs more frequently in the Old Order Mennonite population, with an estimated incidence of about 1 in 380 newborns, and the Ashkenazi Jewish population, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 26,000. Approximately 3,000 patients suffer from MSUD worldwide, of whom approximately 800 are located in the United States.
 ACER-001 for Treatment of MSUD
 Rationale for ACER-001 Treatment in MSUD
 Therapy with NaPB in UCD patients has been associated with a selective reduction in BCAA despite adequate dietary protein intake.
 9

Based on this clinical observation, investigators at Baylor College of Medicine (“BCM”) explored the potential of NaPB treatment to lower BCAA and their corresponding BCKA in patients with MSUD. The investigators found that BCAA and BCKA were both significantly reduced following NaPB therapy in control subjects and in patients with MSUD, although there was no simple correlation between the patients’ levels of residual enzymatic activity with the response of plasma BCAA and their BCKA to NaPB. NaPB demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of leucine in all three healthy subjects and in three out of the five MSUD patients who participated in the trial. The reduction in leucine, the most toxic of the BCAAs, in the three responsive MSUD patients ranged between 28-34%, which is considered by clinicians to be a meaningful response.
 Registration Plan
 We intend to seek FDA approval to market ACER-001 for the treatment of MSUD in the United States by submitting a 505(b)(2) NDA using data from the RLD’s NDA while supplementing the data with additional pharmokinetic, pharmodynamic, efficacy and safety data specifically in the MSUD population. We anticipate submitting to the FDA the 505(b)(2) NDA for ACER-001 for the treatment of MSUD late in 2021, subject to our ability to generate sufficient capital resources to fund this program. We also intend to seek approval in the European Union and other territories outside the United States after the 505(b)(2) NDA for treatment of MSUD is filed.
ACER-001 Planned Clinical Development in MSUD Patients
 Subject to our ability to generate sufficient capital resources, we intend to support a 505(b)(2) NDA for ACER-001 for the treatment of MSUD by submitting an IND in the second half of 2019. The following four clinical trials are planned:
Study One
 This multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled clinical trial is expected to enroll approximately 60 subjects with MSUD ages 8 to 48 years, who have baseline blood leucine levels >150 μmol/L, while achieving steady-state leucine intake via a restricted diet. All subjects will receive ACER-001 for 7 days. Response will be defined as a greater than or equal to 30% decrease in blood leucine from baseline. 
Study Two
 This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is expected to enroll approximately 40 subjects with MSUD who responded to sodium phenylbutyrate in Study 1. After a washout period from Study 1, subjects will be randomized equally to either ACER-001 or placebo for four weeks. Efficacy will be assessed by the mean change in blood leucine level from baseline to week four in the ACER-001-treated group as compared to the mean change in the placebo group.
Study Three
 This multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled clinical trial is expected to enroll approximately 20 subjects with MSUD who did not respond to sodium phenylbutyrate in Study 1. After a washout period from Study 1, subjects will undergo six weeks of forced dose-titration with three different doses of ACER-001. Treatments will consist of three consecutive two-week courses of ACER-001 at increasing doses above the top dose studied in Study 1. Blood leucine levels will be monitored after two weeks of treatment at each dose level.
Study Four
 This multicenter, open-label, extension study is expected to enroll up to 60 subjects who respond to ACER-001 treatment in Study 1 and complete Study 2, and any subjects from Study 3 who are identified as responders 
 10

following dose titration. Blood leucine levels will be monitored every four weeks, and additional safety information will be collected.
 Osanetant
 Background 
 Osanetant is a clinical-stage, selective, non-peptide tachykinin NK3 receptor antagonist. NK3R is the main receptor for neurokinin B (“NKB”), a tachykinin peptide primarily found in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus. In December 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Sanofi to acquire worldwide rights to osanetant.
 Rationale for Osanetant Treatment for Neuroendocrine-Related Disorders
 NKB/NK3R is implicated in a variety of human functions and affects the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis, which plays a critical part in the development and regulation of a number of the body’s systems, such as the reproductive and immune systems. Clinical proof of concept studies with other NK3R antagonists have demonstrated rapid and clinically-meaningful improvement in vasomotor symptoms and polycystic ovarian syndrome. 
 Osanetant was originally developed by Sanofi for the treatment of symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Development was discontinued in 2005. Osanetant was shown to be safe and well tolerated at the doses studied in healthy subjects and schizophrenic patients: we have clinical and laboratory safety results with osanetant from 21 completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies in a total of 1,586 people, of whom 325 were healthy subjects and 665 patients were treated with osanetant. Osanetant is orally bioavailable and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. We believe that several disorders involving the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis could benefit from treatment with an NK3R antagonist.
 Registration Plan
 We anticipate filing an IND for osanetant with the FDA in the second half of 2019. We plan to explore treatment with osanetant in multiple rare and life-threatening neuroendocrine disorders in multiple phase 1/2 studies, evaluating pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety, subject to our ability to raise sufficient capital reserves to fund these clinical studies.
Commercialization Strategy 
 Assuming the FDA approves EDSIVOTM and ACER-001, we expect that the majority of vEDS, UCD and MSUD patients will be treated at tertiary care centers, and therefore can be addressed with a targeted sales force. vEDS patients will primarily be treated by vascular medicine or cardiology specialists, while the UCD and MSUD patients will primarily be managed by metabolic geneticists and dietitians. We intend to build our own commercial infrastructure in the United States to target these centers and will evaluate whether to commercialize in other geographies ourselves or with an experienced partner. 
 We are in the process of formulating our commercialization strategy for osanetant and the specific rare and life-threatening neuroendocrine disorders that we intend to target.
 Competition 
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. We face competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Given the significant unmet medical needs for novel therapies to treat vEDS, UCD and MSUD, many companies, public and private universities and research organizations are actively engaged in the discovery, research and development of product candidates to treat these conditions. As a result, there are and will likely continue to be extensive resources invested 
 11

in the discovery and development of new products to treat these unmet medical needs. We anticipate facing intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available. 
 We are not aware of any other companies that are pursuing a treatment for vEDS, although we are aware of a study that is currently enrolling vEDS patients at AP-HP that includes adding irbesartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, with celiprolol, to provide supplemental vascular protection and thus reduce recurrence of arterial events in vEDS patients. Our potential competitors and the related stage of development for their product candidates in our other target indications for ACER-001 include the following: 
  
• | UCD: Horizon Pharma plc / SOBI, Inc. (Marketed); Promethera Biosciences S.A./N.V. (Phase 2); Aeglea BioTherapeutics Inc. (Phase 1/2); Dimension Therapeutics Inc. (Phase 1/2); Synlogic, Inc. (preclinical)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MSUD: Synlogic, Inc. (preclinical)
--+-----------------------------------

 Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have or will have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in developing or marketing products and technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly. Additionally, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly and may achieve more widespread market acceptance. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
 There are other non-pharmaceutical therapeutic approaches that are used or may be used for our targeted indications. For example, liver transplantation may be used in some cases to treat UCD or MSUD in pediatric patients who have developed acute liver failure. 
 We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, convenience in dosing, product labeling, price, and the availability of reimbursement. 
 Licenses
 Baylor College of Medicine (“BCM”)
 In April 2014, we obtained exclusive rights to patents and certain other intellectual property relating to ACER-001 and preclinical and clinical data, through an exclusive license agreement with BCM. Under the terms of the agreement, as amended, we have worldwide exclusive rights to develop, manufacture, use, sell and import products incorporating the licensed intellectual property. The license agreement requires us to make upfront and annual payments to BCM, reimburse certain of BCM’s legal costs, make payments upon achievement of defined milestones, and pay low single-digit percent royalties on net sales of any developed product over the royalty term. 
Aventis Pharma SA 
 In June 2016, we entered into an agreement with Aventis Pharma SA (now Sanofi) granting us the exclusive access and exclusive right to use the data included in the marketing authorization application dossier filed with and approved by the MHRA in 1986 for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension pursuant to the UK regulatory approval procedure, for the sole purpose of allowing us to further develop, manufacture, register and commercialize celiprolol in the United States and Brazil for the treatment of EDS, Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. We have paid in full for the exclusive access and right to use the data. Subsequently we amended our agreement with Sanofi to provide the same rights to data access and use for potential marketing approval in all of North and South America.
 
12

Assistance Publique—Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) 
 In August 2016, we entered into an agreement with AP-HP granting us the exclusive worldwide rights to access and use data from the Ong trial. We intend to use this pivotal clinical data to support an NDA filing for EDSIVOTM for the treatment of vEDS. The agreement required us to make certain upfront payments to AP-HP, reimburse certain of AP-HP’s costs, make payments upon achievement of defined milestones and pay low single-digit percent royalties on net sales of celiprolol over the royalty term. 
 In September 2018, we entered into an additional agreement with AP-HP to acquire the exclusive worldwide intellectual property rights to three European patent applications relating to certain uses of celiprolol including (i) the use of celiprolol during pregnancy, (ii) the optimal dose of celiprolol in treating vEDS patients and (iii) the use of celiprolol to treat kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type VI). Pursuant to the agreement, we will reimburse AP-HP for certain costs and will pay annual maintenance fee payments. Subject to a minimum royalty amount, we will also pay royalty payments on annual net sales of celiprolol during the royalty term in the low single digit percent range, depending upon whether there is a valid claim of a licensed patent. Under the agreement, we will control and pay the costs of ongoing patent prosecution and maintenance for the licensed applications. We subsequently filed three United States patent applications on this subject matter in October 2018.
 Sanofi
 In December 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Sanofi granting us worldwide rights to osanetant, a clinical-stage, selective, non-peptide tachykinin NK3 receptor antagonist. We plan to initially pursue development of osanetant as a potential treatment for certain neuroendocrine-related disorders. The agreement required us to make an upfront payment to Sanofi, with further payments due upon achievement of defined development and sales milestones, and to pay royalties on our net sales of osanetant over the royalty term.
Manufacturing 
 We contract with third parties for the manufacture, testing, and storage of our product candidates and intend to continue to do so in the future. We do not own and have no plans to build our own manufacturing capabilities for clinical or commercial supply. We have hired both internal resources and consultants with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical, regulatory and quality assurance and control experience to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions. 
Intellectual Property 
 EDSIVO™ 
 We intend to protect our commercial rights to EDSIVOTM in the United States via multiple pathways. We believe that we will be eligible for NCE exclusivity for EDSIVOTM, which provides upon approval of an NCE five years of marketing exclusivity, during which time the FDA will not approve another drug with the same active ingredient, regardless of the indication for use, in the United States. In January 2015, the FDA granted EDSIVOTM Orphan Drug Designation, which provides upon the approval of a drug intended to treat a rare condition seven years of marketing exclusivity during which time the FDA will not approve the same drug for the same indication, unless it demonstrates clinical superiority. Orphan Drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving the same drug for a different indication, or a different drug for the same indication. NCE exclusivity and Orphan Drug exclusivity run concurrently. Furthermore, EDSIVOTM may qualify for an additional six months of pediatric exclusivity in the United States, which requires the submission of one or more studies in pediatric subjects that meet requirements to be specified by the FDA in a written request for pediatric studies. Pediatric exclusivity can be obtained either before or after NDA approval. Pediatric exclusivity is attached to the end of an existing exclusivity and runs consecutively. We may also consider making modifications to the formulation to obtain additional intellectual property. While unapproved drugs may be imported into the United States under specified circumstances, such as for use in clinical studies under a valid and effective IND or for further manufacture into an IND drug or an approved drug, we intend to aggressively assert our rights, via regulatory and legal means, to limit 
 13

the importation of non-FDA approved versions of celiprolol. We intend to provide a robust patient assistance program (“PAP”) to offset costs associated with a high priced therapeutic to minimize the incentive for vEDS patients in the United States to seek to obtain celiprolol elsewhere. 
 In October 2018, we filed three United States patent applications relating to certain uses of celiprolol including (i) the use of celiprolol during pregnancy, (ii) the optimal dose of celiprolol in treating vEDS patients and (iii) the use of celiprolol to treat kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type VI).
 ACER-001 
 We obtained exclusive rights to certain patents and other intellectual property from BCM for the use of NaPB for the treatment of inborn errors of BCAA metabolism, including MSUD. 
 The licensed patent covers methods and compositions for treating humans (and animals) with various formulations and prodrugs of NaPB for inborn errors of BCAA metabolism, including MSUD, and does not expire until 2030. We made filings in the geographic regions that represent the largest incidence and prevalence of MSUD: the United States, selected countries in Europe (including Turkey), and Brazil. BCM has been issued one patent in each of the United States and the European Union with respect to ACER-001, each of which was exclusively licensed to us pursuant to our agreement with BCM. 
 We filed a formulation patent application with respect to ACER-001 in March 2016 and plan to seek further patent protection in major markets, including the United States and the European Union. 
 We also expect to benefit from potential commercial exclusivity afforded to the first drug approved after obtaining Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of MSUD. Orphan Drug exclusivity provides, upon the approval by the FDA of a drug intended to treat a rare condition, seven years of marketing exclusivity, during which time the FDA will not approve the same drug for the same indication unless it demonstrates clinical superiority. Orphan Drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving the same drug for a different indication, or a different drug for the same indication. We were granted Orphan Drug designation for ACER-001 for the treatment of MSUD by the FDA in August 2014.
 Furthermore, we may qualify to receive an additional six months of pediatric exclusivity in the United States, which runs consecutively to an existing exclusivity.
 Osanetant
 We intend to explore various pathways to protect our commercial rights to osanetant in multiple rare and life-threatening neuroendocrine disorders, including evaluating filing patent applications and acquiring existing intellectual property. 
Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the use of unapproved drugs, pre-clinical and clinical studies, development, testing, quality control, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, import, and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The process for obtaining approvals or authorizations to market a drug product in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with pre- and post-approval compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of approval requirements within the European Union are addressed uniformly, while country-specific requirements must also be met. 
 14

United States Drug Approval Process. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FFDCA and the FDA’s implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining marketing approvals and pre- and post-approval compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time before or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve a pending NDA, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold on a clinical study or studies, issuance of a warning letter or untitled letter, product recall, product seizure, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunction, fines, refusals or cancellation of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s current good laboratory practice (“cGLP”) regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND to which the FDA has no objections and which must become effective before clinical trials in the United States may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”) for each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Clinical Practice (“cGCP”) regulations, IND regulations, and human subject protection regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulation and to assure that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, manufacture, processing, and packing are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 Preclinical Studies. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical trial protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises questions or concerns, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to patients under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with IND regulations and human subject protection regulations as well as cGCP standards, which include the requirement that all research patients provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial and that an IRB approve each study before it begins. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB for each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol and protocol amendment for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted 
 15

within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three or four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
 Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life-threatening disease to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
 Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for a specific targeted disease, gather additional safety information and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage, and method of delivery. 
 Phase 3: The drug is administered to a larger patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product to determine effectiveness, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product and ultimately to support approval. 
 Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post-approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious and unexpected adverse reactions occur. Trial sponsors must monitor other information including published as well as unpublished scientific papers, reports from foreign regulatory authorities and reports of foreign commercial marketing experience for the investigational drug and notify the FDA and clinical trial investigators of certain information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may fail to be completed successfully within a specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA may impose a clinical hold on one or more or all of the clinical studies or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial or development of an investigational product at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Development, or the aspects of development, that are affected by the clinical hold may not continue unless and until the sponsor addresses all of the FDA’s concerns and has been notified that the hold is removed. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate its approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the protocol or the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Nearly all Phase 3 trials and some other trials are overseen by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) which is composed of doctors, statisticians, and others who are independent of the clinical trial sponsor. Similar to IRBs, the DSMBs review the progress of a clinical trial and participant safety, but they also review data on the effectiveness of the drug being studied. DSMB members can stop a trial early if safety concerns arise or if they determine that the trial should be stopped due to “futility” meaning that the trial will not be able to answer the question or questions it set out to explore. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may need to complete additional animal trials and must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be completed to establish an expiration date and demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration prior to the expiration date. 
 The NDA Approval Process. Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, 
 16

among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA to support approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. 
 The FDA is required to conduct a preliminary review of an NDA within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting it for filing, to determine whether it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may accept the NDA for filing, potentially refuse to file the NDA due to deficiencies but work with the applicant to rectify the deficiencies (in which case the NDA is filed upon resolution of the deficiencies) or refuse to file the NDA. The FDA must notify the applicant of a refusal to file a decision within 60 days after the original receipt date of the application. If the FDA refuses to file the NDA the applicant may resubmit the NDA with the deficiencies addressed. The resubmitted NDA is considered a new application subject to a new ten-month review goal, as described below. If the NDA is resubmitted for the same product (by the same person) a new application fee will not be required. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once an NDA is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) and the FDA’s commitments under the current PDUFA Reauthorization Act, the FDA has a goal of reviewing and acting on 90% of standard non-priority NDA applications within ten months from the filing date of the NDA. 
 The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation in response to specific questions raised by the FDA, which may include whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA inspects the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect and audit data at one or more clinical sites to evaluate the integrity of the data and confirm compliance with cGCP. 
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts its inspections, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug subject to specific prescribing information for specific indications and, if applicable, specific post-approval requirements. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. After receiving a Complete Response Letter, the applicant must decide within twelve months (subject to extension), if it wants to resubmit the NDA addressing the deficiencies identified by the FDA in the Complete Response Letter, withdraw the NDA, or request an opportunity for a hearing to challenge the FDA’s determination. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. 
 The FDA also may require implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. 
 The drug testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and may take several years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval. The FDA may not grant marketing approval on a timely basis, or at all. 
 17

Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product. The FDA requires that the approved product labeling include information regarding contraindications, warnings or precautions. It may also require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, including a long-term registry, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or labeling claims or manufacturing changes may be subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. Also after approval, the FDA may require labeling changes as new information becomes known, particularly if new risks are identified, such as unexpected adverse events. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of these post-marketing studies and programs or other information that may become known after approval. 
 Hatch-Waxman Amendments and Exclusivity. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, amended the FFDCA and established abbreviated pathways to market, as well as incentives for the development of new drug products. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments established section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA that provides an alternative pathway for submission of an NDA, referred to as the 505(b)(2) application, when some or all of the safety and efficacy investigations relied on for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also established the abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) approval pathway, which provides an expedient route for generic drugs that have the same active ingredient as a previously approved drug. At the same time, to incentivize continued pharmaceutical innovation, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments authorized periods of market exclusivity to protect certain approved new drugs from competition for five- or three-year periods. 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a new drug containing an active ingredient that had never before been approved in any other NDA, ANDA, or 505(b)(2) NDA is provided five years of market exclusivity upon approval. The FDA refers to this exclusivity as NCE exclusivity. During the NCE exclusivity period, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) application for a drug containing the same active ingredient. For NCE exclusivity, the FDA regulations interpret “active ingredient” to mean “active moiety,” which is defined as “the molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt . . . , or other noncovalent derivative . . . of the molecule, responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance.” Although the FDA may not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA with the same active ingredient during the five-year NCE exclusivity period, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted to the FDA after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide three years of market exclusivity for an NDA, a 505(b)(2) NDA, or a supplement to either of these applications for a drug product containing an active moiety that has been previously approved, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. During this three-year exclusivity period, the FDA will not make effective the approval of any ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety for the same conditions of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a new drug containing the same active moiety if it is the subject of a full NDA for which the applicant conducted, sponsored, or obtained a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Other Regulatory Requirements. Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, annual establishment registration and product listing and associated user fees, compliance with the cGMP, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and adverse drug experience monitoring and reporting with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product labeling, such as adding new indications are subject to prior FDA review and approval. Also, any post-approval changes in the drug substance, drug product, production process, quality controls, equipment, or facilities that have a substantial potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug product is subject to FDA review and approval. Any such changes that have a moderate potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, 
 18

quality, purity, or potency of the drug product must be submitted to the FDA for review 30 days prior to implementation. All manufacturing facilities, as well as records required to be maintained under FDA regulations, are subject to inspection or audit by the FDA. In addition, manufacturers are required to pay annual user fees for establishment registration and user fees for the submission of each new or supplemental application with clinical data.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 gave the FDA the authority to require a REMS from drug manufacturers to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with the drug and to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. Examples of a REMS include, but are not limited to, a Medication Guide, a patient package insert to help mitigate a serious risk of the drug, and a communication plan to health care providers to support the implementation of an element of the REMS. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and register or obtain permits or licenses in states where they do business, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over their activities to determine compliance with regulatory requirements. A drug manufacturer is responsible for ensuring that its third-party contractors operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including the cGMP regulation. The failure of a drug manufacturer or any of its third-party contractors to comply with federal or state laws or regulations may subject the drug manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as an untitled letter, warning letter, recall, suspension of manufacturing or distribution or both, suspension of state permit or license, seizure of product, import detention, injunctive action, civil and criminal penalties. 
 Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require a drug manufacturer to conduct investigations and implement appropriate corrective actions to address any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the manufacturer and any third-party contractors (including contract manufacturers and laboratories) involved in the manufacture of a drug product. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend significant time, money and effort to maintain and ensure ongoing cGMP compliance and to confirm and ensure ongoing cGMP compliance of their third-party contractors. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if there is new information or evidence that the drug is unsafe or not shown to be safe for use under the conditions of its approval, or that new information shows there is a lack of substantial evidence of effectiveness, or that the approved application contained an untrue statement of material fact, or that the required patent information was not submitted within 30 days after receiving notice from the FDA of the failure to submit such information. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety and risk information; imposition of a post-market study requirement to assess new safety risks; or implementation of a REMS that may include distribution or other restrictions. 
 The FDA closely regulates drug advertising and promotional activities, including promotion of an unapproved drug, direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of scientific information about a drug not on the approved labeling, off-label promotion, communications with payors and formulary committees, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. A company’s product claims must be true and not misleading, provide fair balance, provide adequate risk information, and be consistent with the product label approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can lead to regulatory actions including, among other things, warning letters, corrective advertising, injunction, violation and related penalties under the False Claims Act and result in reputational and economic harm. 
 Physicians may prescribe FDA-approved drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those uses tested by the manufacturer. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The 
 19

FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments for their individual patients. The FDA does, however, regulate manufacturers’ communications about their drug products and interprets the FFDCA to prohibit pharmaceutical companies from promoting their FDA-approved drug products for uses that are not specified in the FDA-approved labeling. Companies that market drugs for off-label uses have been subject to warning letters, related costly litigation, criminal prosecution, and civil liability under the FFDCA and the False Claims Act. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”) which regulates the distribution of drug and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of wholesale drug distributors by the states. 
 Orphan Designation. The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 provides incentives, including marketing exclusivity, user fee waivers and tax benefits, to companies that undertake development and marketing of products to treat rare diseases, which are defined as diseases for which there is a patient population of fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. A drug that receives Orphan Drug designation may receive up to seven years of exclusive marketing in the United States for that indication, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity. A drug may be entitled to an additional six months of exclusive marketing if it satisfies the requirements for pediatric exclusivity. 
 The European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”) grants Orphan Drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. In the European Union, Orphan Drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the Orphan Drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
 New Legislation and Regulations. From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we may obtain marketing approval. Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product typically is separate from the process for establishing the reimbursement rate that a payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Some third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. 
 In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory 
 20

approvals. Whether or not we conduct such studies, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drug products and medical services and questioning safety and efficacy. Emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the products for which we receive FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. 
 The United States government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs and drug prices in general, including for therapies for rare diseases. These measures include price controls, transparency requirements triggered by the introduction of new high-cost drugs into the market, drug re-importation, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Some laws and regulations have already been enacted in these areas, and additional measures have been introduced or are under consideration at both the federal and state levels. Additionally, at the request of United States Senators, the Government Accountability Office is currently investigating abuses of the Orphan Drug Act, which could potentially lead to legislation that affects reimbursement for drugs with small patient populations. Adoption of such controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as our drug product candidates and could adversely affect our net revenue and results. 
 In addition, in the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“the Affordable Care Act”) contains provisions that have the potential to substantially change healthcare delivery and financing, including impacting the profitability of drugs. For example, the Affordable Care Act revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs are calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of covered drugs dispensed to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations and subjected manufacturers to new annual fees for certain branded prescription drugs. On May 4, 2017, the House of Representatives passed the American Health Care Act (“AHCA”) which contains provisions that would change the level of federal funding of state Medicaid programs and affect funding for long term care recipients, including the elderly and disabled. The Senate then moved to craft its own “repeal and replace” legislation known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act (“BCRA”) with more onerous funding changes affecting the elderly and disabled relative to the Affordable Care Act. The BCRA and two other amendments failed in the Senate and it is unclear if the Senate will debate potential amendments further. However, even if a different bill or amendment passed in the Senate, reconciliation with the House’s AHCA bill would be required. Under any new legislation, we expect additional rules, regulations and interpretations to be issued that may materially affect our future financial condition and operations. Even if the Affordable Care Act is not amended or repealed, the current administration could propose changes impacting implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The ultimate composition and timing of any legislation enacted under the current administration that would impact the current implementation of the Affordable Care Act remains uncertain. Given the complexity of the Affordable Care Act and the substantial requirements for regulation thereunder, the impact of the Affordable Care Act on our financial conditions and operations cannot be predicted, whether in its current form or as amended or repealed.
 Pricing and reimbursement methodologies vary widely from country to country. Some countries require that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product

or they may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on our profitability in placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. 
 Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates, and drug pricing regulation may change at any time, and there is the potential for significant movement in these areas in the foreseeable future. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Healthcare Law and Regulation. Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescribing of any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, manufacture, market, promote, sell and distribute our products that obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws include, but are not limited to, the following:

• | the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal False Claims Act and civil monetary penalties law impose penalties and provide for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent or making a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) among other things, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without proper written authorization;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements under the Affordable Care Act requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies to annually report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) an agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and

governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

 Further, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal statutes governing healthcare fraud. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. 
 Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to it, we may be subject to significant administrative, civil, and/or criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to administrative, civil, and/or criminal sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. 
 Foreign Regulation. In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. The cost of establishing a regulatory compliance system for numerous varying jurisdictions can be very significant. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.

The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Other Anti-Corruption Laws 
 We may be subject to a variety of domestic and foreign anti-corruption laws with respect to our regulatory compliance efforts and operations. The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) is a criminal statute that prohibits an individual or business from paying, offering, promising or authorizing the provision of money (such as a bribe or kickback) or anything else of value (such as an improper gift, hospitality, or favor), directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining, retaining, or directing business or other advantages (such as favorable regulatory rulings). The FCPA also obligates companies with securities listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions. Those provisions require a company such as ours to (i) maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions, expenses, and asset dispositions, and (ii) devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are properly authorized, executed and recorded. The FCPA is subject to broad interpretation by the United States government. The past decade has seen a significant increase in enforcement activity. In addition to the FCPA, there are a number of other federal and state anti-corruption laws to which we may be subject, including, the United States domestic bribery statute contained in 18 USC § 201 (which prohibits bribing U.S. government officials) and the United States Travel Act (which in some instances addresses private-sector or commercial bribery both within and outside the United States). Also, a number of the countries in which we may conduct activities have their own domestic and international anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Bribery Act 2010. There have been cases where companies have faced multi-jurisdictional liability under the FCPA and the anti-corruption laws of other countries for the same illegal act. 
 We can be held liable under the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws for the illegal activities of our employees, representatives, contractors, collaborators, agents, subsidiaries, or affiliates, even if we did not explicitly authorize such activity. Although we will seek to comply with anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, collaborators, agents, subsidiaries or affiliates will comply with these laws at all times. Noncompliance with these laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain governments or other persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. In addition, our directors, officers, employees, and other representatives who engage in violations of the FCPA and certain other anti-corruption statutes may face imprisonment, fines, and penalties. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of our management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had twenty-three full-time employees and no part-time employees, in addition to a number of consultants or independent contractors working for us. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced a work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
Organizational History
 Merger and Reverse Stock Split
 On September 19, 2017, Acer Therapeutics Inc., a Texas corporation, formerly known as Opexa Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Registrant”), completed its business combination with Acer Therapeutics Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Private Acer”), in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of June 30, 2017, by and among the Registrant, Opexa Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”) and Private Acer (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Private Acer, with Private Acer surviving as a 
 24

wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant (the “Merger”). This transaction was approved by the Registrant’s stockholders at a special meeting of its stockholders on September 19, 2017. Also on September 19, 2017, in connection with, and prior to the completion of, the Merger, the Registrant effected a 1-for-10.355527 reverse stock split of its then outstanding common stock (the “Reverse Split”) and immediately following the Merger, the Registrant changed its name to “Acer Therapeutics Inc.” pursuant to amendments to its certificate of formation filed with the Texas Secretary of State on September 19, 2017. All share numbers in this report have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split.
 Following the completion of the Merger, the business conducted by the Registrant became primarily the business conducted by Private Acer.
 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Registrant issued shares of its common stock to Private Acer’s stockholders, at an exchange rate of one share of common stock (after giving effect to the Reverse Split and the conversion of Private Acer’s Series A and Series B preferred stock and convertible debt) in exchange for each share of Private Acer common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger. The exchange rate was determined through arm’s length negotiations between the Registrant and Private Acer. The Registrant also assumed all issued and outstanding stock options under the Acer Therapeutics Inc. 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, with such stock options henceforth representing the right to purchase a number of shares of the Registrant’s common stock equal to the number of shares of Private Acer’s common stock previously represented by such stock options.
 Immediately after the Merger: (i) there were approximately 6.5 million shares of the Registrant’s common stock outstanding; (ii) the former Private Acer stockholders, including investors in the Concurrent Financing (as defined below), owned approximately 89% of the outstanding common stock of the Registrant; and (iii) the Registrant’s shareholders immediately prior to the Merger, whose shares of the Registrant’s common stock remained outstanding after the Merger, owned approximately 11% of the outstanding common stock of the Registrant.
 The issuance of the shares of the Registrant’s common stock to the former stockholders of Private Acer was registered with the SEC on a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (Reg. No. 333-219358). Immediately prior to the Merger, Private Acer issued and sold an aggregate of approximately $15.7 million (inclusive of the conversion of approximately $5.7 million of principal and accrued interest on outstanding convertible promissory notes issued by Private Acer) of shares of Private Acer’s common stock (the “Concurrent Financing”) to certain current stockholders of Private Acer and certain new investors at a per share price of $9.47.
 The Registrant’s common stock continued to trade on a pre-split basis through the close of business on Wednesday, September 20, 2017 on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “OPXA.” Commencing with the open of trading on Thursday, September 21, 2017, the post-split shares began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “ACER.” 
 For accounting and financial reporting purposes, Private Acer was considered to have acquired the Registrant in the Merger. Private Acer was incorporated on December 26, 2013, as part of a reorganization whereby Acer Therapeutics, LLC was converted into a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware
 Delaware Reincorporation and Subsidiary Merger
 On May 15, 2018, we changed our state of incorporation from the State of Texas to the State of Delaware (the “Reincorporation”) pursuant to a plan of conversion, dated May 15, 2018. We filed the following instruments on May 15, 2018 to effect the Reincorporation: (i) a certificate of conversion with the Texas Secretary of State; (ii) a certificate of conversion with the Delaware Secretary of State; and (iii) a certificate of incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State. Pursuant to the plan of conversion, we also adopted new bylaws, which became effective with the Reincorporation. The Reincorporation was approved by our stockholders at our annual meeting on May 14, 2018. Immediately following the Reincorporation, we eliminated our holding company structure by merging our wholly-owned subsidiary Private Acer with and into the Company (the “Subsidiary Merger”). The Company was the surviving corporation in connection with the Subsidiary Merger. As the Delaware certificate of incorporation used the placeholder name of “Acer Reincorporation, Inc.” due to “Acer Therapeutics Inc.” already being in existence in Delaware as Private Acer, in connection with the Subsidiary Merger the Company changed its name to “Acer Therapeutics Inc.” pursuant to a certificate of ownership and merger filed with the Delaware 
 25

Secretary of State on May 15, 2018. As a result of the Reincorporation, the par value our preferred stock was changed from no par value to $0.0001 and the par value of our common stock was reduced to $0.0001 from $0.01.
