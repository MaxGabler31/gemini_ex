 Business Strategy
 Focus on Regulated Business-to-Business Operations
 We focus on providing business-to-business services in areas of operations that are highly regulated.  By helping our customers maintain compliance with complex regulations, we protect people and brands, promote health, and safeguard the environment.  Governmental legislation and regulation increasingly requires the proper handling and disposal of items such as medical waste, hazardous waste, pharmaceutical waste, and personal and confidential information.  Regulated waste can be defined as any material with government-imposed guidelines for handling the material for transportation or disposal. Medical waste, such as needles, syringes, gloves, cultures and potentially infectious agents, blood and blood products, can potentially cause an infectious disease.  Hazardous waste is designated and governed by federal and local environmental protection agencies but generally includes waste that is considered dangerous or potentially harmful to our health or the environment.  Hazardous wastes can be liquids, solids, gases, or sludge.  Pharmaceutical waste may be hazardous or nonhazardous and consists of expired, recalled, or otherwise unused pharmaceuticals.  Personal and confidential information includes documents and e-media containing protected healthcare information, financial information, or other confidential information.  Additionally, the regulatory environment related to promoting overall health and protecting consumers from unsafe products continues to increase.
Focus on the Small Customer with Recurring Service Needs
 We also focus on serving smaller businesses which often have an even greater need for support with compliance matters since they tend to lack the specialized staff that is found at larger businesses.  With a small business, regulatory and compliance matters are often managed by a business owner, office manager, or facility supervisor who manage multiple functions for the organization and often lack the time and resources to properly investigate and comply with a wide range of regulations that may impact

their operations.  In response to this need of small businesses, we developed comprehensive and customizable services to accommodate varying customer requirements.  This business strategy has guided us as we have expanded into additional service offerings including hazardous or pharmaceutical waste management, communication services, and secure information destruction.
 Organic Growth
 As a leading provider in regulated and compliance solutions, we continue to focus on enhancing our service offerings and platforms to exceed customer expectations.  We have developed a strong and loyal customer base, with, we believe, a revenue retention rate of approximately 90% (based on our internal customer attrition analysis), and have been able to leverage these customer relationships to provide additional services.  Our growth strategy focuses on selling additional services to existing customers as well as securing new customer relationships.
Growth through Acquisition
 The various regulated waste and compliance services that we provide tend to be in highly fragmented industries.  We have proven that acquisitions are a steady and efficient way to scale operations, build critical customer density for transportation and treatment operations, and enter new markets or geographies, as well as provide opportunity to introduce our additional services to the acquired customers.  In our early history, acquisitions were a key strategy to rapidly building our customer base and route density in the United States.  We have been able to expand internationally through acquisition and now operate in 20 different markets outside the U.S.  Over our history, Stericycle has completed 496 acquisitions, with 271 in the United States and 225 internationally.  During 2017, we completed 30 acquisitions.  We expect to continue our acquisition strategy, remaining focused on small, highly accretive, tuck-in acquisitions that broaden our various service capabilities while creating value for our shareholders.
Business Transformation
 Stericycle is focused on driving long-term growth, profitability and delivering enhanced shareholder value.  As part of our business strategy, in the third quarter of 2017, we initiated a comprehensive multiyear Business Transformation with the objective to improve long-term operational and financial performance.  The Business Transformation is based on a strategic vision to build a best-in-class enterprise performance management (“EPM”) operating model and includes streamlining our portfolio, realigning our processes and organizational structure to drive efficiency, and implementing an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. 
 Key initiatives of the Business Transformation include:
  
• | Portfolio Rationalization: Executing on a comprehensive review of the Company’s global service lines to identify and pursue the divestiture of non-strategic assets. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Operational Optimization: Standardizing route planning logistics, modernizing field operations, and driving network efficiency across facilities. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Organizational Excellence and Efficiency: Redesigning the Company’s organizational structure to optimize resources and align around a global shared business services model. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercial Excellence: Aligning our sales and service organizations around the customer, standardizing our customer relationship management process, and expanding customer self-service options. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strategic Sourcing: Reducing spend through global procure-to-pay processes and leveraging organizational scale. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implementation of the Business Transformation began in 2017 with the identification and validation of key transformational opportunities as well as an organizational restructuring which occurred during the fourth quarter.  Execution of the Business Transformation is expected to continue through 2022 with the implementation of a best-in-class system in the U.S. as a significant milestone for 2020 with the international roll-out the following year.

 Market Size and Growth Potential
 We provide a wide range of services across multiple market segments and industries.  We believe the size of the global market for the services we provide, in the geographies we currently operate in, is expected to be approximately $38 billion in 2018.  Industry growth is driven by a number of factors, including:

• | Aging Population: The average age of the population in the countries where we operate is rising. As people age, they typically require more medical attention and a wider variety of tests, procedures and medications, leading to an increase in the quantity of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste, and pharmaceutical waste, as well as an increase in confidential healthcare records requiring secure destruction. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pressure to Reduce Healthcare Costs While Improving Outcomes: The healthcare industry is under pressure to reduce costs and at the same time improve healthcare outcomes for patients served. By outsourcing services not directly tied to the delivery of healthcare services, these organizations can potentially reduce costs and improve staff efficiencies. By leveraging third party experts, healthcare organizations may also limit their potential liability for regulatory compliance. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enforcement of Regulations: Enforcement of regulations relating to the management of regulated waste and protected information is increasing. Penalties for violations can be costly and high profile, thereby impacting a business’ overall reputation. Greater enforcement combined with higher penalties results in more compliance and a corresponding increase in potential customers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety and Security Regulation: We believe that many businesses that are not currently using third party regulated waste management, secure information destruction, or recall and communication services are unaware either of the need for proper training of employees or of the regulatory requirements. Similarly, many businesses find that the proper handling of expired or recalled products requires an expertise and efficient processes that they lack. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased Business Focus on Sustainability: Businesses large and small are continuing to realize that the focus on sustainability is now essential to operating efficiently and meeting the increasing demands of customers for environmental responsibility. Such pressures are driving proper disposal of pharmaceuticals, recycling efforts, creative disposal efforts for unused inventory, shred-all policies for paper, and other initiatives supported by our services. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regulation of Privacy and Information Security and Concerns over Data Breaches: The continued development and growth of the secure information destruction industry has been driven, in part, by the need for compliance with increasing government regulation with respect to privacy and information security. These regulations take different forms, with some requiring organizations to establish reasonable measures to protect against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use and disclosure, and others imposing data retention requirements that require businesses to destroy or render anonymous personal information when it’s no longer required for a legal or legitimate business

purpose. Secure information destruction services are increasingly a standard measure that organizations use to meet their legal safeguarding and retention requirements. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Market Expansion due to Increased Outsourcing: In regard to secure information destruction services and communication services, significant market growth is expected to come from increased reliance on outsourced service providers. Many small businesses currently do not use services or manage these needs with internal resources and solutions. Opportunity exists to convert these businesses as the trend to outsource support services continues. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fragmented Markets: The industries in which we operate are highly fragmented with numerous small competitors operating within a limited geographic area and with a narrow focus on a specific service. Opportunities exist to drive efficiencies by consolidating operations. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | International Market Development: The medical waste, hazardous waste, and secure information destruction regulations in certain international markets are at an early stage of development relative to North America and Europe. As emerging markets continue to advance their healthcare practices, environmental controls, and data privacy regulations, we expect to see further demand for our services on a global scale.

Regulated Waste and Compliance Service Operations
 Collection and Transportation
 The collection process for regulated waste streams begins at the customer location with segregation.  To assure regulatory compliance, we will not accept material from customers unless it complies with our waste acceptance protocols and is properly stored or packaged in containers that we have either supplied or approved.
 Our fleet of vehicles then collects containers at the customer location.  The majority of collected waste is then transported directly to one of our processing facilities or to one of our transfer stations until it’s transported to a processing facility.  Our use of transfer stations in a "hub and spoke" configuration improves the efficiency of our collection and transportation operations by expanding the geographic area that a particular processing facility can serve, thereby increasing the utilization of the facility and the volume of waste that it processes.

Processing and Disposal of Regulated Medical Waste
 Upon arrival at a processing facility, containers or boxes of regulated waste undergo a quality control process to verify that they do not contain any unacceptable substances. Any container or box that is discovered to contain unacceptable waste goes through a corrective action process which could include redirecting the waste, returning the waste to the customer, and/or notifying the appropriate regulatory authorities. From there, regulated medical waste is processed using one of several treatments or processing technologies, predominantly at one of our wholly-owned facilities:

• | Autoclaving: Autoclaving is the primary method of medical waste treatment. This process relies on steam at high temperature and pressure to kill pathogens and render materials non-infectious. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Alternative technologies: We use a number of different non-incineration alternatives to autoclaves, predominantly outside of the U.S. The processes used by these technologies are effectively the same with the regulated waste heated to a specified temperature for a required time to kill the pathogens. This is not always under pressure. Depending on local requirements, the waste may be shredded before or after treatment to render it unrecognizable. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Incineration: Incineration burns regulated waste at elevated temperatures and reduces it to ash. Incineration reduces the volume of waste, and it is the recommended treatment and disposal option for some types of regulated waste such as anatomical waste, residues from chemotherapy procedures and non-hazardous pharmaceutical waste. Air emissions from incinerators can contain certain byproducts that are subject to federal, state, and in some cases, local regulation. In some circumstances, the ash byproduct of incineration may be regulated. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Upon completion of the particular process, the resulting waste or incinerator ash is transported for disposal in a landfill owned by unaffiliated third parties.  In some countries, where permitted by regulation, the treated waste is recovered, including recovery as fuel, in waste-to-energy processes.
 Processing and Disposal of Hazardous Wastes
 Our technicians receive hazardous wastes either as expired goods requiring deconstruction or as defined hazardous wastes.  Expired goods are deconstructed to recover metals and plastics for recycling thereby minimizing the total volume of waste disposed of as hazardous waste.  Materials that are predefined as hazardous upon collection are bulked together or consolidated at treatment storage and disposal facilities for more efficient transport to the final disposal or processing destination.  Whenever possible, we seek sustainable solutions for managing materials including alternative uses, recovery processes, recycling options, fuel blending, or energy recovery.  When sustainable options do not exist, these wastes are sent to third parties for incineration, landfill or water treatment.
Destruction and Recycling of Secure Information
 If not shredded on site in a Shred-it truck with proprietary information destruction technology, documents are sent to a shredding facility for secure destruction.  Documents are cross-cut shredded and then baled to be sold as sorted office paper (“SOP”) for recycling.
Communication Solutions and Expert Solutions Business Overview
 Our Communication Solutions service line provides a broad range of live voice or automated services to help our customers keep in touch with their patients and clients.  Our team serves as a client representative providing answering services, appointment scheduling or reminders, event registration, and other activities.  Providing these solutions requires sophisticated information management systems to redirect calls, store and quickly retrieve live voice protocols or client data, send automated communications, or provide easily accessible reporting and activity details to our customers.  Beyond the

information management system infrastructure, call center staffing and education levels are critical to success.  We leverage sophisticated workflow analysis and staffing tools to ensure appropriate resources are in place in order to handle call volumes quickly and consistently across our multiple call centers during peak volumes.
 Our Expert Solutions service line acts as a business partner to protect our client’s customers and to protect our client’s brands.  We specialize in partnering with automotive, food/beverage, medical device, pharmaceutical, consumer goods manufacturers and retailers to guide them through critical recalls, retrievals, or audit processes to ensure brand protection.  Services could include notification services to impacted customers, call center services to support a recall or retrieval, removing impacted product from distribution, processing recalled product and supporting remedy requirements, and compliance reporting.  These solutions are highly customized based on the product being recalled or retrieved and the specific needs of the client.
 Competition
 The industries and markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and barriers to entry are low.  Our competitors consist of many different types of service providers, including national, regional and local companies.  In the regulated waste and secure information destruction industries, another major source of competition is on-site treatment.  For regulated medical waste, some large-quantity generators, particularly hospitals, may choose an onsite autoclave or other treatment process.  For secure information destruction, many businesses may choose to use small, on-site shredders for their documents.  Similarly, customers could handle recalls or communication needs internally.
 In addition, we face potential competition from businesses that are attempting to commercialize a wide range of technologies that directly or indirectly reduce the need for regulated medical waste, hazardous waste or secure information destruction services.
 Governmental Regulation
 The regulated medical waste, hazardous waste, secure information destruction, and recall industries are subject to numerous regulations.  In many countries there are multiple regulatory agencies at the local and national level that affect our customers or our services.  This regulatory framework imposes a variety of compliance requirements, including requirements to obtain and maintain government permits.  We maintain numerous governmental permits, registrations, and licenses to conduct our business in the jurisdictions in which we operate.  Our permits vary by jurisdiction based upon our activities within that jurisdiction and on the applicable laws and regulations of that jurisdiction.  These permits grant us the authority, among other things:

• | to construct and operate collection, transfer and processing facilities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to transport regulated waste within and between relevant jurisdictions; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to handle particular regulated substances.
--+-------------------------------------------

 Our permits must be periodically renewed and are subject to modification or revocation by the issuing authority.  Periodic renewals are subject to public participation and can lead to additional regulatory oversight.  We are also subject to regulations that govern the definition, generation, segregation, handling, packaging, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of regulated waste.  In addition, we are subject to extensive regulations to ensure public and employee health and safety at the federal, state and local levels.

U.S. Federal and Foreign Regulation
 We are subject to substantial regulations enacted and enforced by the U.S. government and by the governments of the foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct regulated waste and secure information destruction operations.  The regulatory requirements with which we must comply vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  The laws governing our domestic and international operations generally consist of statutes, legislation and regulations concerning environmental protection, employee health and welfare, transportation, the use of the mail, ethical business conduct, and proper handling and management of regulated waste streams, controlled substances and personal and confidential information.
 Environmental Protection
 Certain service lines within our business are subject to extensive and evolving environmental regulations in all of the geographies in which we operate.  Generally, the environmental laws we are subject to regulate the handling, transporting, and disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment, the discharge of pollutants into streams, rivers, groundwater and other surface waters, and the emission of pollutants into the air.  The principal environmental laws that govern our operations in the U.S. are state environmental regulatory agencies as they provide the specific legislative and or regulatory frameworks which require the management and treatment of regulated medical waste.  Additionally, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 ("RCRA"), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"), and the Clean Air Act of 1970 are the federal regulations that affect management of certain aspects of regulated medical waste and all RCRA hazardous wastes.  CERCLA and state laws similar to it may impose strict, joint and several liabilities on the current and former owners and operators of facilities from which release of hazardous substances has occurred and on the generators and transporters of the hazardous substances that come to be located at these facilities.  The ten incinerators at seven facilities we currently operate in the U.S. must comply with the emissions standards imposed by the applicable states permitting authorities pursuant to regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act as well as state and/or municipal waste permit requirements.
 Examples of environmental laws applicable to our international operations include the Waste Framework Directive, Environmental Liabilities Directive, Industrial Emissions Directive and the Shipments of Waste Regulations in the European Union ("EU"), Ley 154 (Residuos Patogenicos) in Argentina, Lei 12.305/2010 (Lei Ordinária) Institui A Política Nacional De Resíduos Sólidos in Brazil, and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and related regulations in Canada.  Additional environmental laws at the federal and/or local levels apply to regulated waste management in other markets in which we conduct business.
 Employee Health and Welfare
 We are subject to numerous regulations promulgated to protect and promote worker health and welfare through the implementation and enforcement of standards designed to prevent illness, injury and death in the workplace.  The primary federal laws relating to employee health and welfare applicable to our business in the U.S. are in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 ("OSHA"), which establishes specific employer responsibilities including engineering controls, administrative controls, training, policies and programs complying with the regulations and ultimately recordkeeping and reporting, all in an effort to ensure a safe workplace.  Various OSHA standards apply to almost all aspects of our operations and govern such matters as exposure to blood borne pathogens, hazard communication, personal protective equipment, etc.
 Employee health and welfare laws governing our business in global jurisdictions include examples such as the European Framework Directive on Safety and Health at Work (Directive 89/391 EEC), and various

provisions of the Canada Labour Code and related occupational safety and health regulations in the provinces and territories of Canada.
 Transportation
 Various laws regulating the transportation of waste and other potentially hazardous materials also apply to the services we provide.  In the U.S., the Department of Transportation ("DOT") has promulgated regulations which deal with two different aspects of transportation: hazardous materials transport and safety in transportation.  These regulations are defined within the Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ("FMCSA").  These federal requirements plus additional state requirements are closely monitored internally.  Due to our fleet size we are regularly subject to road side inspections.  These inspections have a cumulative effect on our compliance history and require us to remain in good standing so as not to jeopardize our permits.
 Examples of transportation laws we must comply with internationally include the Directive on the Inland Transportation of Dangerous Goods in the EU and the Transport of Dangerous Goods Act and related regulations in Canada, and globally the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code and the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations.
 Document Management
 Numerous laws and regulations require proper protection of confidential customer information by business parties that have access to such information.  In the U.S., the most commonly cited regulations include the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act (“FACTA”) Final Disposal Rule, the FACTA Red Flag Rule, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) Privacy Rule, and the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (“GLBA”).  Furthermore the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) provides the framework for data privacy and data protection for companies that do business in Europe.
 For the transportation of secure information for destruction, we are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation as a commercial motor carrier.  The processes for the destruction of secure information destruction processes are not regulated by any government agency.  However, the National Association of Information Destruction (“NAID”) maintains a certification to ensure that destruction processes support the needs of organizations to meet laws and regulations relating to the protection of confidential information.  We currently hold the NAID AAA Certification.  Further, the Payment Card Industry ("PCI") Security Standards Council has developed Data Security Standards which are imposed upon merchants utilizing credit cards and require destruction of documents and media in accordance with their standards.
 Ethical Business Conduct
 Various international regulations governing ethical business practices apply to our business, including but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act (“Bribery Act”), and the Brazilian Clean Companies Act.  These laws may apply to our business on both a global and local basis, and ban unethical behavior such as the payment of bribes to government officials for the purpose of gaining an improper business advantage, improper maintenance of the company’s books and records, as well as other financial transparency requirements.
 Use of the Mail
 United States Postal Service ("USPS") has its own set of specific regulations defined in Publication 52 which governs the use of the postal system for mailing of hazardous, restricted and perishable materials.  More specifically, mailback management offerings for sharps, medical waste, and pharmaceutical wastes, require us to obtain and maintain authorization permits from the USPS.  We have obtained permits from the USPS to conduct our "mail-back" programs which provide a convenient service for customers who

need such a service with approved containers for "sharps" (needles, knives, broken glass and the like) or other regulated wastes to be sent directly to a treatment facility.
 Controlled Substances
 Our service offerings for the recall, return and destruction of controlled substance pharmaceuticals are subject to numerous laws and regulations under various international federal agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") in the US.  These regulations apply to both the closed loop management of controlled substances as well as the return of unused controlled substances from consumers.  These regulations typically require facilities to obtain a registration of license and meet certain criteria in order to collect, process, and dispose of controlled substances.  The regulations have very strict requirements for the management of employees, the type of security within facilities, recordkeeping, and the reporting of all controlled substances managed at the facility.  Much like permitting, the registration must be updated regularly and subjects us to inspection and enforcement.
 U.S. and Foreign Local Regulation
 We conduct business in all 50 states and Puerto Rico.  Because the federal EPA does not promulgate regulations for regulated medical waste at a national level, each state has its own regulations related to the handling, treatment and storage of regulated medical waste.  Many states have followed requirements similar to the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 or have placed medical waste regulations under solid waste regulations.  Hazardous waste in the U.S. is regulated under the RCRA.  In addition, certain states may have their own regulations for handling, treatment and storage of hazardous wastes.  Regulated garbage (sometimes referred to as “APHIS waste” taken from the Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service) is another area of regulatory requirements we are subject to pursuant to regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") and Customers and Border Patrol.  The USDA typically inspects our facilities receiving such APHIS waste on a quarterly basis.
 In each state where we operate a processing facility or a transfer station, we are required to comply with varying state and local laws and regulations which may also require a specific operating plan.  In addition, many local governments have ordinances and regulations, such as zoning or wastewater regulations that affect our operations.  Similarly, our international operations are subject to regulations enacted and enforced at the provincial, municipal, and local levels of government in addition to the national regulations with which we must comply.
 Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Rights
 With the acquisition of Shred-it, we hold patents in the U.S. for a three-staged shredder with patent applications pending in Canada and Europe.  We also hold patents in the U.S., Canada, and Europe for Securshield, proprietary locks for shredding containers.
 We own federal registrations for a number of trademarks/servicemarks including Stericycle®, Steri-Safe®, Stericycle ExpertRECALL®, Sustainable Solutions®, LiveAnswer®, Shred-it®, Securit®, Community Shred-it®, Making Sure it’s Secure®, and our company logo service mark consisting of a nine-circle design.  We also hold international registrations for Stericycle, the nine-circle design used in our logo, and the Shred-it name and design.
