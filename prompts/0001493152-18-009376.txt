Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
Unless otherwise provided in this Annual Report, references to the “Company,” “we,” “us”, and “our” refer to Vitality Biopharma, Inc., a Nevada corporation formed on June 29, 2007 and formerly known as Legend Mining Inc. On October 10, 2011, we completed a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Stevia First Corp., whereby we changed our name from “Legend Mining Inc.” to “Stevia First Corp.” On July 15, 2016, our Board of Directors and shareholders approved a name change to Vitality Biopharma, Inc.
 
Vitality Biopharma is unlocking the power of cannabinoids for the treatment of serious neurological and inflammatory disorders.
 
We hold exclusive worldwide intellectual property and commercialization rights to a new class of cannabinoid pharmaceutical candidates known as cannabosides. This class of compounds includes VBX-100, a prodrug of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which enables targeted delivery of THC to the gastrointestinal tract without any resulting drug psychoactivity or intoxication.
 
Cannabosides are cannabinoid glycoside “prodrugs,” which means that they are medications or compounds that, after administration, are converted within the body into a pharmacologically active drug. Because there often already exists independent verification of the active drug’s safety and efficacy, as is the case with THC, which has been FDA-approved as a pharmaceutical since 1985, prodrugs may receive regulatory and marketing approvals more quickly than others. At the same time, a prodrug can have many commercial advantages, including that they can be proprietary and patentable compositions of matter, unlike cannabinoids themselves, or older pharmaceutical formulations where patent protection has already expired.
 
Our most advanced drug candidate, VBX-100, is a prodrug of THC, which was first approved as a pharmaceutical by the FDA in 1985 under the brand name MARINOLTM and that is known by the generic drug name of dronabinol. VBX-100 enables targeting or restriction of THC to the gastrointestinal tract, thereby eliminating or avoiding the psychoactive or intoxicating effects that occur when THC enters the bloodstream and brain. VBX-100 may enable more widespread use of THC for treatment of gastrointestinal conditions as well as its use in many patient populations for whom treatment today with THC is not generally recommended, including children, patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and patients with a history or high risk of mental illness.
 
VBX-100 is being developed for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), C. difficile-associated diarrhea and colitis (CDAC), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and narcotic bowel syndrome (NBS), a severe form of opiate-induced abdominal pain.
 
For IBD, which includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, there have been independently-conducted preclinical and clinical studies that have demonstrated the benefit of cannabinoids. Independently-run retrospective clinical studies have found that in 56 patients who used cannabinoids with IBD that 83.9% of patients reported improvement in abdominal pain, and 76.8% of patients reported improvement in abdominal cramping. In addition, in a prospective trial that was independently-managed and placebo-controlled, it was found that 45% of Crohn’s disease patients achieved remission after 8 weeks of treatment. Patients reported improvements in sleep and appetite with no significant side effects and some patients were able to eliminate use of corticosteroids and opiate pain medications. Patients experienced benefits with cannabis treatment despite being non-responders to conventional therapies, such as corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and TNF-alpha inhibitors. VBX-100 may enable treatment of drug-resistant forms of IBD without any psychoactivity and also without the adverse effects of alternative IBD therapies, many of which today suppress the immune system throughout the body and can increase the risk of infections or cancer.
 
A key part of our strategy will be to take advantage of a more efficient Food & Drug Administration (FDA) review and approval process that is available for prodrugs, which reduces the need for large and expensive clinical trials. Expedited regulatory processes may be available for our cannabosides because in the U.S. and internationally there have already been many independent preclinical and clinical studies completed using THC, and so existing clinical data may be submitted to drug regulatory agencies as supporting evidence of our compounds’ safety.

We aim to develop and approve our pharmaceutical candidates using a low-risk regulatory strategy that is available for prodrugs, and to amplify the benefits that have been seen in independent, early-stage clinical trials and preclinical studies describing the use of cannabinoids for treatment of neurological and inflammatory conditions. Our focus is especially on eliminating well known side effects of existing therapies, and on treating conditions known to involve the endocannabinoid system and the gastrointestinal tract.
 
Our primary operations are based in Yuba City, California, where we originally developed our proprietary bioprocessing methods. The Company’s research and development facilities include laboratories and a manufacturing suite that will be used for pharmaceutical-grade production of drug material for clinical trials. These facilities and the company’s operations involving handling and use of controlled substances have been registered with and authorized by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) as well as the Research Advisory Panel of California, a part of the State of California’s Department of Justice.
 
Product Pipeline 
 
We have produced more than 25 novel cannabosides so far and have patent applications that include composition of matter claims for prodrugs of cannabinoids that have been studied extensively in clinical trials worldwide, including THC and cannabidiol (CBD). Upon successful patent prosecution, protection would extend until 2035 and be available in all major markets worldwide. In addition, we have filed patent applications that seek to protect more broad claims on novel vanilloid glycoside compounds that target TRPV receptors for mediating pain relief, methods of use for TRPV1 agonists to effect neural repair, and based on findings in early 2017, for drug compositions and methods to use cannabinoids to treat gut dysbiosis and drug-resistant C.difficile infections, which colonize the large intestine.
 
Cannaboside prodrugs may deliver a variety of benefits over existing cannabinoid therapies, including:
 

1. | Administration of cannabinoids in a convenient oral formulation; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Targeted delivery of cannabinoids without any psychoactivity or intoxication, which can be achieved through gut-restricted prodrugs that are released in the colon or large intestine and that avoid entry into the bloodstream or brain; 
3. | Improved stability, preventing degradation or drug metabolism, enabling larger and more reliable doses of cannabinoids to be delivered to the site of disease; and 
4. | Delayed release, enabling long-lasting and overnight relief for patients, rather than having to administer treatment repeatedly throughout the day and requiring additional sleep aids. 

 
VBX-100 is an oral cannaboside and a prodrug of THC, or dronabinol, which was first approved by the US FDA in 1985. MARINOLTM is an approved version of dronabinol that is indicated for treatment of anorexia and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. VBX-100 is targeted or restricted to the gastrointestinal tract, so it could eliminate the psychoactive effects of THC, which may enable widespread adult use of THC for treatment of gastrointestinal conditions as well as use in patient populations where use of THC is currently limited or avoided, including for treatment of pediatric conditions or for treatment of patients with a history of mental illness. VBX-100 is intended primarily for acute or short-term use, such as for treatment regimens to induce remission of disease flares that occur in pediatric Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, or for use to relieve severe abdominal pain while narcotic bowel syndrome patients reduce or eliminate use of opioid painkillers.
 
VBX-210 is an oral cannaboside formulation being investigated in preclinical studies for treatment of gastrointestinal conditions. VBX-210 is intended primarily for chronic or long-term use (greater than 6 months per year), including long-term management of irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pain, prevention of colorectal cancer, or maintaining remission of inflammatory bowel disease. We are developing additional cannabinoid product formulations that are intended to provide relief of refractory pain in patients using cannabinoids as an alternative to opioid painkillers, as well as formulations intended to improve the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder.

For each of the pharmaceutical candidates in our pipeline, the active cannabinoid pharmaceutical agents have been independently approved by regulatory bodies and there is extensive clinical data already available related to drug safety and effectiveness. Because of this, we will in general benefit from the increased familiarity of clinical investigators and regulators with these compounds, which may enable abbreviated paths towards clinical testing and eventual approval of our pharmaceutical products.
 
Our Operations 
 
We believe that our long-term commercial success and profit potential depends in large part on our ability to develop and advance proprietary cannabinoid prodrugs that are strongly differentiated from both medical cannabis and existing cannabinoid drugs, and to do this more quickly, efficiently and effectively than our competitors. Another critical factor that will determine our success is our ability to obtain and enforce patents, maintain protection of trade secrets, and operate our business without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. As a result, we are dedicated to the continued development and protection of our intellectual property portfolio.
 
We developed internally and hold exclusive worldwide intellectual property rights related to two U.S. patent applications filed in September and October 2015, titled “Cannabinoid Glycoside Prodrugs and Methods of Synthesis.” In September 2016, an expanded international application was filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty system, which includes 79 patent claims to almost 200 individual compounds, including but not limited to prodrugs of THC and CBD. In March and April 2018, applications were filed for national and regional prosecution in major pharmaceutical markets worldwide including the U.S., Europe, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, China, and Brazil. For more information, see the “Intellectual Property” section below.
 
Short Term Development Targets 
 
We plan to complete all necessary preclinical studies for VBX-100 and to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in the second half of 2018. This first-in-man clinical study will focus primarily on evaluating the clinical pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of VBX-100 in healthy volunteers. Additional endpoints may be analyzed to examine the effects of VBX-100 on GI motility, intestinal permeability, and on the human microbiome. The Phase 1 first-in-human trial is intended to provide safety data sufficient for us to initiate multiple Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical studies in 2019, including for treatment of IBD and IBS. We plan to conduct additional preclinical studies on VBX-100 and our other pharmaceutical candidates, as well as sponsor observational clinical studies of cannabinoids for new treatment indications including prevention of colorectal cancer, treatment of refractory pain (opioid substitution therapy), and treatment of autism spectrum disorder.

Additional Operations 
 
Our glycosylation technology was originally developed in order to improve the taste and yield of stevia sweeteners derived from the stevia plant. We have an intellectual property portfolio related to stevia, as well as commercial operations related to the manufacture and sale of research products that commenced in 2014. We intend to sustain these operations and technologies in a manner that is cash-flow neutral or better and to commercialize the primarily through new out-licensing arrangements or strategic partnerships.
Glycosylation Technology for Prodrug Development
 
The process of adding one or more glucose or sugar molecules to compounds is called glycosylation, and it has recently become appreciated within the pharmaceutical industry that glycosylation of small molecules can act to generate novel natural product libraries with improved drug properties. For instance, attaching a glucose or sugar molecule to a compound that is typically found without one, known as an aglycone, will often make the product far more water-soluble and change its bioavailability. In addition, glycosylation can enable the new compounds, known as glycosides, to act as prodrugs that achieve targeted delivery of bioactive compounds to the gastrointestinal tract.
 
A prodrug is a medication or compound that, after administration, is metabolized (i.e., converted within the body) into a pharmacologically active drug. Prodrugs are often designed to improve bioavailability of a drug, improve patent life, reduce off-target effects, or overcome other known challenges or drawbacks of existing medications.
 
In the case of glycoside prodrugs, they can enable targeted delivery of compounds to the colon or intestinal tract. Glycosides are fairly stable and water-soluble compounds, so upon ingestion they remain intact and transit through the upper digestive tract and stomach, i.e. there is reduced loss due to absorption or degradation by stomach acids. Once glycosides reach the lower intestine, or colon, they encounter glycosidase enzymes secreted by gut bacteria that act to cleave the polar sugar (glucose) residue and release the aglycone compound. This enables site-specific delivery of the aglycone, often a more lipophilic (fat-soluble) bioactive compound. The prodrug’s payload is only liberated or released upon contact with glycosidase enzymes, and these enzymes are only found in large quantities within the intestinal tract, as they are secreted by the human intestinal microbiota.
 
Commonly known and ingested glycoside compounds include many flavonoids, or polyphenols, present in fruit and vegetables. Flavonols are the most ubiquitous flavonoids found in foods, and these compounds are typically present in glycosylated form. Fruit often contains 5 or 10 different flavonol glycosides. A single glass of orange juice may contain between 40 and 140 mg of flavanone glycosides. In leafy vegetables such as lettuce and cabbage, the glycoside concentration is more than 10 times higher in the green outer leaves as in the lighter, inner leaves. There are also FDA-approved drugs that are glycosylated, including sennosides, or ex-lax®, an over-the-counter drug that has been sold in the United States since 1906. Sennosides are on the World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system, and exert their effects through targeted delivery of the active pharmaceutical ingredient to the colon over the course of six to 12 hours.

The process for modifying natural products through glycosylation to provide libraries of new molecules that may have more desirable attributes is called glycorandomization, or glycodiversification. Reliable production of glycosylated natural products must be done in a directed way to enable production of purified individual compounds, and to select for those with the most desirable commercial attributes. Chemical synthesis is often used by research and development teams at large pharmaceutical companies to produce libraries of new compounds, however chemical methods of glycosylation are challenging. Newer methods of enzymatic biosynthesis are now emerging in academia and in industry, including those developed by us, which use plant glycosyltransferase enzymes in order to enable routine production of new libraries of glycoside compounds, and to also enable directed production of individual compounds of interest for use within clinical trials.
 
Pharmaceutical Use of Cannabinoids 
 
As of 2016, more than 20 U.S. states representing 87% of the U.S. population have enacted medical cannabis laws to permit treatment for a variety of medical conditions, including at least use of CBD, which is not intoxicating. The approved conditions in certain states including chronic pain, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, wasting disorders, multiple sclerosis and muscle spasticity disorders, glaucoma, cirrhosis, Alzheimer’s disease, nausea, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson’s disease, HIV/AIDS, Huntington’s disease, and more. A concern with the increasing use of medical cannabis is that patients and physicians are unable to know the precise chemical profile of these products, and that they desire a safe, well-tested pharmaceutical product that can be treated as any other medicine, which includes a list of ingredients, effects, and side effects. Regulatory approval of pharmaceutical cannabinoid products could dramatically increase the chance that health insurance companies would pay for them, and their use could be further legitimized through approval by governments, insurance companies, and physicians.
 
The primary psychoactive component of cannabis is THC, and there are already several approved cannabinoid drugs in the U.S. or internationally that contain THC or an analog of THC, including dronabinol, nabilone, and nabiximols. In 1985, the FDA approved both dronabinol and nabilone, which are synthetic forms of THC, and a THC analog, respectively, which are approved for management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and for wasting conditions related to AIDS and cancer. As of 2014, nabiximols, which is the world’s first prescription medicine made from cannabis extracts, was approved for use in multiple sclerosis in more than 20 countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Australia. Sales of these drugs are currently modest, with U.S. sales of dronabinol capsules in 2014 estimated to be $133 million, according to IMS Health. Data from more than 40 clinical trials of cannabinoids have been published, including evaluations of their use for treatment of chronic pain, neuropathic pain, epilepsy, and muscle spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis.
 
The main non-psychotropic component of cannabis is CBD, which has established antianxiety and antipsychotic effects, acting to mitigate the high from THC, as well as neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. In June 2018, the FDA approved cannabidiol for treatment of Dravet syndrome and also Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, two forms of severe childhood epilepsy. Cannabidiol has demonstrated therapeutic effects in clinical trials for serious neurological conditions including these rare seizure disorders and the FDA has also granted orphan drug designation to an oral liquid formulation of CBD for its use in treating neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. An open-label trial found that CBD reduced seizure frequencies in doses up to 25 mg/kg in multiple drug-resistant forms of epilepsy and seizure disorders. The average age of trial participants was 10 years old and the treatment group that included use of CBD achieved a median reduction in monthly convulsive seizures of nearly 40%, compared to 13% with a placebo, achieving a highly statistically significant effect that was sustained during the treatment period. Independent results of a placebo-controlled trial were published in 2017 by The New England Journal of Medicine and found that cannabidiol was effective in reducing median seizure frequency in Dravet syndrome by more than 50%. CBD was generally well tolerated in these studies, however, somnolence or drowsiness was often reported, and historically is present in 20% or more of these patients.

Studies have shown THC activates both the type-1 (CB1) and type-2 (CB2) cannabinoid receptors. CB2 receptors are overexpressed in inflammatory states and studies have shown that these receptors represent a “braking system” within the body that helps resolve inflammation and many of its symptoms. Independent studies have also shown that cannabinoids can reverse the disordered intestinal permeability that is associated with intestinal inflammation, which may indicate that cannabinoids can promote effective mucosal healing or wound repair following intestinal inflammation and injury.
 
CB1 receptors are the main effectors of the body’s endocannabinoid system, which is involved in most brain and bodily functions, and which as a result has diverse physiological roles. CB1 receptors and the endocannabinoid system more generally have been theorized to represent the cornerstone of the body’s “exostatic” system, which drives the body’s innate sense of hunger and appetite, and which in various ways promotes long-term energy storage. For example, CB1 receptors stimulate appetite directly and also seem to encourage feeding behavior indirectly by reducing feelings of pain, anxiety, and stress. CB1 receptors also promote long-term energy storage through decreasing gut motility, which slows transit of food through the gastrointestinal tract and improves nutrient absorption.
 
Treatment of Inflammatory Conditions including Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis
 
IBD is a chronic autoimmune condition where parts of the digestive system become sore and inflamed. The disease can lead to irreversible damage to the gastrointestinal tract and require surgical removal of the intestine and affected areas. Two major forms of the disease are Crohn’s disease, which can affect any part of the digestive system, and ulcerative colitis, which often affects the rectum and the colon or the large intestine. IBD is a chronic condition, meaning that it is ongoing and typically lasts throughout life in those that are afflicted. The disease is often unpredictable, and there are periods of remission where there are few or no symptoms, which alternate with periods where symptoms are very active and debilitating. The peak incidence of IBD onset occurs between the ages of 15 and 30 years. Clinicians caring for children and adolescents afflicted with pediatric IBD must treat the underlying disease while also monitoring growth, puberty, and cognitive development, while seeking to minimize hospitalization time.
 
Different classes of drugs are used to treat IBD, including anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids, biologics, and immunosuppressants, antibiotics that treat or help prevent bacterial infections that result from gastrointestinal disturbances, and also drugs that relieve the symptoms of the disease such as diarrhea, constipation, and pain. A market research report by Visiongain predicts that in 2017 drug revenues for treatment of IBD will reach $9.6 billion. The ultimate goal of clinical treatment of IBD is to obtain complete disease control and to stop disease progression. This includes remission of disease without use of steroids, normalization of inflammatory markers in the blood, and also healing of the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract, which typically leads to better clinical outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and an improved quality of life.
 
In gastroenterology, cannabis extracts are known for their anti-vomiting, appetite-stimulating, and anti-diarrheal effects, which are thought to be useful for symptomatic relief of IBS and IBD. In a recent survey, more than half of patients with IBD in the U.S. use or have used cannabis (51.3%), and 16.4% of patients had used Cannabis to treat IBD-related symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, loss of appetite, and diarrhea. In an independent observational study of patients with IBD, 83.9% of the 56 patients using cannabis reported improvement in abdominal pain, 76.8% reported improvement in abdominal cramping, and 48.2% reported improvement of joint pain. In a Canadian population in 2011, chronic abdominal pain was reported as the primary reason for self-medication with cannabinoids, including in patients with a history of abdominal surgery. In a 2013 clinical trial of use of cannabis in Crohn’s disease, complete remission was achieved in 5 out of 11 subjects (classified as Crohn’s Disease Activity Index < 150). There were considerable clinical benefits including patients reporting improvements in sleep and appetite, with no significant side effects reported, and certain patients were able to wean themselves off use of corticosteroids and opioid pain medications.

Patients with IBD are at an increased risk of colorectal cancer and opportunistic infections such as C. difficile, often due to the side effects of immunosuppressive therapies used as first and second-line medications. In 2017, the American Cancer Society estimates that 50,260 deaths will occur due to colorectal cancer, making it the 3rd leading cause of cancer-related death for women, and the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related death for men. The most common type of colorectal cancer is adenocarcinoma, which accounts for more than 95% of all cases, and arises from epithelial cells that line the colon and rectum. Clostridium difficile was estimated by the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) to infect almost 500,000 Americans in 2015, and to be directly responsible for 15,000 deaths. C. difficile infections are also linked to sepsis (which some call “blood poisoning”). Sepsis is a disorder where some researchers have now hypothesized the gut plays a central role, where a failure of the integrity of the gut barrier leads to infections throughout the body and can lead to septic shock and multi-organ failure. Each year, sepsis affects more than 750,000 Americans and is responsible for more than 210,000 deaths. Up to 50% of all hospital deaths have been linked to sepsis. It is the most expensive reason for hospitalization in the U.S., where in 2011 the U.S. spent more than $55 million each day in direct healthcare costs treating it. Prevention methods are being developed, which include treatments that may help prevent sepsis altogether, or prevent patient deterioration from sepsis to severe sepsis, or from severe sepsis to septic shock. Independent preclinical studies have already found that a lack of cannabinoid receptors leads to increased incidence of multi-organ failure, and that treatment with cannabinoids can lead to a significant reduction of mortality.
 
Treatment of Enteric Nervous System Disorders including Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Narcotic Bowel Syndrome
 
Independent clinical studies have established that the CB1 cannabinoid receptors present within the gut’s nervous system, known as the enteric nervous system, play a role in the pathophysiology of functional GI disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Specifically, it has been shown that cannabinoids are able to reduce cramping and slow GI motility. CB1 receptors are highly expressed throughout the enteric nervous system, being present on all classes of enteric neurons except inhibitory motor neurons. Genetic variations or polymorphisms of the genes encoding the endocannabinoid system have been shown to be associated with diarrhea-predominant forms of IBS. Use of CB1 receptor agonists such as THC (dronabinol) have been shown in independent clinical studies to inhibit gastric emptying and to slow colonic motility, restricting transit of food through the colon and improving nutrient absorption, which could provide relief for certain forms of IBS.
 
IBS, also known as spastic colon, is a functional gastrointestinal disorder that is characterized by abdominal cramping, diarrhea, constipation, and pain. The term of “spastic colon” refers to the contraction of muscles in the small and large intestines that are often associated with the disorder. IBS has similar symptoms to IBD, including abdominal pain, but the underlying disease process is quite different. IBS is very common, with prevalence in the Western world representing 10-15% of the population, and it has been cited as the most frequent diagnosis in gastroenterology practices in the U.S. Cannabis was one of the first effective interventions in the 19th century for diarrhea resulting from cholera, and extensive reviews have characterized the role of the endocannabinoid system in regulating the GI tract in ways that may benefit IBS, including through effects on inflammation, pain, secretion, and motility.
 
Narcotic bowel syndrome (NBS) is a severe form of opiate-induced abdominal pain. Patients have hypersensitivity to pain and the condition may involve both the enteric and central nervous systems. More than half (58%) of opiate users have reported chronic abdominal pain in independently-conducted clinical studies. NBS is the most severe form of this condition, where abdominal pain paradoxically increases despite continued administration of narcotics to treat the pain. NBS has dire consequences for opiate users, as the quality-of-life has been reported to be worse than patients with quadriplegia. The primary treatment system today is a structured opiate withdrawal program involving a wide variety of medications that act on the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, as well as the gastrointestinal tract. These medications include centrally acting agents for pain, anxiety, depression, and prevention of withdrawal effects, and additional drugs to treat constipation and other GI disorders. Current structured withdrawal or detoxification methods are considered grossly inadequate with no successful long-term treatment options, as evidenced by independent clinical trials where it has been shown that nearly 50% of patients return to opioid use within only three months following treatment.

Competition 
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly active and dynamic, where many companies compete with a strong focus on advancing new technologies and developing proprietary products. We believe our product candidates, technology, scientific acumen, facilities, and additional capabilities provide us with a significant and sustainable competitive advantage, but competition exists today, and new competitors may arise from multiple sources, including especially from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, researchers at non-profit institutions, and government-sponsored researchers. Successfully commercialized products must compete not only with existing therapies, but also with new agents that are currently in development or that may become available in the future.
 
Cannabinoid pharmaceuticals are approved and marketed currently, with more in development, from companies such as GW Pharmaceuticals PLC (“GW Pharma”), Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Arena”), Insys Therapeutics Inc. (“Insys”), Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Zynerba”), and others. GW Pharma is developing botanical extracts including THC, CBD, CBDV, and blends of these compounds, including the current development and marketing of nabiximols, branded as Sativex®, which is approved in more than 20 countries internationally. GW Pharma is also developing cannabidiol, branded as Epidiolex®, for use primarily with epilepsy and rare seizure disorders, and that was approved by the FDA in June 2018. A similar synthetic CBD product is being developed by Insys. Arena is developing a synthetic selective CB2 receptor agonist for treatment of Crohn’s disease pain. Zynerba is developing synthetic forms of THC and CBD, or related prodrugs, which are being developed for use within formulations to be used as a topical gel or transdermal patch, rather than by oral delivery. There is additional competition from companies that supply alternative synthetic cannabinoids, which may influence cannabinoid signaling, as well as from medical marijuana and botanical extracts that are increasingly available to physicians and patients.
 
The global market for drugs treating IBD is predicted by Visiongain to reach $9.6 billion in annual revenues in 2017. The main types of drugs used commonly in IBD include anti-inflammatory drugs, drugs that provide symptomatic relief, and also antibiotics. Drugs used in IBD come in different forms, and may be administered in different ways, including orally, through topical treatments, and also through injectables or infusions in order to obtain an immediate response to a severe inflammatory attack. Primary drugs used in treatment of IBD include aminosalicylic acids, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus, and newer biologics such as infliximab (Remicade®) or adalimumab (Humira®) that target TNF-alpha, a mediator of inflammation. There are a variety of drugs available for treatment of common symptoms such as pain, diarrhea, and constipation. Current drugs that reduce painful abdominal cramps or spasms by relaxing the intestinal muscles are medications such as mebeverine, hyoscine butylbromide, and alverine citrate, which are often recommended for symptomatic relief of IBS but may also be helpful for IBD.
 
Government Regulation 
 
Due to our development of pharmaceutical products, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. Although most regulation described within this document focuses on the United States, the largest market in the world for pharmaceutical products, we anticipate seeking approval for, and marketing of, our products in other countries as well. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope, although there can be meaningful differences.
 
The FDA is the main regulatory body that controls pharmaceutical and biologic drugs in the United States and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”) governs most of the requirements for the development and marketing of our products. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes. A failure to comply explicitly with any requirements during the product development, approval, or post-approval periods may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or an institutional review board, or IRB, of a hold on clinical trials, refusal to approve pending marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, or even civil penalties or criminal prosecution. The FDA also inspects manufacturing facilities periodically in order to ensure adequate compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”), which may require substantial record keeping requirements and equipment maintenance.

Drug Approval Process by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration 
 
The steps required before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally include: completion of preclinical studies of drug safety and efficacy, as well as chemistry, manufacturing, and controls studies to characterize the production of the drug; submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) to support human clinical testing in the United States; approval by an independent research panel before each clinical trial may be initiated; performance of well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed clinical use; submission of an New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the FDA; satisfaction of any periodic reviews or inspections; and FDA review and approval of the NDA. After regulatory approval of a drug is obtained, a company is required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements, which may include ongoing testing, additional clinical trials, and surveillance of the drug’s clinical use in order to continue assess tis overall safety and efficacy profile. In addition, companies with marketed drugs are required to report adverse reactions and manufacturing issues to the FDA, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of its products.
 
The FDA and other federal agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities conducted online. A pharmaceutical product cannot be commercially marketed before it is approved by the FDA. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to its safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the product labeling approved in advance by the FDA. Physicians and other healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for “off-label” uses, which deviate from the specific use described on the product labeling, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on drug manufacturers regarding the ability to market or promote such off-label use.
 
Beyond seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants may apply for an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), and also through an abbreviated 505(b)(2) application. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, same strengths and dosage form, as a listed drug and has been shown through PK testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. 505(b)(2) applications provide for marketing of a drug product that may have the same active ingredients as the listed drug and contains full safety and effectiveness data as an NDA, but at least some of this information comes from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant. Upon approval, depending on the type of drug approved, and the indication it was approved for, it may receive additional periods of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve any alternative versions of the drugs. In addition, the FDA may grant three years of marketing exclusivity for a 505(b)(2) application if the NDA includes reports of clinical studies beyond bioequivalence testing.
 
Additional special programs are available through acts of the FDA, including use of patent term extensions, which can extend the life of a patent as compensation for lost time during the FDA review and approval process, as well as alternative regulatory paths. This includes the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 and the FDA Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, which for example provides for a Breakthrough Therapy Designation. Through obtaining a Breakthrough Therapy Designation, a Company may be able to obtain accelerated approval for one or more drugs if they meet the qualifying criteria, which includes treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and having preliminary clinical evidence that the treatment will provide a substantial improvement over existing therapies.
 
Drug Coverage and Reimbursement by Third-Party Payors 
 
Upon marketing approval, there still remains extensive uncertainty over the ability for any drug to obtain insurance coverage and reimbursement for use of any products from third-party payers within the healthcare system in the United States and internationally. Sales of any products depend upon their acceptance and use by physicians and other healthcare providers, but also their availability from wholesalers and agreement to provide reimbursement from third-party payers, including private health insurance firms, managed care providers, and government health administrative agencies. Any or all of these groups may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA approved drugs for a particular indication. In addition, third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy.

Alternative pricing and drug reimbursement mechanisms exist in other countries. Some jurisdictions may not allow marketing of a drug until market prices have been established. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Countries of the European Union are permitted to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.
 
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on providing cost-effective pharmaceutical treatments. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.
 
Controlled Substance Regulations 
 
We are developing and performing research on compounds that have been classified as “controlled substances” within the Controlled Substances Act, and that are monitored in the United States by the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”). The DEA actively monitors and helps establish procedures that are in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act, and this involves a company having to register itself, and to adhere to certain reporting and security practices in order to prevent and mitigate any loss or mishandling of controlled substances used on the premises. The State of California has similar requirements, and we must maintain registration with a panel with disclosure of planned studies and our practices in order to conduct our operations.
 
The DEA regulates controlled substances using different schedules, where Schedule I substances by definition have high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in the United States and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Schedule I and Schedule II substances are considered to present the highest risk of abuse, and Schedule V substances the lowest risk. THC, CBD, and purified synthetic forms are listed by the DEA as Schedule I substances, although some FDA-approved pharmaceutical versions of these products are now listed as Schedule III substances.
 
A quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. This includes manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much product may be produced in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. This limited aggregate amount is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual manufacturing and procurement quotas.
 
DEA registration is required for any facility that performs research, manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. The DEA typically inspects facilities to review the premises in advance of issuing a formal registration, in order to assess the adequacy of their security and internal controls. Security measures differ based on the specific type of application and controlled substance, but generally include physical control of inventory, surveillance cameras, and ensuring there is no diversion or loss of material through record-keeping and inventory monitoring. Reports must be provided to the DEA on the use of materials, as well as immediate reports of theft, loss, or suspicious activity.
 
Research and Development 
 
During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred $1,897,817 and $893,960 in expenses that were allocated to research and development activities. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Intellectual Property 
 
We developed internally and hold exclusive worldwide rights to intellectual property describing VBX-100 and additional cannabinoid pharmaceutical compounds, as well as methods for their use. In September 2015, October 2015 and July 2016, we filed three U.S. patent applications, titled “Cannabinoid Glycoside Prodrugs and Methods of Synthesis”, including an initial filing and two expanded filings. In September 2016, an expanded international application was filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty system, which includes 79 patent claims to almost 200 individual compounds, including but not limited to prodrugs of THC and CBD. The patent application also includes description of our glycosylation platform, which enables the efficient manufacture of cannabosides and other glycosylated small molecule compounds through enzymatic biosynthesis. In March and April 2018, this application was filed for national and regional prosecution in major pharmaceutical markets worldwide including the U.S., Europe, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, China, and Brazil.

In May 2017, we filed a U.S. patent application titled “Antimicrobial Compositions Comprising Cannabinoids and Methods of Using,” which described compositions and methods of use involving cannabinoids that are able to provide antimicrobial activity including against Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.
 
In June 2015, we filed a U.S. patent application titled “Method for Production and Recycling of UDPG”, which describes methods for recycling and economical production of a key cofactor necessary for biotransformation of steviol and cannabinoids through glycosylation. We previously licensed rights to a U.S. patent application titled, “Compositions and methods for producing steviol and steviol glycosides”, which was related to microbial production of stevia, and terminated this license in May 2016 in favor of pursuing internally developed methods. In March 2016, we were assigned rights to a U.S. provisional patent application titled “Methods for Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis and Demyelinating Disorders” from the Myelin Repair Foundation, which described methods for treating multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases through use of FDA-approved drugs that can be repurposed for their utility in effecting remeylination, a form of nervous system repair or regeneration. In March 2017, we converted this patent application to an international PCT patent application focused on use of TRPV1 agonists for treatment of demyelinating disorders. These drugs along with others including our cannabinoid glycoside prodrugs may be administered in oral or injectable forms.
 
Our internally developed patents now include more than 10 non-provisional applications with PCT and national filings covering novel compositions of matter for cannabinoid prodrugs known as cannabosides, compositions and methods of use for cannabinoids to treat microbial infections, methods for enzymatic biosynthesis, and medical applications of cannabinoid prodrugs. If successful in prosecuting patent claims covering our lead compound VBX-100 and other cannaboside prodrugs, we would obtain patent protection through 2035, which may be extended through patent term adjustments. Patent costs are expensed as incurred.
 
Employees 
 
As of June 26, 2018, we had seven full-time employees, including five dedicated to research and development. We also utilize the services of a network of consultants that contribute on a part-time basis, which gives us access to additional scientists, engineers, and regulatory professionals that assist with our pharmaceutical research and development activities. We expect to increase the number of our employees and contractors as we expand our operations, and the number of employees dedicated to marketing, and sales support as we begin to commercialize additional products and intensify our sales efforts.
Company Information and History
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 29, 2007 as Legend Mining Inc. On October 10, 2011, we completed a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Stevia First Corp., whereby we changed our name from “Legend Mining Inc.” to “Stevia First Corp.” Also on October 10, 2011, we effected a seven (7) for one (1) forward stock split of authorized, issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital was increased from 75,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 to 525,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001, and issued and outstanding shares increased from 7,350,000 to 51,450,000. On July 15, 2016, the holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock and our Board of Directors approved 1) a name change whereby our name was changed from Stevia First Corp. to Vitality Biopharma, Inc., 2) a reverse split of our outstanding common shares whereby each 10 shares of common stock will be exchanged for 1 share of common stock and 3) an increase in the number of shares of authorized common stock from 525,000,000 to 1,000,000,000. These changes became effective on July 20, 2016.
