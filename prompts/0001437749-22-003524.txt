ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General 
 
We are the leading global distributor of pipe, valves and fittings ("PVF") and other infrastructure products and services to diversified energy, industrial and gas utility end-markets. We provide innovative supply chain solutions, technical product expertise and a robust digital platform to customers globally through our leading position across each of our diversified end-markets including the following sectors:

● | gas utilities (storage and distribution of natural gas) 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | downstream, industrial and energy transition (crude oil refining, petrochemical and chemical processing, general industrials and energy transition projects)
● | upstream production (exploration, production and extraction of underground oil and gas) 
● | midstream pipeline (gathering, processing and transmission of oil and gas) 

 
We offer over 250,000 SKUs, including an extensive array of PVF, oilfield supply, valve automation and modification, measurement, instrumentation and other general and specialty products from our global network of over 10,000 suppliers. With over 100 years of experience, we serve approximately 10,000 customers through digital commerce applications and approximately 210 service locations including regional distribution centers, service centers, corporate offices and third party pipe yards, where we often deploy pipe near customer locations.
 
Our customers use the PVF and other infrastructure products that we supply in mission critical process applications that require us to provide a high degree of product knowledge, technical expertise and comprehensive value-added services to our customers. We seek to provide best-in-class service and a one-stop shop for our customers by satisfying the most complex, multi-site needs of many of the largest companies in energy, industrial and gas utility sectors as their primary PVF supplier. We believe the critical role we play in our customers’ supply chain, together with our extensive product and service offerings, broad global presence, customer-linked scalable information systems and efficient distribution capabilities, serve to solidify our long-standing customer relationships and drive our growth. As a result, we have an average relationship of over 25 years with our 25 largest customers.
 
We have made significant strides in increasing the diversification of our end markets over the last few years supporting not only the energy transition but other industrial end markets. Our gas utility business, generating $1 billion in revenue, had the most significant contribution to our revenue improvement in 2021. This business, which is largely independent of oil and gas commodity prices, continues to be our largest sector. Our largest customers are among the leading investors in energy transition projects. As they further rebalance their capital investment away from traditional, carbon-based energy toward alternative sources, we expect to continue to supply them and enhance our product and service offerings to support their changing requirements, including in areas such as carbon capture, utilization and storage, biofuels and offshore wind.

Business Strategy 
 
As a distributor of PVF and other infrastructure products to diversified energy, industrial and gas utility sectors, our strategy is focused on growth, margin enhancement and the development of long-term customer relationships. Our strategic objectives are to:

● | increase our market share by executing preferred supplier contracts with new and existing customers, maintaining a focus on our managed and targeted growth accounts,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | enhance our product and service offerings around our core PVF distribution offerings as well as complementary products, 
● | extend our global platform to major gas utilities, energy and industrial companies that utilize PVF, 
● | provide our products and services to companies engaged in the energy transition, 
● | invest in technology systems and distribution warehouse infrastructure to achieve improved operational excellence, 
● | continue our penetration of electronic interaction with our customers through e-commerce, 
● | safely and sustainably increase our efficiency and lower our cost to serve to enhance our margins, 
● | maintain superior customer service, and 
● | optimize our working capital. 

 
We believe that preferred supplier agreements allow us to better serve our customers’ needs and provide customers with a global platform in which to procure their products. The agreements vary by customer; however, in most cases, we are the preferred supplier, and while there are no minimum purchase requirements, we generally have a larger proportion of the customer’s spending in our product categories when we enter into these agreements.
 
We strive to add scope to these arrangements in various ways including adding customer locations, product lines, inventory management and inventory logistics.
 
We conduct detailed account planning and educate potential customers on the offerings and logistics services we provide. In addition, through digital system integration with our customers and suppliers, we believe transactions with our customers can be more streamlined.
 
Our approach to expanding existing markets and accessing new markets is multifaceted. We seek to optimize our geographic footprint, pursue strategic acquisitions and organic investments and cultivate relationships with our existing customer base. We work with our customers to develop innovative supply chain solutions that enable us to consistently deliver the high-quality products that our customers need when they need them. By being a consistent and reliable supplier, we are able to maintain and grow our market share with both new and existing customers.
 
We maintain a diverse universe of suppliers that allows us to strategically partner with the largest manufacturers of the products we distribute while simultaneously providing our customers access to alternative sources of supply and high-quality products across the entire spectrum of their PVF needs. We continually broaden our product and service offerings and supplier base. Product expansion opportunities include alloy, chrome, stainless products, gaskets, seals, products that prevent the unwanted emission of greenhouse gases, such as methane, and other industrial supply products. We remain focused on products and value-added services such as valves, valve automation and modification, measurement and instrumentation, as well as, high alloy products that command higher margins.
 
Although we have not been active with acquisitions in recent years, our acquisition strategy is focused on those businesses that:
 

● | can increase scale, especially with respect to purchasing and breadth of supply for our customers, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | result in efficiencies in providing our products and services that can reduce the cost to serve our customers, 
● | add services or technology that complement our product offerings, 
● | optimize our geographic footprint to serve energy, industrial or gas utility intensive regions that provide accretive profit opportunities, 
● | expand our product and service offerings, adding breadth and depth to our existing product offerings, such as valves, complementing our existing product offerings such as related measurement and instrumentation products or products that control the unwanted discharge of greenhouse gases like methane, or
● | expand our product and service offerings to new end use sectors. 

 
Where suitable acquisition opportunities are not available in the market, we may choose to grow through organic investment in the current markets we serve or consider expanding into markets that we do not currently serve to further diversify our revenue stream.
 
We invest in information technology (“IT”) systems and service center infrastructure to achieve improved operational excellence and customer service. Our concept of operational excellence leverages standardized business processes to deliver top tier safety performance, a consistent customer experience and a lower overall cost to serve. Our digital transformation strategy is a key component of operational excellence and is designed to add further differentiation to our product and service offerings with an objective to maintain and grow our business with new and existing customers. We continue to develop our digital commerce platform, MRCGO™. From this single portal, our customers have the ability to shop for material, track and expedite orders, research payment options, search for documents and receive support from MRC Global representatives. Through this platform we are able to enhance the customer experience through a broad array of customized digital services while simultaneously lowering our cost to serve by centralizing customer service resources, expanding customer self-service capabilities and routing a greater volume of our business through the regional distribution center (“RDC”) fulfillment model. Where practical and cost effective, we are delivering directly from our RDCs to the customer delivery location, supporting our efforts to consolidate inventory and increase working capital efficiency. Globally, over the last twelve months, 42% of our revenue was generated through e-commerce channels.

Operations 
 
Our distribution network extends throughout the world with a presence in all major oil and natural gas providing regions in the U.S. and western Canada, as well as Europe, Asia, Australasia, and the Middle East. Many of these locations are also strategically located to service gas utilities and industrial customers. Our business is segregated into three geographical operating segments: U.S., Canada and International. These segments represent our business of providing PVF and other infrastructure products and services to the sectors that we serve. Financial information regarding our reportable segments appears in “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Safety.  In our business, safety is of paramount importance to us and to our customers. Unsafe conditions can cause or contribute to injuries, deaths, property damage and pollution that, in turn, can create significant liabilities for which insurance may not always be sufficient. We are also subject to many safety regulatory standards such as those standards that the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (“OSHA”), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and the U.S. Department of Transportation or state or foreign agencies of a similar nature may impose and enforce upon us. Failure to meet those standards can result in fines, penalties or agency actions that can impose additional costs upon our business. For all of these reasons, we and our customers demand high safety standards and practices to prevent the occurrence of unsafe conditions and any resulting harm. Our operations, therefore, focus on the safety of our employees and those with whom we do business. Our safety programs are designed to focus on the highest likely safety risks in our business and to build a culture of safe practices and continuous safety improvement for our employees, our customers and others with whom we do business or otherwise come into contact.
 
Among other safety measures, we track our total recordable incident rate (“TRIR”) and our lost work-day rate (“LWDR”), both per 200,000 hours worked. Our TRIR was 1.09 in 2021. This compares favorably to the 2020 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”) average of 3.5 for wholesalers of metal products. Our LWDR was 0.48 in 2021. This also compares favorably to the BLS average of 2.3 for wholesalers of metal products. In addition, our recordable vehicle incident rate (“RVIR”) has also remained low at 0.39 compared to a peer group average of 1.94 based on the most recent survey that the National Association of Wholesaler Distributors compiled of its members with excess of $1 billion in annual revenue.
 
Products:  We distribute a complete line of PVF products, primarily used in gas utilities and energy and industrial infrastructure applications. The products we distribute are used in the construction, maintenance, repair and overhaul of equipment used in extreme operating conditions such as high pressure, high/low temperatures and highly corrosive and abrasive environments. We are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet the rapid delivery, often same day, requirements of our customers. The breadth and depth of our product and service offerings and our extensive global presence allow us to provide high levels of service to our customers. Due to our broad inventory coverage, we are able to fulfill more orders more quickly, including those with lower volume and specialty items, than we would be able to if we operated on a smaller scale or only at a local or regional level. Key product types are described below:

● | Valves, Automation, Modification, Measurement and Instrumentation. Our product offering includes ball, butterfly, gate, globe, check, diaphragm, needle and plug valves, which are manufactured from cast steel, stainless/alloy steel, forged steel, carbon steel or cast and ductile iron. Valves are generally used in energy and industrial applications to control direction, velocity and pressure of fluids and gases within transmission networks. Other products include lined corrosion resistant piping systems, control valves, valve automation and top work components used for regulating flow and on/off service, measurement products and a wide range of steam and instrumentation products. In addition, we offer a full range of valve modification services to meet customer requirements including valve control extensions, welding, hydrotesting, painting, coating, x-raying and actuation assembly.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Carbon Steel Fittings and Flanges. Carbon steel fittings and flanges include carbon weld fittings, flanges and piping components used primarily to connect piping and valve systems for the transmission of various liquids and gases. Customers use these products across all the industries in which we operate. 
● | Stainless Steel and Alloy Fittings, Flanges and Pipe. Stainless steel and alloy pipe and fittings include stainless, alloy and corrosion resistant pipe, tubing, fittings and flanges. These are used most often in the chemical, refining and power generation industries but are used across all of the sectors in which we operate. Customers principally use alloy products in high-pressure, high-temperature and high-corrosion applications typically seen in process piping applications. 
● | Gas Products. Natural gas distribution products include risers, meters, polyethylene pipe and fittings and various other components and industrial supplies used primarily in the distribution of natural gas to residential and commercial customers. 
● | Line Pipe. Customers typically use carbon line pipe in high-yield, high-stress and abrasive applications such as the gathering and transmission of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGL”). 
● | General Products. General includes oilfield supplies and other industrial products such as mill, tool and safety and electrical supplies. We offer a comprehensive range of oilfield and industrial supplies and completion equipment, including high density polyethylene pipe, fittings and rods. Additionally, we can supply a wide range of specialized production equipment including tanks and separators used in our upstream production sector.

Services: We provide our customers with a comprehensive array of services which we believe result in deeply integrated customer relationships, such as the following:
 

● | product testing | ● | truck stocking 
--+-----------------------------------------------------+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | manufacturer assessments | ● | order consolidation 
● | multiple daily deliveries | ● | product tagging and system interfaces customized to customer 
● | volume purchasing | ● | supplier specifications for tracking and replenishing inventory 
● | inventory and zone store management and warehousing | ● | engineering of control packages 
● | technical support | ● | valve inspection and repair 
● | training | ● | product expediting, tracking and tracing 
● | just-in-time delivery | ● | documentation services, including material test records, assembly drawings and data sheets
● | on-site commissioning | ● | pressure testing 

 
Our self-service portal and system interfaces facilitate digital transaction exchange between our customers’ and our proprietary IT systems. This allows us to interface with our customers’ IT systems with cross-referenced part numbers, customized pricing, customized business to business processes, streamlining the order to cash process making it easier and more efficient to purchase our products. Such services strengthen our position with customers as we become more integrated into their supply chain and we are able to market a “total transaction value” solution rather than individual products.
 
We continue to invest in and expand our comprehensive IT systems. In North America, we operate an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system, enhanced with differentiating distribution and service functionality. In 2017, we completed the transition of our International business to a single ERP platform. These systems, which provide for customer and supplier digital integrations optimizing business to business processes, information exchange and e-commerce applications, including our MRCGO™ platform, further strengthen our ability to provide high levels of service to our customers. Our highly specialized implementation group focuses on the integration of our information systems and implementation of improved business processes with customers during the initiation phase. By maintaining a specialized team, we are able to utilize best practices to implement our technology systems and processes, thereby providing solutions to customers in a more organized, efficient and effective manner. This approach is valuable to large, multi-location customers who have demanding service requirements.
 
As major gas utilities, along with integrated and large independent energy companies have implemented efficiency initiatives to focus on their core business, many of these companies have begun outsourcing certain of their procurement and inventory management requirements. In response to these initiatives and to satisfy customer service requirements, we offer integrated supply services to customers who wish to outsource all or a part of the administrative burden associated with sourcing and managing PVF and other related products. In integrated supply relationships, we offer electronic catalog service through MRCGO™ and often have MRC Global employees on-site full-time at many customer locations. Our integrated supply group offers procurement-related services, physical warehousing services, product quality assurance and inventory ownership and analysis services.
 
For years, in our valve engineering centers, we have designed and constructed assemblies that combine actuators with the valves we sell. In addition, in 2019 we opened a valve engineering and modification center in La Porte, Texas that provides services, primarily to our midstream pipeline customers. At this facility, we modify valves for customer requirements, weld segments of pipe to the intake/outtake openings of large pipeline valves, add extensions to the valve controls while installing actuators to the valve, hydrotest the valves, paint or coat the valves, x-ray the welds and deliver complete valve/actuation assemblies to our customers for field installations.
 
We provide customers with our ValidTorque™ service, whereby we utilize specialized test benches to provide customers with data on the operating characteristics of their valves and actuators. In addition, we have a FastTrack™ service that we provide customers, whereby we supply specified classes of actuated valves in short delivery windows.
 
Suppliers: We source the products we distribute from a global network of over 10,000 suppliers in over 40 countries. We have approximately 100 dedicated supply chain management employees that handle purchasing. Our suppliers benefit from access to our large, diversified customer base and by consolidating customer orders allowing for manufacturing efficiencies. We benefit from stronger purchasing power and preferred vendor programs. Our purchases from our 25 largest suppliers in 2021 approximated 43% of our total purchases, with our single largest supplier constituting approximately 6%. We are the largest customer for many of our suppliers, and we source the majority of the products we distribute directly from the manufacturer. The remainder of the products we distribute are sourced from manufacturer representatives, trading companies and, in some instances, other distributors.
 
We believe our customers and suppliers recognize us as an industry leader in part due to the quality of products we supply and for the formal processes we use to evaluate vendor performance. This vendor assessment process is referred to as the MRC Global Supplier Registration Process, which involves employing individuals who specialize in conducting on-site assessments of our manufacturers and their processes as well as monitoring and evaluating the quality of goods produced. These assessments are aimed at product quality assurance, including all aspects of the manufacturing processes, steel, alloy and material quality, ethical sourcing, product safety and ethical labor practices. The result of this process is the MRC Global approved manufacturer’s listing (“AML”). Products from the manufacturers on this list are supplied across many of the industries we support. Given that many of our largest customers, especially those in our downstream, industrial and energy transition sector, maintain their own formal AML listing, we are recognized as an important source of information sharing with our key customers regarding the results of our on-site assessment. For this reason, together with our commitment to promote high quality products that bring the best overall value to our customers, we often become the preferred provider of AML products to these customers. Many of our customers regularly collaborate with us regarding specific manufacturer performance, our own experience with vendors’ products and the results of our on-site manufacturer assessments. The emphasis that both our customers and suppliers place on the MRC Global AML helps secure our central and critical position in the global PVF supply chain.
 
We utilize a variety of freight carriers in addition to our corporate truck fleet to ensure timely and efficient delivery of our products. With respect to deliveries of products from us to our customers, or our outbound needs, we utilize both our corporate fleet and third-party transportation providers. With respect to shipments of products from suppliers to us, or our inbound needs, we principally use third-party carriers.

Sales and Marketing: We distribute our products to a wide variety of end-users. Our broad inventory offering and distribution network allows us to serve large global customers with consistent, high-quality service that is unrivaled in our industry. Local relationships, depth of inventory, responsive service and timely delivery are critical to the sales process in the PVF distribution industry. Our sales efforts are customer and product driven and provide a system that is more responsive to changing customer and product needs than a traditional, fully centralized structure.
 
Our sales model applies a two-pronged approach to address both regional and national markets. Regional sales teams are based in our core geographic regions and are complemented by a global accounts sales team organized by sector or product expertise and focused on large regional, national or global customers. These sales teams are then supported by groups with additional specific service or product expertise, including integrated supply, valves, valve automation and modification, engineering, procurement and construction projects, corrosion resistant products, pipe, measurement equipment and implementation. Our overall sales force is then internally divided into outside and inside sales forces.
 
Our over 180 account managers and external sales representatives develop relationships with prospective and existing customers in an effort to better understand their needs and to increase the number of our products specified or approved by a given customer. Outside sales representatives may be service center outside sales representatives, who focus on customer relationships in specific geographies, or technical outside sales representatives, who focus on specific products and provide detailed technical support to customers. Internationally, for valve sales, the majority of our sales force is comprised of qualified engineers who are able to meet complex customer requirements, select optimal solutions from a range of products to increase customers’ efficiency and lower total product lifecycle costs.
 
Our inside sales force of over 600 customer service representatives is responsible for processing orders generated by new and existing customers as well as by our outside sales force. The customer service representatives develop order packages based on specific customer needs, interface with manufacturers to determine product availability, ensure on-time delivery and establish pricing of materials and services based on guidelines and predetermined metrics that management establishes.
 
Seasonality: Our business normally experiences mild seasonal effects in the U.S. as demand for the products we distribute is generally higher during the months of August, September and October. Demand for the products we distribute during the months of November and December and early in the year generally tends to be lower due to a lower level of activity near the end of the calendar year in the industry sectors we serve and due to winter weather disruptions. In addition, certain exploration and production (“E&P”) activities, primarily in Canada, typically experience a springtime reduction due to seasonal thaws and regulatory restrictions, limiting the ability of drilling rigs to operate effectively during these periods.
Customers: Our principal customers are companies active in the gas utilities, downstream, industrial and energy transition, upstream production and midstream pipeline sectors. Due to the demanding operating conditions in these sectors, high costs and safety risks associated with equipment failure, customers prefer highly reliable products and vendors with established qualifications, reputation and experience. As our PVF products typically are mission critical and represent a fraction of the total cost of a given project, our customers often place a premium on service and high reliability given the high cost to them of maintenance or project delays. We strive to build long-term relationships with our customers by maintaining our reputation as a supplier of high-quality, reliable products and value-added services and solutions.
 
We have a large customer base of approximately 10,000 customers. No single customer represents more than 10% of our revenue. For many of our largest customers, we are often their primary PVF provider by sector or geography, their largest or second largest supplier in aggregate or, in certain instances, the sole provider for their procurement needs. We believe that many customers for which we are not the exclusive or comprehensive sole source PVF provider will continue to reduce their number of suppliers in an effort to reduce costs and administrative burdens and focus on their core operations. As such, we believe these customers will seek to select PVF distributors with the most extensive product and service offerings and ability to supply customer needs in the geographies where our customers operate. Furthermore, we believe our business will benefit as companies in the energy industry continue to consolidate and the larger, resulting companies look to larger distributors such as ourselves as their sole or primary source PVF provider.
 
Backlog: We determine backlog by the amount of unshipped customer orders, either specific or general in nature, which the customer may revise or cancel in certain instances. The table below details our backlog by segment (in millions):

 | Year Ended December 31, | 
--------------+-------------------------+----
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | | 2019
U.S. | $ | 350 | | $ | 193 | | $ | 301
Canada | | 35 | | | 13 | | | 34 
International | | 135 | | | 134 | | | 174
 | $ | 520 | | $ | 340 | | $ | 509

 
There can be no assurance that the backlog amounts will ultimately be realized as revenue or that we will earn a profit on the backlog of orders, but we expect that substantially all of the sales in our backlog will be realized within 12 months.
 
Competition: We are the leading global PVF distributor to the energy, industrial and gas utility end markets. The broad PVF distribution industry is fragmented and includes large, nationally recognized distributors, major regional distributors and many smaller local distributors. The principal methods of competition include offering prompt local service, fulfillment capability, breadth of product and service offerings, price and total costs to the customer. Our competitors include, among others, large PVF distributors, such as NOW Inc., Ferguson, plc, Van Leeuwen, FloWorks (including Sunbelt Supply Co.), Charbonneau Industries, Score Group, Bakerfield Pipe & Supply, Edgen Murray (a Sumitomo Corporation subsidiary), Elite Supply, Industrial Piping Specialists, RK Supply, Russell Metals, Sooner Pipe (a Marubeni Corporation subsidiary), several regional or product-specific competitors and many local, family-owned and privately held PVF distributors. In addition, most of our suppliers also sell directly to end users.

Human Capital
 Employees. We are a global team in 16 countries dedicated to our customers, our communities and each other. MRC Global employees regularly go out of their way to support each other in times of need, provide excellent service to our customers and uplift the communities where they live and work. 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2,600 employees. Approximately 66% of our employees are in the U.S., 27% are in our International segment, and 7% are in Canada. In the U.S., Norway and Australia, as of December 31, 2021, we had 86 employees that belonged to a union and an additional 160 non-union employees that are covered by union negotiated agreements. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
 Compensation.  We believe that we provide our employees with a competitive compensation within our industry in the form of wage or salary, depending upon the position. In the U.S., we pay our hourly employees at least $15 per hour beginning in their first year of employment and in other countries we pay prevailing wages for our industry. In the U.S., Canada, and Australia, we offer a defined contribution retirement plan and in other countries we offer similar plans or participate in local government retirement schemes. Likewise in the U.S., we offer employees the opportunity to participate in health, dental and vision benefit plans and in other countries our employees either participate in similar plans or in government provided healthcare schemes. For those positions where short-term incentives, such as annual or quarterly bonuses are applicable, we align our incentives with overall financial results. For profit centers, financial incentives often include adjusted EBITDA as a metric that supports our overall financial objectives. For sales personnel, incentives often include gross margin metrics for the employee’s location or unit that also support our overall financial objectives.  While we align overall incentive payout with financial results, many employees are also incentivized on non-financial performance objectives and safety or operational efficiency goals or project objectives. An employee's objectives are usually set at the beginning of each year with the employee's supervisor.
 Employee Development.  MRC Global provides its employees with educational tools and development opportunities to continually improve their talent and skills.
 We maintain an organizational development and learning function with employees who develop and present training along with other subject matter experts inside and outside of the company. Because our workforce is distributed over 160 locations in 16 countries, we also maintain a strong internet-delivered learning management system ("LMS") that has many training modules that can be accessed throughout our company. Many of these training modules include interactive training, so that trainees are engaged as they learn. We require employees to take certain modules on anti-harassment, anti-discrimination, legal compliance, safety and computer security at regular intervals. We provide additional training covering the Company’s proprietary procedures and systems, product knowledge, leadership and management, sales skills, Microsoft Office 365 applications and a wide variety of IT areas. As we are increasing our digital capabilities through our MRCGOTM offering as well as other internal initiatives, we are increasing the development of employees to develop, implement, use and promote these digital platforms. In addition to modules on the Company’s LMS, we provide employees many opportunities to grow their product knowledge through targeted training that the Company, its suppliers or its customers present. We track all of our training, so that every employee has a training record and plan. Our on-boarding process for new employees provides a broad and accelerated understanding of MRC Global’s business and culture. Additionally, all employees establish development goals at the beginning of the year, and we track the progress of these goals through periodic individual development reviews. Finally, we periodically assess our employees’ satisfaction and engagement through regular individual development reviews as well as company-wide surveys that we undertake every few years.
 
MRC Global’s employee development process begins upon hire and at the start of each calendar year by documenting individual goals, both for performance and development. Goals are mutually agreed upon between employee and manager, then reviewed for progress throughout the year. A mid-year review is undertaken, enabling employees to receive individualized feedback regarding goals and development progress in support of year-end success. MRC Global also offers employees with more than six months of service the opportunity to participate in a tuition reimbursement plan for both graduate and undergraduate courses that align with their career objectives within the company up to $5,250 USD per year based on their successful completion of classes. In 2021, 15 U.S. employees used this benefit to grow their professional development through formal education. MRC Global also hosts internships and apprentice programs in some countries. Both of these initiatives focus on allowing young employees the opportunity to learn on the job training and gain experience in technical product roles.
 
Culture. We are proud of the role we play in providing safe, productive and fulfilling jobs to our employees. Our core values underpin our culture. They are:

● | Safety Leadership | ● | Financial Performance 
--+------------------------+---+------------------------------
● | Customer Satisfaction | ● | Teamwork 
● | Business Ethics | ● | Employee Development 
● | Operational Excellence | ● | Community/Charity Involvement

 
All new hires are onboarded with training that covers our culture including mission, vision, and core values. Adherence to the core values is also evaluated for every employee as part of our employee development process. We maintain an independent process for confidential reporting of workplace concerns through our toll-free hotline, and the ability to bypass management and directly contact the Legal or Human Resource Departments or the Company's Audit Committee regarding concerns.
 
Diversity.  As we operate in many countries and have an increasingly global and diverse customer base, we strive to have our team members reflect this diversity of cultures, backgrounds and approaches in our business. We are committed to maintaining a harassment and discrimination-free workplace where every employee feels safe, valued and encouraged regardless of age, gender, race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, veteran status, disabilities or backgrounds. We want every one of our employees to have the opportunity to grow his or her career. While we do not maintain specific diversity quotas, our Human Resources Department actively monitors our hiring and promotion processes, so that diverse candidates are considered for open roles. In addition, as part of our succession planning process, we identify high potential employees that include diverse candidates that are considered for promotions and developmental assignments. In 2021, across our global workforce, 27% of our employees were female. Additionally, 24% of our directors and above were female and 55% of our workforce in corporate functions were women.
Monitoring for Success.  We monitor our workforce to determine its overall effectiveness by reviewing metrics related to headcount, composition, voluntary and involuntary turnover, diversity, performance per employee (such as revenue per employee or adjusted EBTIDA per employee) and selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales. In 2020, we implemented a new human capital management system that is global in nature to help us manage our employee initiatives and development.

Sustainability
 
Our Sustainable Business Model.  Our distribution capabilities can flex with the needs of customers and service new customers in new end markets. Although the primary customers for our PVF products are gas utility, energy and industrial companies, we also distribute PVF to other end users as well. For instance, in our downstream, industrial and energy transition sector, we distribute PVF to companies engaged in metals and mining, fabrication, power generation, chemical production, carbon capture, biofuels, offshore wind and other general industrial uses. Our distribution platform can also supply new product lines to existing customers and new end markets.
MRC Global’s Sustainability Initiatives.  The primary way that we can reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases in our operations is to create an efficient supply chain. An efficient supply chain reduces the carbon footprint of deliveries to our distribution centers and service centers and, ultimately to our customers. Use of our distribution centers and hub and spoke delivery model allow us to aggregate product across multiple suppliers and customers, which, in turn, prevents each customer from separately creating duplicative supply chains that require fuel for deliveries and resources to manage.
 
As a distributor, we are engaged in a relatively low amount of manufacturing and assembly, mostly through the actuation and valve modification services that we offer our customers. We do not utilize large amounts of water. Our energy inputs are primarily electricity for lighting, heating and office and warehouse equipment, natural gas for heating and gasoline for company sales and delivery vehicles. We are reviewing this usage and seeking efficiencies to reduce use of these resources and resulting emissions. We have recycling programs to minimize waste from used pallets, cardboard, office paper and other recyclables. 
 
Market Opportunities.  As a distributor of PVF, we sell products to existing and new customers that control the flow of liquids and gases in a sustainable manner. Most of the products we provide are used to prevent and minimize accidental leaks of hydrocarbons into the air and spills. In addition, integrated oil and other energy companies, many of which are our customers, have requirements to reduce their methane and other emissions and consider these targets when designing, constructing, upgrading, maintaining and operating their facilities. Recently, the EPA initiated a rulemaking process to require the reduction of methane in oil and gas production and hydrocarbon pipelines. We sell a number of products that reduce the emissions of gases, including methane. In particular, in 2021, 94% of our sales of valves were low-emission valves that control methane and other emissions. Many of the other valves that we sold were sold into applications such as the transfer of water that do not emit greenhouse gases or environmentally dangerous substances.

Environmental Matters 
 
We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, foreign and provincial environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements (collectively, “environmental laws”), including those governing the following:

● | the discharge of pollutants or hazardous substances into the air, soil or water; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the generation, handling, use, management, storage and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous substances and wastes;
● | the responsibility to investigate, remediate, monitor and clean up contamination; and 
● | occupational health and safety. 

 
Historically, the costs to comply with environmental laws have not been material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are not aware of any pending environmental compliance or remediation matters that, in the opinion of management, are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows. However, our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, employee, neighbor or other third-party claims for property damage and personal injury, requirements to clean up property or to pay for the costs of cleanup or regulatory or judicial orders requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions.
 
Certain environmental laws, such as the U.S. federal Superfund law or its state or foreign equivalents, may impose the obligation to investigate, remediate, monitor and clean up contamination at a facility on current and former owners, lessees or operators or on persons who may have sent waste to that facility for disposal. These environmental laws may impose liability without regard to fault or to the legality of the activities giving rise to the contamination. Although we are not aware of any active litigation against us under the U.S. federal Superfund law or its state or foreign equivalents, we have identified contamination at several of our current and former facilities, and we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to investigate, remediate, monitor and clean up these conditions. To date, these costs have no had a material impact on our business. Moreover, we may incur liabilities in connection with environmental conditions currently unknown to us relating to our prior, existing or future owned or leased sites or operations or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have assumed or acquired. We believe that indemnities contained in certain of our acquisition agreements may cover certain environmental conditions existing at the time of the acquisition subject to certain terms, limitations and conditions. However, if these indemnification provisions terminate or if the indemnifying parties do not fulfill their indemnification obligations, we may be subject to liability with respect to the environmental matters that those indemnification provisions address.
 
Certain governments at the international, national, regional and state level are at various stages of considering or implementing treaties and environmental laws that could limit emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, associated with the burning of fossil fuels. For instance, in September 2016, 175 countries ratified the Paris Agreement, which requires member countries to review and determine their respective goals towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While the U.S. initially chose to pull out of the Paris Agreement, the new administration has implemented executive orders for the U.S. to rejoin the agreement, which presumably will require the U.S. to set greenhouse gas reduction goals and enact policies to meet those goals. Certain states, regions and cities have also adopted or are considering environmental laws that impose overall caps or taxes on greenhouse gas emissions from certain sectors or facility categories or mandate the increased use of electricity from renewable energy sources. It is not possible to predict how new environmental laws to address greenhouse gas emissions, including new laws or programs implemented by the new administration, would impact our business or that of our customers, but these laws and regulations could impose costs on us or create a shift in the market for the products that we distribute and hence affect our business. The U.S. Energy Information Agency ("EIA") in its International Energy Outlook 2021 report continues to project, based on the agency's reference case, increases in world energy consumption for oil and gas through 2050, although this projection could change depending on regulatory developments, technological changes and changes in energy mix.
 
In addition, the EPA has previously implemented regulations that require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain categories of emission sources, including (among others) New Source Performance Standards for new power plants and emission guidelines for existing power plants (commonly known as the “Clean Power Plan”). In anticipation of and in response to these regulations, United States electric producers have been switching from coal to natural gas as a cleaner burning fuel source. This replacement of natural gas for coal has benefitted our business as our customers include natural gas producers. There have been various court challenges and regulatory changes to these EPA regulations, such as the EPA’s June 2019 repeal of the Clean Power Plan and finalization of a replacement rule (known as the Affordable Clean Energy Rule) and, in January 2021, a D.C. Circuit vacatur of the Affordable Clean Energy Rule. Even so, switching from coal to natural gas has continued, in part, driven by low natural gas prices as well as continued regulatory uncertainty regarding coal emissions. In November, 2021, the EPA proposed amendments to the existing greenhouse gas emissions regulations for the oil and natural gas production industry, but it is currently not possible to predict the final scope of any new rule and, therefore, how this new rule will impact our business or that of our customers.  We predominately sell valves and other products that assist customers in the prevention of emissions of greenhouse gases, such as methane, and believe that the passage of a final rule could be an opportunity to assist customers with their compliance with the rule.
 
Federal, state, local, foreign and provincial governments have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, environmental laws that could impose more stringent permitting; disclosure; wastewater and other waste disposal; greenhouse gas, ethane or volatile organic compound control, leak detection and repair requirements; and well construction and testing requirements on our customers’ hydraulic fracturing. 
 
Environmental laws applicable to our business and the business of our customers, including environmental laws regulating the energy industry, and the interpretation or enforcement of these environmental laws, are constantly evolving; it is impossible to predict accurately the effect that changes in these environmental laws, or their interpretation or enforcement, may have upon our business, financial condition or results of operations. Should environmental laws, or their interpretation or enforcement, become more stringent, our costs, or the costs of our customers, could increase, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
