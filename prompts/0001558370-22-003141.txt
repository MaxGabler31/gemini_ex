ITEM 1.BUSINESS
General
Kronos Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: KRO) (Kronos), incorporated in Delaware in 1989, is a leading global producer and marketer of value-added titanium dioxide pigments, or TiO2, a base industrial product used in a wide range of applications. We, along with our distributors and agents, sell and provide technical services for our products to approximately 4,000 customers in 100 countries with the majority of our sales in Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific region. We believe we have developed considerable expertise and efficiency in the manufacture, sale, shipment and service of our products in domestic and international markets.
TiO2 is a white inorganic pigment used in a wide range of products for its exceptional durability and its ability to impart whiteness, brightness and opacity. TiO2 is a critical component of everyday applications, such as coatings, plastics and paper, as well as many specialty products such as inks, food and cosmetics. TiO2 is widely considered to be superior to alternative white pigments in large part due to its hiding power (or opacity), which is the ability to cover or mask other materials effectively and efficiently. TiO2 is designed, marketed and sold based on specific end-use applications.
TiO2 is the largest commercially used whitening pigment because it has a high refractive rating, giving it more hiding power than any other commercially produced white pigment. In addition, TiO2 has excellent resistance to interaction with other chemicals, good thermal stability and resistance to ultraviolet degradation. Although there are other white pigments on the market, we believe there are no effective substitutes for TiO2 because no other white pigment has the physical properties for achieving comparable opacity and brightness or can be incorporated in as cost-effective a manner. Pigment extenders such as kaolin clays, calcium carbonate and polymeric opacifiers are used together with TiO2 in a number of end-use markets. However, these products are not able to duplicate the opacity performance characteristics of TiO2 and we believe these products are unlikely to have a significant impact on the use of TiO2.
TiO2 is considered a “quality-of-life” product. Demand for TiO2 has generally been driven by worldwide gross domestic product and has generally increased with rising standards of living in various regions of the world. According to industry estimates, TiO2 consumption has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3% since 2000. Per capita consumption of TiO2 in Western Europe and North America far exceeds that in other areas of the world, and these regions are expected to continue to be the largest consumers of TiO2 on a per capita basis for the foreseeable future. We believe that Western Europe and North America currently each account for approximately 16% of global TiO2 consumption. Markets for TiO2 are generally increasing in China, the Asia Pacific region, South America and Eastern Europe and we believe these are significant markets which will continue to grow as economies in these regions continue to develop and quality-of-life products, including TiO2, experience greater demand.
At December 31, 2021, approximately 50% of our common stock was owned by Valhi, Inc. (NYSE: VHI) and approximately 30% was owned by a wholly-owned subsidiary of NL Industries, Inc. (NYSE: NL). Valhi also owns approximately 83% of NL Industries’ outstanding common stock. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Contran Corporation held approximately 92% of Valhi’s outstanding common stock. As discussed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Lisa K. Simmons and a trust established for the benefit of Ms. Simmons and her late sister and their children (the “Family Trust”) may be deemed to control Contran, and therefore may be deemed to indirectly control the wholly-owned subsidiary of Contran, Valhi, NL and us.
Products and end-use markets
Including our predecessors, we have produced and marketed TiO2 in North America and Europe, our primary markets, for over 100 years. We believe we are the largest producer of TiO2 in Europe with 46% of our 2021 sales volumes attributable to markets in Europe. The table below shows our estimated market share for our significant markets, Europe and North America, for the last three years.

We believe we are the leading seller of TiO2 in several countries, including Germany, with an estimated 8% share of worldwide TiO2 sales volume in 2021. Overall, we are one of the top five producers of TiO2 in the world.
We offer our customers a broad portfolio of products that include over 40 different TiO2 pigment grades under the KRONOS® trademark, which provide a variety of performance properties to meet customers’ specific requirements. Our major customers include domestic and international paint, plastics, decorative laminate and paper manufacturers. We ship TiO2 to our customers in either a dry or slurry form via rail, truck and/or ocean carrier. Sales of our core TiO2 pigments represented approximately 92% of our net sales in 2021. We and our agents and distributors primarily sell our products in three major end-use markets: coatings, plastics and paper.
The following tables show our approximate TiO2 sales volume by geographic region and end-use for the year ended December 31, 2021:

 | ​ | | | ​ | | ​ | | 
---------------------------------------------+---+------------------------------------+---+---+----------+---+----+--
Sales volume percentagesby geographic region | ​ | Sales volume percentagesby end-use

​
Some of the principal applications for our products include the following:
TiO2 for coatings – Our TiO2 is used to provide opacity, durability, tinting strength and brightness in industrial coatings, as well as coatings for commercial and residential interiors and exteriors, automobiles, aircraft, machines, appliances, traffic paint and other special purpose coatings. The amount of TiO2 used in coatings varies widely depending on the opacity, color and quality desired. In general, the higher the opacity requirement of the coating, the greater the TiO2 content.
TiO2 for plastics – We produce TiO2 pigments that improve the optical and physical properties of plastics, including whiteness and opacity. TiO2 is used to provide opacity to items such as containers and packaging materials, and vinyl products such as windows, door profiles and siding. TiO2 also generally provides hiding power, neutral undertone, brightness and surface durability for housewares, appliances, toys, computer cases and food packages. TiO2’s high brightness along with its opacity, is used in some engineering plastics to help mask their undesirable natural color. TiO2 is also used in masterbatch, which is a concentrate of TiO2 and other additives and is one of the largest uses for TiO2 in the plastics end-use market. In masterbatch, the TiO2 is dispersed at high concentrations into a plastic resin and is then used by manufacturers of plastic containers, bottles, packaging and agricultural films.
TiO2 for paper – Our TiO2 is used in the production of several types of paper, including laminate (decorative) paper, filled paper and coated paper to provide whiteness, brightness, opacity and color stability. Although we sell our TiO2 to all segments of the paper end-use market, our primary focus is on the TiO2 grades used in paper laminates, where several layers of paper are laminated together using melamine resin under high temperature and pressure. The top layer of paper contains TiO2 and plastic resin and is the layer that is printed with decorative patterns. Paper laminates are used to replace materials such as wood and tile for such applications as counter tops, furniture and wallboard. TiO2 is beneficial in these applications because it assists in preventing the material from fading or changing color after prolonged exposure to sunlight and other weathering agents.
TiO2 for other applications – We produce TiO2 to improve the opacity and hiding power of printing inks. TiO2 allows inks to achieve very high print quality while not interfering with the technical requirements of printing machinery, including low abrasion, high printing speed and high temperatures. Our TiO2 is also used in textile applications where TiO2 functions as an opacifying and delustering agent. In man-made fibers such as rayon and polyester, TiO2 corrects an otherwise undesirable glossy and translucent appearance. Without the presence of TiO2, these materials would be unsuitable for use in many textile applications.

We produce high-purity sulfate process anatase TiO2 used to provide opacity, whiteness and brightness in a variety of cosmetic and personal care products, such as skin cream, lipstick, eye shadow and toothpaste. Our TiO2 is also found in food products, such as candy and confectionaries, and in pet foods where it is used to obtain uniformity of color and appearance. In pharmaceuticals, our TiO2 is used commonly as a colorant in tablet and capsule coatings as well as in liquid medicines to provide uniformity of color and appearance. KRONOS® purified anatase grades meet the applicable requirements of the CTFA (Cosmetics, Toiletries and Fragrances Association), USP and BP (United States Pharmacopoeia and British Pharmacopoeia) and the FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration).
Our TiO2 business is enhanced by the following three complementary businesses, which comprised approximately 8% of our net sales in 2021:

● | We own and operate two ilmenite mines in Norway pursuant to a governmental concession with an unlimited term. Ilmenite is a raw material used directly as a feedstock by some sulfate-process TiO2 plants. We supply ilmenite to our sulfate plants in Europe. We also sell ilmenite ore to third parties, some of whom are our competitors, and we sell an ilmenite-based specialty product to the oil and gas industry. The mines have estimated ilmenite reserves that are expected to last at least 50 years.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We manufacture and sell iron-based chemicals, which are co-products and processed co-products of sulfate and chloride process TiO2 pigment production. These co-product chemicals are marketed through our Ecochem division and are primarily used as treatment and conditioning agents for industrial effluents and municipal wastewater as well as in the manufacture of iron pigments, cement and agricultural products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We manufacture and sell other specialty chemicals, which are side-stream specialty products from the production of TiO2. Such specialty chemicals are used in applications in the formulation of pearlescent pigments, production of electroceramic capacitors for cell phones and other electronic devices and natural gas pipe and other specialty applications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing, operations and properties
We produce TiO2 in two crystalline forms: rutile and anatase. Rutile TiO2 is manufactured using both a chloride production process and a sulfate production process, whereas anatase TiO2 is only produced using a sulfate production process. Manufacturers of many end-use applications can use either form, especially during periods of tight supply for TiO2. The chloride process is the preferred form for use in coatings and plastics, the two largest end-use markets. Due to environmental factors and customer considerations, the proportion of TiO2 industry sales represented by chloride process pigments has remained stable relative to sulfate process pigments, and in 2021, chloride process production facilities represented approximately 45% of industry capacity. The sulfate process is preferred for use in selected paper products, ceramics, rubber tires, man-made fibers, food products, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Once an intermediate TiO2 pigment has been produced by either the chloride or sulfate process, it is “finished” into products with specific performance characteristics for particular end-use applications through proprietary processes involving various chemical surface treatments and intensive micronizing (milling).

● | Chloride process – The chloride process is a continuous process in which chlorine is used to extract rutile TiO2. The chloride process produces less waste than the sulfate process because much of the chlorine is recycled and feedstock bearing higher titanium content is used. The chloride process also has lower energy requirements and is less labor-intensive than the sulfate process, although the chloride process requires a higher-skilled labor force. The chloride process produces an intermediate base pigment with a wide range of properties.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sulfate process – The sulfate process is a batch process in which sulfuric acid is used to extract the TiO2 from ilmenite or titanium slag. After separation from the impurities in the ore (mainly iron), the TiO2 is precipitated and calcined to form an intermediate base pigment ready for sale or can be upgraded through finishing treatments.

We produced 546,000, 517,000 and 545,000 metric tons of TiO2 in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Our production volumes include our share of the output produced by our TiO2 manufacturing joint venture discussed below. Our average production capacity utilization rates were approximately 98% in 2019, 92% in 2020 and at full practical capacity in 2021. Our production rates in 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as we decreased production levels early in the third quarter to correspond with a temporary decline in market demand.
We operate facilities throughout North America and Europe, including the only sulfate process plant in North America and four TiO2 plants in Europe (one in each of Leverkusen, Germany; Nordenham, Germany; Langerbrugge, Belgium; and Fredrikstad, Norway). In North America, we have a TiO2 plant in Varennes, Quebec, Canada and, through the manufacturing joint venture described below, a 50% interest in a TiO2 plant near Lake Charles, Louisiana.
As part of our long-term strategy to increase chloride process production, we phased-out sulfate production at our Leverkusen facility during 2020. Our chloride process production and remaining sulfate production capacity has increased by approximately 5% over the past ten years due to debottlenecking programs, incurring only moderate capital expenditures. We expect to operate our TiO2 plants at near full practical capacity levels in 2022.
The following table presents the division of our expected 2022 manufacturing capacity by plant location and type of manufacturing process:

(1) | The Leverkusen facility is located within an extensive manufacturing complex owned by Bayer AG. We own the Leverkusen facility, which represents about one-third of our current TiO2 production capacity, but we lease the land under the facility from Bayer under a long-term agreement which expires in 2050. Lease payments are periodically negotiated with Bayer for periods of at least two years at a time. A majority-owned subsidiary of Bayer provides some raw materials including chlorine, auxiliary and operating materials, utilities and services necessary to operate the Leverkusen facility under separate supplies and services agreements.

(3) | We operate the facility near Lake Charles through a joint venture with Venator Investments LLC (Venator Investments), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Venator Group, of which Venator Materials PLC (Venator) owns 100% and the amount indicated in the table above represents the share of TiO2 produced by the joint venture to which we are entitled. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and “TiO2 manufacturing joint venture.” The joint venture owns the land and facility.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We own the land underlying all of our principal production facilities unless otherwise indicated in the table above.
We also operate two ilmenite mines in Norway pursuant to a governmental concession with an unlimited term. In addition, we operate a rutile slurry manufacturing plant near Lake Charles, Louisiana, which converts dry pigment primarily manufactured for us at the Lake Charles TiO2 facility into a slurry form that is then shipped to customers.

We have corporate and administrative offices located in the U.S., Germany, Norway, Canada, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom and various sales offices located in North America.
TiO2 manufacturing joint venture
Kronos Louisiana, Inc., one of our subsidiaries, and Venator Investments each own a 50% interest in a manufacturing joint venture, Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P. (LPC). LPC owns and operates a chloride-process TiO2 plant located near Lake Charles, Louisiana. We and Venator share production from the plant equally pursuant to separate offtake agreements, unless we and Venator otherwise agree.
A supervisory committee directs the business and affairs of the joint venture, including production and output decisions. This committee is composed of four members, two of whom we appoint and two of whom Venator appoints. Two general managers manage the operations of the joint venture acting under the direction of the supervisory committee. We appoint one general manager and Venator appoints the other.
We do not consolidate LPC because we do not control it. We account for our interest in the joint venture by the equity method. The joint venture operates on a break-even basis and therefore we do not have any equity in earnings of the joint venture. We are required to purchase one half of the TiO2 produced by the joint venture. All costs and capital expenditures are shared equally with Venator with the exception of feedstock (purchased natural rutile ore or chlorine slag) and packaging costs for the pigment grades produced. Our share of net costs is reported as cost of sales as the TiO2 is sold. See Notes 5 and 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Raw materials
The primary raw materials used in chloride process TiO2 are titanium-containing feedstock (purchased natural rutile ore or chlorine slag), chlorine and petroleum coke. Chlorine is available from a number of suppliers, while petroleum coke is available from a limited number of suppliers. Titanium-containing feedstock suitable for use in the chloride process is available from a limited but increasing number of suppliers principally in Australia, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Canada and India. We purchase feedstock for our chloride process TiO2 from the following primary suppliers for certain contractually specified volumes for delivery extending, in some cases, through 2023:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
---------------------------------+---+-----------------------------+---+-------------------------------
Supplier | ​ | Product | ​ | Renewal Terms 
Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Ltd. | ​ | Chloride process grade slag | ​ | Auto-renews bi-annually 
Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Ltd. | ​ | Upgraded slag | ​ | Auto-renews annually 
Tizir Titanium & Iron AS | ​ | Chloride process grade slag | ​ | Renewal terms upon negotiation
Sierra Rutile Limited | ​ | Rutile ore | ​ | Renewal terms upon negotiation
Base Titanium Limited | ​ | Rutile ore | ​ | Renewal terms upon negotiation

In the past we have been, and we expect that we will continue to be, successful in obtaining short-term and long-term extensions to these and other existing supply contracts prior to their expiration. We expect the raw materials purchased under these contracts, and contracts that we may enter into, will meet our chloride process feedstock requirements over the next several years. Contracts may be terminated with a 12-month written notice (generally for multi-year agreement terms) or based on certain defaults by either party or failure to agree on pricing as noted in the agreements.
The primary raw materials used in sulfate process TiO2 are titanium-containing feedstock, primarily ilmenite or purchased sulfate grade slag, and sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is available from a number of suppliers. Titanium-containing feedstock suitable for use in the sulfate process is available from a limited number of suppliers principally in Norway, Canada, Australia, India and South Africa. As one of the few vertically integrated producers of sulfate process TiO2, we operate two rock ilmenite mines in Norway, which provided all of the feedstock for our European sulfate process TiO2 plants in 2021. We expect ilmenite production from our mines to meet our European sulfate process feedstock requirements for the foreseeable future. For our Canadian sulfate process plant, we purchase sulfate grade slag primarily from Rio Tinto Fer et Titane Inc. under a supply contract that renews annually, subject to termination upon twelve months written notice. We expect the raw materials purchased under this contract, and contracts that we may enter into, to meet our sulfate process feedstock requirements over the next several years.

Sales and marketing
Our marketing strategy is aimed at developing and maintaining strong relationships with new and existing customers. Because TiO2 represents a significant input cost for our customers, the purchasing decisions are often made by our customers’ senior management. We work to maintain close relationships with the key decision makers through in-depth and frequent contact. We endeavor to extend these commercial and technical relationships to multiple levels within our customers’ organizations using our direct sales force and technical service group to accomplish this objective. We believe this helps build customer loyalty to Kronos and strengthens our competitive position. Close cooperation and strong customer relationships enable us to stay closely attuned to trends in our customers’ businesses. Where appropriate, we work in conjunction with our customers to solve formulation or application problems by modifying specific product properties or developing new pigment grades. We also focus our sales and marketing efforts on those geographic and end-use market segments where we believe we can realize higher selling prices. This focus includes continuously reviewing and optimizing our customer and product portfolios.
We also work directly with our customers to monitor the success of our products in their end-use applications, evaluate the need for improvements in our product and process technology and identify opportunities to develop new product solutions for our customers. Our marketing staff closely coordinates with our sales force and technical specialists to ensure the needs of our customers are met, and to help develop and commercialize new grades where appropriate.
We sell a majority of our products through our direct sales force operating in Europe and North America. We also utilize sales agents and distributors who are authorized to sell our products in specific geographic areas. In Europe, our sales efforts are conducted primarily through our direct sales force and our sales agents. Our agents do not sell any TiO2 products other than KRONOS® branded products. In North America, our sales are made primarily through our direct sales force and supported by a network of distributors. In export markets, where we have increased our marketing efforts over the last several years, our sales are made through our direct sales force, sales agents and distributors. In addition to our direct sales force and sales agents, many of our sales agents also act as distributors to service our customers in all regions. We offer customer and technical service to customers who purchase our products through distributors as well as to our larger customers serviced by our direct sales force.
We sell to a diverse customer base and no single customer comprised 10% or more of our net sales in 2021. Our largest ten customers accounted for approximately 32% of net sales in 2021.
Neither our business as a whole nor any of our principal product groups is seasonal to any significant extent. However, TiO2 sales are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, due in part to the increase in coatings production in the spring to meet demand during the spring and summer painting seasons. With certain exceptions such as during the third quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have historically operated our production facilities at near full capacity rates throughout the entire year, which among other things helps to minimize our per-unit production costs. As a result, we normally will build inventories during the first and fourth quarters of each year in order 

9



to maximize our product availability during the higher demand periods normally experienced in the second and third quarters.
Competition
The TiO2 industry is highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of price, product quality, technical service and the availability of high-performance pigment grades. Since TiO2 is not traded through a commodity market, its pricing is largely a product of negotiation between suppliers and their respective customers. Price and availability are the most significant competitive factors along with quality and customer service for the majority of our product grades. Increasingly, we are focused on providing pigments that are differentiated to meet specific customer requests and specialty grades that are differentiated from our competitors’ products. During 2021, we had an estimated 8% share of worldwide TiO2 sales volume, and based on sales volume, we believe we are the leading seller of TiO2 in several countries, including Germany.
Our principal competitors are The Chemours Company, Tronox Incorporated, Lomon Billions and Venator Materials PLC. The top five TiO2 producers (i.e. we and our four principal competitors) account for approximately 52% of the world’s production capacity.
The following chart shows our estimate of worldwide production capacity in 2021:
​

​ | ​ | ​ 
-------------------------------------+---+----
Worldwide production capacity - 2021
Chemours | | 15%
Tronox | ​ | 13%
Lomon Billions | | 11%
Venator | | 7% 
Kronos | | 6% 
Other | | 48%

​
Chemours has approximately one-half of total North American TiO2 production capacity and is our principal North American competitor. In 2019, Tronox acquired certain of the TiO2 assets of Cristal Global. Lomon Billions announced it added approximately 260,000 tons of chloride capacity in 2019 and plans to add an additional 200,000 tons by 2023.
The TiO2 industry is characterized by high barriers to entry consisting of high capital costs, proprietary technology and significant lead times required to construct new facilities or to expand existing capacity. Over the past ten years, we and our competitors increased industry capacity through debottlenecking projects, which in part compensated for the shut-down of various TiO2 plants throughout the world. Although overall industry demand is expected to increase in 2022, other than through debottlenecking projects and the Lomon Billions expansion mentioned above, we do not expect any significant efforts will be undertaken by us or our principal competitors to further increase capacity and we believe it is unlikely any new TiO2 plants will be constructed in Europe or North America for the foreseeable future. If actual developments differ from our expectations, the TiO2 industry’s and our performance could be unfavorably affected.
Research and development
We employ scientists, chemists, process engineers and technicians who are engaged in research and development, process technology and quality assurance activities in Leverkusen, Germany. These individuals have the responsibility for improving our chloride and sulfate production processes, improving product quality and strengthening our competitive position by developing new products and applications. Our expenditures for these activities were approximately $17 million in 2019, $16 million in 2020 and $17 million in 2021. We expect to spend approximately $18 million on research and development in 2022.
We continually seek to improve the quality of our grades and have been successful in developing new grades for existing and new applications to meet the needs of our customers and increase product life cycles. Since the beginning of 2017, we have added nine new grades for pigments and other applications.

Patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights
We have a comprehensive intellectual property protection strategy that includes obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents, primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe. We also protect our trademark and trade secret rights and have entered into license agreements with third parties concerning various intellectual property matters. We have also from time to time been involved in disputes over intellectual property.
Patents – We have obtained patents and have numerous patent applications pending that cover our products and the technology used in the manufacture of our products. Our patent strategy is important to us and our continuing business activities. In addition to maintaining our patent portfolio, we seek patent protection for our technical developments, principally in the United States, Canada and Europe. U.S. patents are generally in effect for 20 years from the date of filing. Our U.S. patent portfolio includes patents having remaining terms ranging from two years to 20 years.
Trademarks and trade secrets – Our trademarks, including KRONOS®, are covered by issued and/or pending registrations, including in Canada and the United States. We protect the trademarks that we use in connection with the products we manufacture and sell and have developed goodwill in connection with our long-term use of our trademarks. We conduct research activities in secret and we protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets through reasonable measures, including confidentiality agreements and security procedures, including data security. We rely upon unpatented proprietary knowledge and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our proprietary chloride production process is an important part of our technology and our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain confidentiality of our trade secrets used in this technology.
Regulatory and environmental matters
Our operations and properties are governed by various environmental laws and regulations which are complex, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. These environmental laws govern, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air, or water; and the health and safety of our employees. Certain of our operations are, or have been, engaged in the generation, storage, handling, manufacture or use of substances or compounds that may be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable environmental laws and regulations. As with other companies engaged in similar businesses, certain of our past and current operations and products have the potential to cause environmental or other damage. We have implemented and continue to implement various policies and programs in an effort to minimize these risks. Our policy is to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations at all our facilities and to strive to improve our environmental performance and overall sustainability. It is possible that future developments, such as stricter requirements in environmental laws and enforcement policies, could adversely affect our operations, including production, handling, use, storage, transportation, sale or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or require us to make capital and other expenditures to comply, and could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations or liquidity. During 2021, we were notified by government authorities in Norway that the classification of a dam at our mine facilities was changed to the highest level for Norwegian classification of dam structures. As a result, our mine operations are subject to a higher degree of oversight and regulation than existed prior to this change in classification, and we expect to incur additional capital expenditures to adapt to the higher classification standards. 
We have a history of identifying new ways to reduce consumption and waste by converting byproducts to co-products through our ecochem® products. Annually we update and publish our Safety, Environment, Energy and Quality Policy which is translated into local languages and distributed to all our employees and shared publicly via our website. We have implemented rigorous procedures for incident reporting and investigation, including root cause analysis of environmental and safety incidents and near misses. Because TiO2 production requires significant energy input, we are focused on energy efficiency at all production locations. Three of our five production facilities maintain certifications to the ISO 50001:2018 Energy Management standard and all locations have local energy teams in place. These teams are responsible for maintaining ISO 50001:2018 certifications (where applicable), performing regular reviews of local energy consumption, making recommendations regarding capital projects that reduce energy consumption or enhance efficiency, and partnering with local government authorities through grant opportunities to reduce energy consumption and associated Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions. We also actively manage potential water-related risks, including flooding and water shortages. Our manufacturing facilities are strategically located adjacent to sources of water, which we use for process 

11



operations and for shipping and receiving raw materials and finished products. Water-critical processes are identified and ongoing efforts to minimize water use are incorporated into environmental planning.
Our U.S. manufacturing operations are governed by federal, state, and local environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations. These include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, or CERCLA, as well as the state counterparts of these statutes. Some of these laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination, even if these owners or operators did not know of, and were not responsible for, such contamination. These laws also assess liability on any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person. Although we have not incurred and do not currently anticipate any material liabilities in connection with such environmental laws, we may be required to make expenditures for environmental remediation in the future. 
While the laws regulating operations of industrial facilities in Europe vary from country to country, a common regulatory framework is provided by the European Union, or the EU. Germany and Belgium are members of the EU and follow its initiatives. Norway is not a member but generally patterns its environmental regulatory actions after those of the EU. 
​
From time to time, our facilities may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under U.S. and non-U.S. statutes. Typically, we establish compliance programs to resolve these matters. Occasionally, we may pay penalties. To date, such penalties have not involved amounts having a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. We believe all of our facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. 
​
From time to time, new environmental, health and safety regulations are passed or proposed in the countries in which we operate or sell our products, seeking to regulate our operations or to restrict, limit or classify TiO2. We believe we are in substantial compliance with laws applicable to the regulation of TiO2. However, increased regulatory scrutiny could affect consumer perception of TiO2 or limit the marketability and demand for TiO2 or products containing TiO2 and increase Kronos’ regulatory and compliance costs.
On February 18, 2020, the EU published the regulation classifying dry TiO2 and mixtures containing dry TiO2 as a suspected carcinogen via inhalation under its EU Regulation No. 1272/2008 on classification and labeling substances and mixtures. The regulation went into force on October 1, 2021 when hazard labels were required on certain dry TiO2 products and certain mixtures containing dry TiO2 in the EU. Our dry TiO2 products do not meet the criteria set forth in the regulation and therefore do not require classification labels. 
This classification of TiO2 is based on scientifically questioned animal test data. Separate studies of TiO2 workers conducted by the TiO2 industry have shown no TiO2 specific links to cancer. We intend to comply with the new requirements including working with customers and other stakeholders on compliance matters as appropriate. 
Our capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance, protection and improvement programs, including capital expenditures which are primarily focused on increasing operating efficiency but also result in improved environmental protection such as lower emissions from our manufacturing facilities, were $14.2 million in 2021 and are currently expected to be approximately $32 million in 2022. 
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
We seek to operate our businesses in line with sound ESG principles that include corporate governance, social responsibility, sustainability, and cybersecurity. We believe ESG means conducting operations with high standards of environmental and social responsibility, practicing exemplary ethical standards, focusing on safety as a top priority, respecting and supporting our local communities, and continuously developing our employees. At our facilities, we undertake various environmental sustainability programs, and we promote social responsibility and volunteerism through 

12



programs designed to support and give back to the local communities in which we operate. Each of our locations maintains site-specific safety programs and disaster response and business continuity plans. All manufacturing facilities have detailed, site-specific emergency response procedures that we believe adequately address regulatory compliance, vulnerability to potential hazards, emergency response and action plans, employee training, alarms and warning systems and crisis communication.
At a corporate level, we engage in periodic reviews of our cybersecurity programs, including cybersecurity risk and threats. Our cybersecurity programs are built on operations and compliance foundations. Operations focus on continuous detection, prevention, measurement, analysis, and response to cybersecurity alerts and incidents and on emerging threats. Compliance establishes oversight of our cybersecurity programs by creating risk-based controls to protect the integrity, confidentiality, accessibility, and availability of company data stored, processed, or transferred. We periodically update our board of directors on our cyber-related risks and cybersecurity programs. 
In an effort to align our non-employee directors’ financial interests with those of our stockholders, our Board established share ownership guidelines for our non-management directors. 
We have taken steps to integrate ESG considerations into operating decisions with other critical business factors. We biennially publish an ESG Report, which is available on our public website. The primary purpose of our ESG Report is to describe our policies and programs in the area of ESG, including certain internal metrics and benchmarks related to various aspects of ESG. We voluntarily developed these internal metrics and benchmarks, which we use to identify progress and opportunities for improvement. These metrics are not intended to be directly comparable to similar metrics utilized by other companies to track ESG performance. 
Human capital resources
Employees – Our operating results depend in part on our ability to successfully manage our human capital resources, including attracting, identifying, and retaining key talent. We have a well-trained labor force with a substantial number of long-tenured employees. We provide competitive compensation and benefits to our employees, some of which are offered under collective bargaining agreements. In addition to salaries, these programs, which vary by country/region, can include annual bonuses, a defined benefit pension plan, a defined contribution plan with employer matching opportunities, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, employee assistance programs, and tuition assistance. 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed the following number of people:
​

​ | ​ | ​ 
------------------+---+------
Europe | | 1,840
Canada | ​ | 353 
United States (1) | ​ | 55 
Total | | 2,248

(1)Excludes employees of our LPC joint venture.

Certain employees at each of our production facilities are organized by labor unions. We strive to maintain good relationships with all our employees, including the unions and workers’ councils representing those employees. In Europe, our union employees are covered by master collective bargaining agreements for the chemical industry that are generally renewed annually. At December 31, 2021, approximately 88% of our worldwide workforce is organized under collective bargaining agreements. We did not experience any work stoppages during 2021, although it is possible that there could be future work stoppages or other labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. 
Health and safety – Protecting the health and safety of our workforce, our customers, our business partners, and the natural environment is one of our core values. We are committed to maintaining a strong safety culture where all workers meet or exceed required industry performance standards and continuously seek to improve occupational and process safety performance. We are conducting our businesses in ways that provide all personnel with a safe and healthy 

13



work environment and have established safety and environmental programs and goals to achieve such results. We expect our manufacturing facilities to produce our products safely and in compliance with local regulations, policies, standards and practices intended to protect the environment and people and have established global policies designed to promote such compliance. We require our employees to comply with such requirements. We provide our workers with the tools and training necessary to make the appropriate decisions to prevent accidents and injuries. Each of our operating facilities develops, maintains, and implements safety programs encompassing key aspects of their operations. In addition, management reviews and evaluates safety performance throughout the year. We monitor conditions that could lead to a safety incident and keep track of injuries through reporting systems in accordance with laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. With this data we calculate incident frequency rates to assess the quality of our safety performance. At the global level we also track overall safety performance. Each of our operating locations is subject to local laws and regulations that dictate what injuries are required to be recorded and reported, which may differ from location to location and result in different methods of injury rate calculation. For internal global tracking, benchmarking and identification of opportunities for improvement, we collect the location specific information and apply a U.S.-based injury rate calculation to arrive at a global total frequency rate, which is expressed as the number of incidents at our operating locations per 200,000 hours. This internal safety metric may not be directly comparable to a recordable incident rate calculated under US law. Our global total frequency rate was 1.59 in 2019, 1.61 in 2020 and 1.08 in 2021.
Diversity and inclusion – We recognize that everyone deserves respect and equal treatment. As a global company, we embrace diversity and collaboration in our workforce and our business initiatives. We are an equal opportunity employer and we base employment decisions on merit, competence and qualifications, without regard to race, color, national origin, gender, age, religion, disability, sex, sexual orientation or other characteristics protected by applicable law in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We promote a respectful, diverse, and inclusive workplace in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity.
