Corporate History and Overview
 
We were first incorporated in Nevada as Surf A Movie Solutions, Inc. on December 18, 2007 to engage in the business of the development sale and marketing of online video sales. We were not successful in our efforts and discontinued this line of business. Since that time and until August 8, 2014, we were a “shell company” (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act).

On August 30, 2013, we changed our name to Frac Water Systems, Inc. and on October 10, 2013 we decided to engage in the business of providing economically and environmentally sound solutions for the treatment and recycling of wastewater resulting principally from oil and gas exploration and production activities. Due to our research of the business opportunities, on December 31, 2013 we determined not to move forward with this line of business.
 
In early March 2014, we decided to enter in to the business of developing, manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical level products containing phytocannabinnoids, an abundant and pharmaceutically active component of industrial hemp, for the prevention and alleviation of various conditions and diseases. In connection therewith, on March 17, 2014, we changed our name to Cannabis Therapy Corporation and on March 24, 2014 changed our trading symbol on OTC Markets to “CTCO”. On December 23, 2014, we changed our name to Peak Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and our trading symbol changed to “PKPH” on February 5, 2015.
 
Since early March 2014 we had been operating as a bio-pharmaceutical and nutraceutical company seeking to develop, manufacture, market and sell safe, high quality, medicinal products based on extracts from hemp. Our primary initial focus was on exploitation of the exclusive license we received from Canna-Pet, LLC, a developer of ingestible health products for pets made from hemp. We had also taken initial steps related to development of over-the-counter, THC-free, hemp based products for the human market for the prevention and alleviation of symptoms associated with inflammatory and auto-immune diseases. Recently, hemp cultivation was legalized in 11 states, including Colorado, and, on a limited basis, at the federal level as part of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (the “2014 US Farm Bill”) passed in February 2014, which sets the agricultural product apart from marijuana. Industrial hemp has THC content below 0.3%, compared to the 1-20% typically found in marijuana.
 
On July 29, 2014, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Peak BioPharma Corp., we entered into a License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Canna-Pet, LLC, (“Licensor”) a Washington limited liability corporation. They own the brand name “Canna-Pet” and certain related intellectual property including, but not limited to, trademarks and copyrights, formulations, recipes, production processes and systems, websites, domain names, customer lists, supplier lists, trade secrets and know-how, and other related intellectual property (collectively, the “Licensed Intellectual Property”). This is used by the Licensor in the conduct of its business related to the production and sale of medical products made from industrial hemp, which are intended exclusively for consumption by pets. Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Licensor granted to us a perpetual, exclusive, world-wide license to use the Licensed Intellectual Property in conjunction with our business and the production and sale of medical products made from industrial hemp, as well as the right to sublicense the Licensed Intellectual Property to third parties. The License Agreement gave us the right to produce and sell existing products utilizing the Licensed Intellectual Property and to develop new products, jointly with Licensor or otherwise, based upon the Licensed Intellectual Property. The License Agreement provided us with an immediate revenue source and access to Licensor’s customer base. The License Agreement specified that during the term of the license, all intellectual property rights in and to the Licensed Intellectual Property remain the exclusive property of Licensor.
 
In consideration of the grant of the license, we agreed to pay Licensor license fees in the form of royalty payments calculated based on gross proceeds received by us from sales of products manufactured, marketed or sold by us utilizing the Licensed Intellectual Property or any subsequently developed intellectual property which is jointly owned by us and Licensor. We began selling Canna-Pet products in October 2014.
 
Based upon recent regulatory activity related to imposition of restrictions and limitations on the sale of hemp-based health products for pets, we elected to terminate our license agreement with the Licensor, effective as of October 1, 2015, and to cease all operations relating to sale of hemp-based products for pets.
 
On October 12, 2015, we entered into an agreement for the termination (“Termination Agreement”) of the License Agreement, effectively selling the discontinued operations. The Termination Agreement contained the following provisions:

• | Termination of License: The parties agreed to terminate the License Agreement effective as of October 1, 2015, this termination was made by mutual agreement of the parties pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of the License Agreement. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Return of Licensed Intellectual Property: We agreed to return all Licensed Intellectual Property to the Licensor, and our right to use all, or any portion, of the Licensed Intellectual Property ceased effective as of October 1, 2015, Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, the Licensed Intellectual Property included the brand name “Canna-Pet” and certain related intellectual property, including, but not limited, trademarks and copyrights, formulations, recipes, production processes and systems, websites, domain names, customer lists, supplier lists trade secrets and know- how, and other related intellectual property. 
• | Return of Other Property: In addition to return of the Licensed Intellectual Property, we agreed to transfer to Licensor all product inventory, Colorado hemp with permits and authorization, all production/fulfillment contracts, all e-commerce accounts and processing, all non-disclosure and research agreements and any and all other property in our possession which was used by us in the conduct of our business related to production and sale of medical cannabis products for pets made from hemp and low-THC cannabis plants. 
• | Office Space, Equipment and Employees: In conjunction with the execution of the Termination Agreement, we granted the Licensor the right to use our office space, for the three-month period from October 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, on a rent-free basis. 
• | Consideration: As consideration for the cancellation of the License Agreement and the return of other property, as described above, the Licensor agreed to waive payment by us and to release us from liability for payment of any and all unpaid royalties, invoices and other amounts which were otherwise currently due and payable by us to Licensor for sales of Canna-Pet products for all periods through and including September 30, 2015. 
• | Collections: On October 15, 2015, we forwarded to the Licensor all payments received by us after September 30, 2015 (net of amounts received by us for taxes, duties, governmental charges, freight or shipping charges, and the like) for Canna- Pet products sold on or after October 1, 2015. 

 
The following is a summary of the net assets sold as initially determined at Septembers 30, 2015 and updated October 15, 2015:

Furthermore, based on advice from the Food and Drug Administration, as well as our regulatory counsel, we decided to revise our strategy and discontinue all efforts to develop and market hemp based health products. We currently are pursuing to acquire or merge with an entity with significant operations in order to create a viable business model and value for our shareholders.
 
All of our business operations are carried out through our wholly owned subsidiary, Peak BioPharma Corp., a Colorado corporation. Throughout this Report, unless otherwise noted or required by the context, references to “the Company,” “us,” “we,” “our,” and similar terms refer to Peak Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiary, Peak BioPharma Corp.
 
We currently have authorized 350,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of (i) 325,000,000 shares of common stock, and (ii) 25,000,000 shares of “blank check” Preferred Stock.
