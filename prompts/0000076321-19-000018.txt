Item 1. Business
General
Unless otherwise indicated, the terms “Company,” “Parker,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Parker Drilling Company together with its subsidiaries and “Parker Drilling” refers solely to the parent, Parker Drilling Company. Parker Drilling was incorporated in the state of Oklahoma in 1954 after having been established in 1934. In March 1976, the state of incorporation of the Company was changed to Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 5 Greenway Plaza, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77046.
We are an international provider of contract drilling and drilling-related services as well as rental tools and services. We have operated in over 50 countries since beginning operations in 1934, making us among the most geographically experienced drilling contractors and rental tools providers in the world. We currently have operations in 20 countries. Parker has participated in numerous world records for deep and extended-reach drilling land rigs and is an industry leader in quality, health, safety and environmental practices.
Our business is comprised of two business lines: (1) Drilling Services and (2) Rental Tools Services. We report our Drilling Services business as two reportable segments: (1) U.S. (Lower 48) Drilling and (2) International & Alaska Drilling. We report our Rental Tools Services business as two reportable segments: (1) U.S. Rental Tools and (2) International Rental Tools. For information regarding our reportable segments and operations by geographic areas for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, see Note 16 - Reportable Segments in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Recent Developments
Reorganization and Chapter 11 Proceedings
On December 12, 2018 (the “Petition Date”), Parker Drilling and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed a prearranged plan of reorganization (the “Plan”) and commenced voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”). Since the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors have continued to operate their businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.
Also on December 12, 2018, prior to the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors entered into a restructuring support agreement (as amended, the “RSA”) with certain significant holders (together, collectively, the “Consenting Stakeholders”) of (i) 7.50% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “7.50% Note Holders”) issued pursuant to the indenture dated July 30, 2013 (the “7.50% Notes”), by and among Parker Drilling, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”), (ii) 6.75% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “6.75% Note Holders”) issued pursuant to the indenture dated January 22, 2014 (the “6.75% Notes” and together with the 7.50% Notes, the “Senior Notes”), by and among Parker Drilling, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto and the Trustee, (iii) Parker Drilling’s existing common stock (the “Common Holders”) and (iv) Parker Drilling’s 7.25% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Convertible Preferred Stock,” and such holders, the “Preferred Holders”) to support a restructuring (the “Restructuring”) on the terms set forth in the Plan.
On December 13, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving joint administration of the Chapter 11 Cases under the caption In re Parker Drilling Company, et al.
Pursuant to the terms of the RSA and the Plan, the Consenting Stakeholders and other holders of claims against or interests in the Debtors receive treatment under the Plan summarized as follows:

• | holders of claims arising from non-funded debt general unsecured obligations receive payment in full in cash as set forth in the Plan;


• | the 7.50% Note Holders receive their pro rata share of: (a) approximately 34.3 percent of the common stock (the “New Common Stock”) of Parker Drilling, as reorganized pursuant to and under the Plan (“Reorganized Parker”), subject to dilution; (b) approximately $92.6 million of a new second lien term loan of Reorganized Parker (the “New Second Lien Term Loan”); (c) the right to purchase approximately 24.3 percent of the New Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the terms of the Rights Offering (as defined in the RSA); and (d) cash sufficient to satisfy certain expenses owed to the Trustee (the “Trustee Expenses”), to the extent not otherwise paid by the Debtors;


• | the 6.75% Note Holders receive their pro rata share of: (a) approximately 62.9 percent of the New Common Stock, subject to dilution; (b) approximately $117.4 million of the New Second Lien Term Loan; (c) the right to purchase approximately 38.9 percent of the New Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the terms of the Rights Offering; and (d) cash sufficient to satisfy the Trustee Expenses, to the extent not otherwise paid by the Debtors;


• | the Preferred Holders receive their pro rata share of: (a) 1.1 percent of the New Common Stock, subject to dilution; (b) the right to purchase approximately 14.7 percent of the New Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the terms of the Rights Offering; and (c) 40.0 percent of the warrants to acquire an aggregate of 13.5 percent of the New Common Stock (the “New Warrants”); and


• | the Common Holders receive their Pro Rata share of: (a) 1.65 percent of the New Common Stock, subject to dilution; (b) the right to purchase approximately 22.1 percent of the New Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the terms of the Rights Offering; and (c) 60.0 percent of the New Warrants.

The RSA contains certain covenants on the part of each of the Debtors and the Consenting Stakeholders, including certain limitations on the parties’ ability to pursue alternative transactions, commitments by the Consenting Stakeholders to vote in favor of the Plan and commitments of the Debtors and the Consenting Stakeholders to negotiate in good faith to finalize the documents and agreements governing the Plan. The RSA also provides for certain conditions to the obligations of the parties and for termination upon the occurrence of certain events, including, without limitation, the failure to achieve certain milestones and certain breaches by the parties under the RSA.
Since the Petition Date, the Debtors have requested and received certain approvals and authorizations from the Bankruptcy Court. This relief, together with the proposed treatment under the Plan, provides that vendors and other unsecured creditors will be paid in full and in the ordinary course of business. All existing customer and vendor contracts are expected to remain in place and be serviced in the ordinary course of business.
On March 5, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court held a hearing to determine whether the Plan should be confirmed. On March 7, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan. Although the Bankruptcy Court has confirmed the Plan, the Debtors have not yet consummated all of the transactions that are contemplated by the Plan. Rather, the Debtors intend to consummate these transactions in the near future, on or before the Plan’s effective date (the “Effective Date”). As set forth in the Plan, there are certain conditions precedent to the occurrence of the Effective Date, which must be satisfied or waived in accordance with the Plan in order for the Plan to become effective and the Debtors to emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases. The Debtors anticipate that each of these conditions will be either satisfied or waived by the end of March 2019, which is the target for the Debtors’ emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases. On the Effective Date, the Debtors’ operations will, generally, no longer be governed by the Bankruptcy Court’s oversight.
The Company’s filing of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default of certain of its debt instruments described above, which accelerated the Company’s obligations under its Senior Notes. Under the Bankruptcy Code, holders of the Senior Notes are stayed from taking any action against the Company as a result of this event of default. All of the Company’s outstanding obligations under its Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of January 26, 2015, among Parker Drilling, Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Barclays Bank PLC and the other lenders and L/C issuers from time to time party thereto (as amended, the “2015 Secured Credit Agreement”) were paid prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and the 2015 Secured Credit Agreement was terminated substantially concurrent with the filing.  
Debtor-in-Possession Financing
In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, Bank of America, N.A. (“Bank of America”) and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch (“DB”) agreed to provide the Debtors with a superpriority and priming asset-based debtor-in-possession credit facility (the “DIP Facility”) on the terms set forth in the Debtor-In-Possession Financing Term Sheet attached to the RSA (the “DIP Term Sheet”). On December 14, 2018, the Debtors, Bank of America and DB entered into a Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement, which provides for, among other things, the DIP Facility. The DIP Facility is comprised of an asset-based revolving loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base thereunder, $20.0 million of which is available for the issuance of standby letters of credit.
In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, (i) Bank of America and DB agreed to provide, on a committed basis, the Company with an exit financing asset-based revolving loan facility on the terms set forth in the Senior Secured Asset-Based Revolving Facility Summary of Terms and Conditions attached to the RSA (the “First Lien Exit Term Sheet”) and (ii) certain Consenting Stakeholders and/or their affiliates have agreed to provide, on a committed basis, the Company with a new second lien term loan facility on the terms set forth in the New Second Lien Loan Term Sheet attached to the RSA (the “Second Lien Exit Term Sheet”). The First Lien Exit Term Sheet provides for, among other things, an asset-based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million, which amount may be increased to an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million
in the event additional commitments are received from other lenders (the “First Lien Exit Facility”). A portion of the First Lien Exit Facility in the amount of $30.0 million (the “L/C Facility”) will be available for the issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit. The Second Lien Exit Term Sheet provides for, among other things, a second lien term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $210.0 million (the “Second Lien Exit Facility”).
The foregoing descriptions of the First Lien Exit Term Sheet and the Second Lien Exit Term Sheet do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the First Lien Exit Term Sheet or the Second Lien Exit Term Sheet, as applicable. The effectiveness of the First Lien Exit Facility and the Second Lien Exit Facility is subject to customary closing conditions. The foregoing descriptions of the First Lien Exit Facility and the Second Lien Exit Facility do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the final, executed documents memorializing the First Lien Exit Facility and the Second Lien Exit Facility, as applicable, in each case as approved by the Bankruptcy Court.
Going Concern and Financial Reporting in Reorganization
Our commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases and the weak industry conditions have negatively impacted our results of operations and cash flows and may continue to do so in the future. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles which contemplate the continuation of the Company as a going concern. See Note 2 - Chapter 11 Cases in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information regarding our debt instruments and bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 11. 
Delisting of our Common Stock from the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”)
Our common stock was previously listed on the NYSE under the symbol “PKD.” As a result of our failure to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NYSE, on December 12, 2018, our common stock was delisted from the NYSE. Since December 13, 2018, our common stock has been quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace maintained by the OTC Markets Group, Inc. (“OTC Pink”) under the symbol “PKDSQ”.
 Drilling Services Business
In our Drilling Services business, we drill oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells for customers globally. We provide this service with both Company-owned rigs and customer-owned rigs. We refer to the provision of drilling services with customer-owned rigs as our operations and management (“O&M”) service in which operators own their own drilling rigs, but choose Parker Drilling to operate and manage the rigs for them. The nature and scope of activities involved in drilling an oil or natural gas well is similar whether it is drilled with a Company-owned rig (as part of a traditional drilling contract) or a customer-owned rig (as part of an O&M contract). In addition, we provide project-related services, such as engineering, procurement, project management, commissioning of customer-owned drilling rig projects, operations execution, and quality and safety management. We have extensive experience and expertise in drilling geologically challenging wells and in managing the logistical and technological challenges of operating in remote, harsh, and ecologically sensitive areas.
U.S. (Lower 48) Drilling
Our U.S. (Lower 48) Drilling segment provides drilling services with our Gulf of Mexico (“GOM”) barge drilling rig fleet and markets our U.S. (Lower 48)-based O&M services. We also provide O&M services for a customer-owned rig offshore California. Our GOM barge rigs drill for oil and natural gas in shallow waters in and along the inland waterways and coasts of Louisiana, Alabama and Texas. The majority of these wells are drilled in shallow water depths ranging from 6 to 12 feet. Our rigs are suitable for a variety of drilling programs, from inland coastal waters requiring shallow draft barges, to open water drilling on both state and federal water projects requiring more robust capabilities. Contract terms typically consist of well-to-well or multi-well programs, most commonly ranging from 20 to 180 days.
International & Alaska Drilling
Our International & Alaska Drilling segment provides drilling services, using both Company-owned rigs and O&M contracts, and project-related services. The drilling markets in which this segment operates have one or more of the following characteristics:

• | customers typically are major, independent, or national oil and natural gas companies or integrated service providers;


• | drilling programs in remote locations with little infrastructure, requiring a large inventory of spare parts and other ancillary equipment and self-supported service capabilities;


• | complex wells and/or harsh environments (such as high pressures, deep depths, hazardous or geologically challenging conditions and sensitive environments) requiring specialized equipment and considerable experience to drill; and


• | O&M contracts that generally cover periods of one year or more.

We have rigs under contract in Alaska, Kazakhstan, the Kurdistan region of Iraq, Guatemala, Mexico, and on Sakhalin Island, Russia. In addition, we have O&M and ongoing project-related services for customer-owned rigs in California, Kuwait, Canada, Indonesia, and on Sakhalin Island, Russia.
Rental Tools Services Business
In our Rental Tools Services business, we provide premium rental equipment and services to exploration & production companies, drilling contractors, and service companies on land and offshore in the U.S. and select international markets. Tools we provide include standard and heavy-weight drill pipe, all of which are available with standard or high-torque connections, tubing, drill collars, pressure control equipment, including blowout preventers, and more. We also provide well construction services, which include tubular running services and downhole tool rentals, well intervention services, which include whipstocks, fishing and related services, as well as inspection and machine shop support. Rental tools are used during drilling and/or workover programs and are requested by the customer as needed, requiring us to keep a broad inventory of rental tools in stock. Rental tools are usually rented on a daily or monthly basis.
U.S. Rental Tools
Our U.S. Rental Tools segment maintains an inventory of rental tools for deepwater, drilling, completion, workover, and production applications at facilities in Louisiana, Texas, Wyoming, North Dakota and West Virginia. We also provide well construction and well intervention services. Our largest single market for rental tools is U.S. land drilling, a cyclical market driven primarily by oil and natural gas prices and our customers’ access to project financing. A portion of our U.S. rental tools business supplies tubular goods and other equipment to offshore GOM customers.
International Rental Tools
Our International Rental Tools segment maintains an inventory of rental tools and provides well construction, well intervention, and surface and tubular services to our customers in the Middle East, Latin America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions.
Our Business Strategy
We intend to successfully compete in select energy services businesses that benefit our customers’ exploration, appraisal, and development programs, and in which operational execution is the key measure of success. We plan to do this by:

• | Consistently delivering innovative, reliable, and efficient results that help our customers reduce their operational risks and manage their operating costs; and


• | Over the longer-term, investing to improve and grow our existing business lines and to expand the scope of products and services we offer, both organically and through acquisitions.

Customers and Scope of Operations
Our customer base consists of major, independent, and national oil and natural gas E&P companies and integrated service providers. Each of our segments depends on a limited number of key customers and the loss of any one or more key customers could have a material adverse effect on a segment. In 2018, our largest customer, Exxon Neftegas Limited (“ENL”), accounted for approximately 25.7 percent of our total consolidated revenues. For information regarding our reportable segments and operations by geographic areas for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, see Note 16 - Reportable Segments in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Competition 
We operate in competitive businesses characterized by high capital requirements, rigorous technological challenges, evolving regulatory requirements, and challenges in securing and retaining qualified field personnel.
In drilling markets, most contracts are awarded on a competitive bidding basis and operators often consider reliability, efficiency, and safety in addition to price. We have been successful in differentiating ourselves from competitors through our 
drilling performance and safety record, and through providing services that help our customers manage their operating costs and mitigate their operational risks.
In international drilling markets, we compete with a number of international drilling contractors as well as local contractors. Although local drilling contractors often have lower labor and mobilization costs, we are generally able to distinguish ourselves from these companies based on our technical expertise, safety performance, quality of service, and experience. We believe our expertise in operating in challenging environments has been a significant factor in securing contracts. 
In the GOM barge drilling market, we compete with a small number of contractors. We have the largest number and greatest diversity of rigs available in this market, allowing us to provide equipment and services that are well-matched to customers’ requirements. We believe the market for drilling contracts will continue to be competitive with continued focus on reliability, efficiency, and safety, in addition to price.
In rental tools markets, we compete with both large and small suppliers. We compete against other rental tools companies based on breadth of inventory, availability of product, quality of product and service, as well as, price. In the U.S. market, our network of locations provides broad and efficient product availability for our customers. In international markets, some of our rental tools business is obtained in conjunction with our drilling and O&M projects.
Contracts
Most drilling contracts are awarded based on competitive bidding. The rates specified in drilling contracts vary depending upon the type of rig employed, equipment and services supplied, crew complement, geographic location, term of the contract, competitive conditions, and other variables. Our contracts generally provide for an operating dayrate during drilling operations, with lower rates for periods of equipment downtime, customer stoppage, well-to-well rig moves, adverse weather, or other conditions, and no payment when certain conditions continue beyond contractually established parameters. Contracts typically provide for a different dayrate or specified fixed payments during mobilization or demobilization. The terms of most of our contracts are based on either a specified period of time or a specified number of wells. The contract term in some instances may be extended by the customer exercising options for an additional time period or for the drilling of additional wells, or by exercising a right of first refusal. Most of our contracts allow termination by the customer prior to the end of the term without penalty under certain circumstances, such as the loss of or major damage to the drilling unit or other events that cause the suspension of drilling operations beyond a specified period of time. See “Certain of our contracts are subject to cancellation by our customers without penalty and with little or no notice” in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Certain contracts require the customer to pay an early termination fee if the customer terminates a contract before the end of the term without cause. Our project services contracts include engineering, procurement, and project management consulting, for which we are compensated through labor rates and cost-plus arrangements for non-labor items.
Rental tools contracts are typically on a dayrate basis with rates based on type of equipment and competitive conditions. Depending on market and competitive conditions, rental rates may be applied from the time the equipment leaves our facility or only when the equipment is actually in use by the customer. Rental contracts generally require the customer to pay for lost-in-hole or damaged equipment. Some of the services provided in the rental tools segment are billed per well section with pricing determined by the length and diameter of the well section. In addition, some tools, such as whipstocks, are sold to the customer.
Seasonality
Our rigs in the inland waters of the GOM are subject to severe weather during certain periods of the year, particularly during hurricane season from June through November, which could halt operations for prolonged periods or limit contract opportunities during that period. In addition, mobilization, demobilization, or well-to-well movements of rigs in arctic regions can be affected by seasonal changes in weather or weather so severe that conditions are deemed too unsafe to operate.
Backlog
Backlog is our estimate of the dollar amount of drilling contract revenues we expect to realize in the future as a result of executing awarded contracts. The Company’s backlog of firm orders was approximately $243.4 million as of December 31, 2018 and $240.9 million as of December 31, 2017 and is primarily attributable to the International & Alaska segment of our Drilling Services business. We estimate that, as of December 31, 2018, 54.0 percent of our backlog will be recognized as revenues within one year. 
The amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned could be different from amounts disclosed in our backlog calculations due to a lack of predictability of various factors, including the scope of equipment and service provided, unscheduled repairs, maintenance requirements, weather delays, contract terminations or renegotiations, new contracts, and other factors. See “Our backlog of contracted revenues may not be fully realized and may reduce significantly 
in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows” in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
 Insurance and Indemnification
Substantially all of our operations are subject to hazards that are customary for oil and natural gas drilling operations, including blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, lost or stuck drill strings, equipment defects, cratering, oil and natural gas well fires and explosions, natural disasters, pollution, mechanical failure, and damage or loss during transportation. Some of our fleet is also subject to hazards inherent in marine operations, either while on-site or during mobilization, such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision, damage from severe weather, and marine life infestations. These hazards could result in damage to or destruction of drilling equipment, personal injury and property damage, suspension of operations, or environmental damage, which could lead to claims by third parties or customers, suspension of operations, and contract terminations. We have had accidents in the past due to some of these hazards.
Our contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification between ourselves and our customers. We maintain insurance with respect to personal injuries, damage to or loss of equipment, and various other business risks, including well control and subsurface risk. Our insurance policies typically have 12-month policy periods.
Our insurance program provides coverage, to the extent not otherwise paid by the customer under the indemnification provisions of the drilling or rental tool contract, for liability due to well control events and liability arising from third-party claims, including wrongful death and other personal injury claims by our personnel as well as claims brought on behalf of individuals who are not our employees. Generally, our insurance program provides liability coverage up to $350.0 million, with retentions of $1.0 million or less.
Well control events generally include an unintended flow from the well that cannot be contained by using equipment on site (e.g., a blowout preventer), by increasing the weight of drilling fluid or by diverting the fluids safely into production. Our insurance program provides coverage for third-party liability claims relating to sudden and accidental pollution from a well control event up to $350.0 million per occurrence. A separate limit of $50.0 million exists to cover the costs of re-drilling of the well and well control costs under a Contingent Operators Extra Expense policy. For our rig-based operations, remediation plans are in place to prevent the spread of pollutants and our insurance program provides coverage for removal, response, and remedial actions. We retain the risk for liability not indemnified by the customer below the retention and in excess of our insurance coverage.
Based upon a risk assessment and due to the high cost, high self-insured retention, and limited availability of coverage for windstorms in the GOM, we have elected not to purchase windstorm insurance for our barge rigs in the GOM. Although we have retained the risk for physical loss or damage for these rigs arising from a named windstorm, we have procured insurance coverage for removal of a wreck caused by a windstorm.
Our contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification from our customers and may require us to indemnify our customers in certain circumstances. Liability with respect to personnel and property is customarily assigned on a “knock-for-knock” basis, which means we and our customers customarily assume liability for our respective personnel and property regardless of fault. In addition, our customers typically indemnify us for damage to our equipment down-hole, and in some cases, our subsea equipment, generally based on replacement cost minus some level of depreciation. However, in certain contracts we may assume liability for damage to our customer’s property and other third-party property on the rig and in other contracts we are not indemnified by our customers for damage to their property and, accordingly, could be liable for any such damage under applicable law. 
Our customers typically assume responsibility for and indemnify us from any loss or liability resulting from pollution, including clean-up and removal and third-party damages, arising from operations under the contract and originating below the surface of the land or water, including losses or liability resulting from blowouts or cratering of the well. In some contracts, however, we may have liability for damages resulting from such pollution or contamination caused by our gross negligence or, in some cases, ordinary negligence.
We generally indemnify the customer for legal and financial consequences of spills of industrial waste, lubricants, solvents and other contaminants (other than drilling fluid) on the surface of the land or water originating from our rigs or equipment. We typically require our customers to retain liability for spills of drilling fluid which circulates down-hole to the drill bit, lubricates the bit and washes debris back to the surface. Drilling fluid often contains a mixture of synthetics, the exact composition of which is prescribed by the customer based on the particular geology of the well being drilled.
The above description of our insurance program and the indemnification provisions typically found in our contracts is only a summary as of the date hereof and is general in nature. Our insurance program and the terms of our drilling and rental tool contracts may change in the future. In addition, the indemnification provisions of our contracts may be subject to differing interpretations, and enforcement of those provisions may be limited by public policy and other considerations.
If any of the aforementioned operating hazards results in substantial liability and our insurance and contractual indemnification provisions are unavailable or insufficient, our financial condition, operating results, or cash flows may be materially adversely affected.

Environmental Considerations
Our operations are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations, as well as the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions in which we operate, pertaining to the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and state equivalents, issue regulations to implement and enforce laws pertaining to the environment, which often require costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties or may result in injunctive relief for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences; restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities; limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive, and other protected areas; require remedial action to clean up pollution from former operations; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly compliance could adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as those of similarly situated entities operating in the same markets. While our management believes that we comply with current applicable environmental laws and regulations, there is no assurance that compliance can be maintained in the future.
As an owner or operator of both onshore and offshore facilities, including mobile offshore drilling rigs in or near waters of the United States, we may be liable for the costs of clean up and damages arising out of a pollution incident to the extent set forth in federal statutes such as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”)), as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”); the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”); the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”); the Clean Air Act (“CAA”); the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”); the Occupational Safety and Health Act; the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (“EPCRA”); and the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (“HMTA”) as well as comparable state laws. In addition, we may also be subject to civil claims arising out of any such incident.
The CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. In September 2015, a new EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) rule defining the scope of federal jurisdiction over wetlands and other waters became effective (the “Clean Water Rule”). The Clean Water Rule was previously stayed nationwide to determine whether federal district or appellate courts had jurisdiction to hear cases challenging the rule. The EPA and the Corps issued a proposed rulemaking in June 2017 to repeal the Clean Water Rule, and announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction. In January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision finding that jurisdiction resides with the federal district courts to hear challenges to the Clean Water Rule; following which, the previously-filed district court cases have been allowed to proceed. Following the Supreme Court’s decision, the EPA and the Corps issued a final rule in January 2018 staying implementation of the 2015 rule for two years while the agencies reconsider the rule. Multiple states and environmental groups have challenged the stay, and on August 16, 2018, a federal court in South Carolina issued an injunction against EPA’s stay of the rule. On December 11, 2018, EPA proposed a new rule defining the scope of federal jurisdiction over wetlands and other waters, a public hearing on which was originally scheduled for January 23, 2019. This hearing was indefinitely postponed during the shutdown of the federal government and has not yet been rescheduled. To the extent the rule expands the range of properties subject to the CWA’s jurisdiction, certain energy companies could face increased costs and 
delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas, which in turn could reduce demand for our services. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. The CWA and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges.        
The OPA and related regulations impose a variety of regulations on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of spills of oil or other hazardous substances and liability for damages resulting from such spills. “Responsible parties” include the owner or operator of a vessel, pipeline or onshore facility, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. The OPA assigns strict and joint and several liability for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages to each responsible party. The OPA also requires some facilities to demonstrate proof of financial responsibility and to prepare an oil spill response plan. Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation in a spill may subject a responsible party to civil or criminal enforcement actions.
The OCSLA authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the Outer Continental Shelf. Specific design and operational standards may apply to Outer Continental Shelf vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and structures. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) regulates the design and operation of well control and other equipment at offshore production sites, implementation of safety and environmental management systems, and mandatory third-party compliance audits, among other requirements. Violations of environmentally related lease conditions or regulations issued pursuant to the OCSLA can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and the cancellation of leases. Such enforcement liabilities, delay, or restriction of activities can result from either governmental or citizen prosecution.
High-profile and catastrophic events, such as the 2010 Macondo (Deepwater Horizon) well incident, have heightened governmental and environmental focus on the oil and gas industry. From time to time, legislative proposals have been introduced that would materially limit or prohibit offshore drilling in certain areas. Our operations, and those of our customers, are impacted by restrictions on drilling in certain areas of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere, including the adoption of additional safety requirements and policies regarding the approval of drilling permits and restrictions on development and production activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
On July 28, 2016, BSEE adopted a new well-control rule that will be implemented in phases over the next several years (the "2016 Well Control Rule"). This rule includes more stringent design requirements for well-control equipment used in offshore drilling operations. BSEE was directed to review the 2016 Well Control Rule pursuant to Executive Order (“EO”) 13783 (“Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth”) and Section 7 of EO 13795 (“Implementing an America-First Offshore Energy Strategy”), to determine if the rule should be revised to encourage energy exploration and production on the Outer Continental Shelf, while still providing for safe and environmentally responsible exploration and production activities. On May 11, 2018, BSEE announced a proposed rule intending to reduce the regulatory burden of the 2016 Well Control Rule, the comment period for which ended on August 6, 2018. We are continuing to evaluate the cost and effect that these new rules will have on our operations.
CERCLA (also known as “Superfund”) and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the activity, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. While CERCLA exempts crude oil from the definition of hazardous substances for purposes of the statute, our operations may involve the use or handling of other materials that may be classified as hazardous substances. CERCLA assigns strict liability to a broad class of potentially responsible parties for all response and remediation costs, as well as natural resource damages. In addition, persons responsible for release of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liability for the cost of cleaning up the hazardous substances released into the environment and for damages to natural resources.
RCRA and comparable state laws regulate the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Current RCRA regulations specifically exclude from the definition of hazardous waste “drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy.” However, these wastes and other wastes may be otherwise regulated by EPA or state agencies. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, spent solvents, laboratory wastes, and used oils, may be regulated as hazardous waste. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration- and production-related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. 
If the EPA proposes rulemaking for revised oil and gas regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Although the costs of managing solid and hazardous wastes may be significant and new regulations may be imposed, we do not expect to experience more burdensome costs than competitor companies involved in similar drilling operations.
The CAA and similar state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants and may also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. In addition, those laws may require us to obtain permits for the construction, modification, or operation of certain projects or facilities and the utilization of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. For example, the EPA has adopted regulations known as “RICE MACT” that require the use of “maximum achievable control technology” to reduce formaldehyde and other emissions from certain stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines, which can include portable engines used to power drilling rigs. In addition, in May 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements. The EPA has also adopted new rules under the CAA that require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from certain fractured and refractured natural gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions, also known as “green completions.” These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. Further, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion in October 2015. Pursuant to an order issued by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in lawsuits brought by a coalition of states and environmental groups against the EPA for failing to complete initial area designations under the standard by the October 2017 statutory deadline, EPA completed all remaining initial area designations on July 17, 2018. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements or delay, or limit our ability or our customers’ ability to obtain permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment and decreased demand for our services.
Some scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases including carbon dioxide and methane, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” (“GHGs”), may be contributing to the warming of the atmosphere resulting in climate change. There are a variety of legislative and regulatory developments, proposals, requirements, and initiatives that have been introduced in the U.S. and international regions in which we operate that are intended to address concerns that emissions of GHGs are contributing to climate change and these may increase costs of compliance for our drilling services or our customer’s operations. Among these developments, the Kyoto Protocol to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCC”) established a set of emission targets for GHGs that became binding on all those countries that had ratified it. The Kyoto Protocol was followed by the Paris Agreement of the 2015 UNFCC. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016 and, as of late 2017, had been ratified by 174 of the 197 parties to the UNFCC. However, on August 4, 2017, the United States formally communicated to the United Nations its intent to withdraw from participation in the Paris Agreement, which entails a four-year process and will be complete by November 2020. In response to the announced withdrawal plan, a number of state and local governments in the United States have expressed intentions to take GHG-related actions.
Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas or otherwise result in reduced economic activity generally. In addition, such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, which may have a negative impact on our business. In addition to potential impacts on our business directly or indirectly resulting from climate-change legislation or regulations, our business also could be negatively affected by climate-change related physical changes or changes in weather patterns. An increase in severe weather patterns could result in damages to or loss of our rigs, impact our ability to conduct our operations, and result in a disruption of our customers’ operations.
Hydraulic fracturing is a process sometimes used in the completion of oil and natural gas wells whereby water, other liquids, sand, and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate natural gas and, oil production. Various governmental entities (within and outside the United States) are in the process of studying, restricting, regulating, or preparing to regulate hydraulic fracturing, directly and indirectly. Many state governments require the disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process and, due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing, including on groundwater quality and seismic activity, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some state and local jurisdictions have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether. We do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities. However, these and other developments could cause operational delays or increased costs in exploration and production, which could adversely affect the demand for our products or services.
The federal ESA was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We may conduct operations on natural gas and oil leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered may exist. On February 11, 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) published a final policy which alters how it may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions and may materially delay or prohibit land access for natural gas and oil development. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our customer’s exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on their ability to develop and produce reserves. If our customers were to have a portion of their leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services.
Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations related to workplace safety and worker health, primarily the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations promulgated thereunder. In addition, various other governmental and quasi-governmental agencies require us to obtain certain miscellaneous permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. The kind of permits, licenses and certificates required by our operations depend upon a number of factors. We believe we have the necessary permits, licenses and certificates that are material to the conduct of our existing business.
