ITEM 1: BUSINESS
Corporate Profile
Cognex Corporation was incorporated in Massachusetts in 1981. Our corporate headquarters are located at One Vision Drive, Natick, Massachusetts 01760 and our telephone number is (508) 650-3000.
Cognex is a leading worldwide provider of machine vision products that capture and analyze visual information in order to automate manufacturing and distribution tasks where vision is required. Machine vision is the technology that gives computers and automation equipment the ability to see. Machine vision products are used to automate the manufacturing and tracking of discrete items, such as mobile phones, aspirin bottles, and automobile tires, by locating, identifying, inspecting, and measuring them during the manufacturing or distribution process. Machine vision is important for applications in which human vision is inadequate to meet requirements for size, accuracy, or speed, or in instances where substantial cost savings are obtained through the reduction of labor or improved product quality. 
Cognex operates in one segment, machine vision technology. We offer a variety of machine vision products that have similar economic characteristics, have the same production processes, and are distributed by the same sales channels to the same types of customers. Although Cognex sells to customers in a variety of industries, our largest industries are logistics, automotive, and consumer electronics, which combined represented approximately 70% of our total revenue in 2021. A large customer in the logistics industry represented approximately 17% of our total revenue in 2021.
Machine Vision Market
Cognex machine vision is used to automate manufacturing and distribution processes in a variety of industries, where the technology is widely recognized as an important component of automated production and quality assurance. Virtually every manufacturer or distributor can achieve better quality and efficiency by using machine vision, and therefore, Cognex products are used by a broad base of customers across a variety of industries, including logistics, automotive, consumer electronics, medical-related, semiconductor, consumer products, and food and beverage.
Although we consider Cognex to be one of the leading machine vision companies in the world, reliable estimates of the machine vision market and the number and relative size of competitors are not readily available. Our competitors include other vendors of machine vision systems, controllers, and components; manufacturers of image processing systems, sensors, and components; and system integrators. We also compete with internal engineering departments of current or prospective customers, as well as open-source tools available for free from various companies.
Cognex’s ability to compete depends on our ability to design, manufacture, and sell high-quality products, as well as our ability to develop new products and functionality that meet evolving customer requirements. The primary competitive factors affecting the choice of a machine vision system include product functionality and performance, ease of use, vendor reputation, price, and post-sales support. The importance of each of these factors varies depending on the specific customer’s needs.

Business Strategy
Our goal is to expand our position as a leading worldwide provider of machine vision products for industrial customers. We are selective in choosing growth opportunities that we believe will maintain our historically high gross margin percentages, which have been in the mid 70 percent range for the past several years and reflect the value our customers place on our innovative products. Our high gross margins have the potential to provide us with strong operating leverage in our financial model, as any incremental revenue at such margins falls through to operating income at a high ratio. Our strong and unique corporate culture reinforces our values of customer first and innovation, and enables us to attract and retain smart, energetic, and creative talent who are motivated to solve the most challenging vision tasks.
We invest heavily in research and development in order to maintain our position as a technology leader in machine vision. We invest in technology that makes vision easier to use and more affordable, and therefore, available to a broader base of customers, such as our vision sensor products that enable customers with a lower budget to use machine vision without the help of sophisticated engineers. We also invest in technology that addresses the most challenging vision applications, such as our 3D vision products that solve applications where a height or volume measurement is required and our deep learning vision software that solves complex applications with unpredictable defects and deviations. We invest through internal development, as well as the acquisition of businesses and technologies.
We continue to invest in our core markets, such as automotive and consumer electronics, where we are a leading provider of vision and ID products for factory automation, while making significant investments in the logistics market, where we are moving beyond barcode reading into more complex applications in e-commerce and omni-channel retail distribution centers, as well as parcel and post warehouses.
We reach a broad base of customers through our worldwide direct sales force that sells to large, strategic customers, as well as through our network of distributors and integrators that sell primarily to smaller customers who may be more geographically remote or may require supplemental technical support or integration assistance. We invest in emerging, high-growth regions where many manufacturers can benefit from incorporating machine vision into their production processes.
Acquisitions
Our business strategy includes selective expansion into new machine vision applications and markets through the acquisition of businesses and technologies. We consider business acquisitions to be an important part of our growth strategy, and although we continue to actively seek out acquisition opportunities, we are selective in choosing businesses that we believe will enhance long-term growth and profitability, as well as fit within our corporate culture. We plan to continue to seek opportunities to expand our product lines, customer base, distribution network, and technical talent through acquisitions in the machine vision industry.
Products
Cognex offers a full range of machine vision systems and sensors, vision software, and industrial image-based barcode readers designed to meet customer needs at different performance and price points. Our products range from low-cost vision sensors that conduct simple presence/absence inspections, to deep learning solutions that solve complex applications with unpredictable defects and deviations. Our products also have a variety of physical forms, depending on the user's needs. For example, customers can purchase vision software to use with their own camera and processor, or they can purchase a standalone unit that combines camera, processor, and software into a single package.
Vision Systems and Sensors
Vision systems combine smart cameras and software to perform a wide range of inspection tasks including part location, identification, measurement, assembly verification, and robotic guidance. Vision sensors deliver an easy-to-use, low-cost, reliable solution for simple pass/fail inspections, such as checking the presence and size of parts. In-Sight® vision systems and sensors, which includes 2D, 3D, and deep learning models, meet various price and performance requirements for factory automation customers. Our deep learning-based systems automate and solve complex inline inspections that typically require human judgment for defect detection, optical character recognition (OCR), assembly verification, or classification.

Research, Development, and Engineering
Cognex engages in research, development, and engineering (RD&E) to enhance our existing products and to develop new products and functionality to address market opportunities. In addition to internal research and development efforts, we intend to continue our strategy of gaining access to new technology through strategic relationships and acquisitions where appropriate.
RD&E expenses as a percentage of revenue were 13% in 2021, 16% in 2020, and 16% in 2019. We believe that a continued commitment to RD&E activities is essential in order to maintain or achieve product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, as well as to provide engineering support for large customers. In addition, we consider our ability to accelerate time to market for new products to be critical to our revenue growth. Therefore, we expect to continue to make significant RD&E investments in the future, and intend to continue our product development plans during periods of lower revenue levels. At any point in time, we have numerous research and development projects underway.
We rely on the technical expertise, creativity, and knowledge of our personnel, and therefore, we utilize patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection to maintain our competitive position and protect our proprietary rights in our products and technology. While our intellectual property rights are important to our success, we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual property right.
