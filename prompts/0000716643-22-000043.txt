Item 1.    Business
General:
Regis Corporation franchises and owns hairstyling and hair care salons. The Company is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "RGS." Unless the context otherwise provides, when we refer to the "Company," "we," "our," or "us," we are referring to Regis Corporation, the Registrant, together with its subsidiaries.
As of June 30, 2022, the Company franchised, owned or held ownership interests in 5,576 locations worldwide. The Company's locations consist of 5,395 franchised salons, 105 company-owned salons, and 76 locations in which we maintain a non-controlling ownership interest. Each of the Company's salon concepts generally offer similar salon products and services.
The major services supplied by the salons are haircutting and styling (including shampooing and conditioning), hair coloring and other services. Salons also sell a variety of hair care and other beauty products. We earn royalty revenue based on service and product sales at our franchise locations and earn revenue for services and products sold at our company-owned salons. Salons operate primarily under the trade names of Supercuts, SmartStyle, Cost Cutters, First Choice Haircutters and Roosters and they generally serve the value category within the industry. Salons are primarily located in strip center locations and Walmart Supercenters. 
Financial information about our segments and geographic areas for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 are included in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.
We have substantially completed our multi-year transformation to an asset-light fully-franchised business. As of June 30, 2022, 98.1% of our salons are owned by franchisees. The remaining 105 company-owned salons will be sold or closed when the leases expire.
Industry Overview:
The hair salon market is highly fragmented, with the vast majority of locations independently-owned and operated. However, the influence of salon chains, both franchised and corporate-owned, continues to grow within this market. Management believes salon chains will continue to have significant influence on this market and will continue to increase their presence due to name recognition and benefits that come with scale.
In nearly every area in which the Company has a salon, there are competitors offering similar hair care services and products at similar prices. The Company faces competition from chains, such as Great Clips, Fantastic Sams, Sport Clips and Ulta Beauty, independently-owned salons, department store salons located within malls, in-home hair services, booth rentals and blow dry bars. The Company also faces competition from other franchise organizations outside of the hair salon industry in attracting new franchisees.
At the individual salon level, barriers to entry are low; however, barriers exist for chains to expand nationally due to the need to establish systems and infrastructure, the ability to recruit franchisees, experienced field and salon management and stylists, and to lease quality sites. The principal factors of competition in the hair care category are quality and consistency of the guest experience, the ability to attract, retain, and train stylists, technology, convenience, location and price. The Company continually strives to improve its performance in each of these areas and to create additional points of brand differentiation versus the competition.
Salon Franchising Program:
General.    We have various franchise support functions our 5,395 franchised salons as of June 30, 2022, consisting mainly of Supercuts, SmartStyle, Cost Cutters, First Choice Haircutters and Roosters salons. We provide our franchisees with a comprehensive system of business training, stylist education, site approval, professional marketing, promotion, and advertising programs, and other forms of ongoing support designed to help franchisees build successful businesses. Historically, we have signed the salon lease and then subleased the space to our franchisees. However, moving forward, for all new locations and some lease renewals, franchisees will seek to sign the salon leases directly with the landlords; however, there may be cases where we decide to stay on the lease. We have the right to approve salon leases.
Standards of Operations.    The Company does not control the day-to-day operations of its franchisees, including employment, benefits and wage determination, prices charged for products and services, business hours, personnel management, and capital expenditure decisions. However, the franchise agreements afford certain rights to the Company, such as the right to approve locations, suppliers and the sale of a franchise. Additionally, franchisees are required to conform to the Company's established operational policies and procedures relating to quality of service, training, salon design and decor and trademark usage. The Company's field personnel make periodic visits to franchised salons to ensure they are operating in conformity with the standards for each franchising program. All of the rights afforded to the Company with regard to franchised operations allow the Company to protect its brands, but do not allow the Company to control day-to-day franchise operations or make decisions that have a significant impact on the success of the franchised salons. The Company's franchise agreements do not give the Company any right, ability or potential to determine or otherwise influence any terms and/or conditions of employment of franchisees' employees (except for those, if any, that are specifically related to quality of service, training, salon design, decor and trademark usage), including, but not limited to, franchisees' employees' wages and benefits, hours of work, scheduling, leave programs, seniority rights, promotional or transfer opportunities, layoff/recall arrangements, grievance and dispute resolution procedures, and/or discipline and discharge. 
Franchise Terms.    Pursuant to a franchise agreement with the Company, each franchisee pays an initial fee for each store and ongoing royalties to the Company. In addition, for most brands, the Company collects advertising funds from franchisees and administers the funds on behalf of the brands. Franchisees are responsible for the costs of leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, equipment, supplies, inventory, payroll costs and certain other items, including initial working capital. The majority of franchise agreements provide the Company a right of first refusal if the store is to be sold and the franchisee must obtain the Company's approval in all instances where there is a sale of a franchise location.
Additional information regarding each of the major franchised brands is listed below:
Supercuts
Supercuts franchise agreements have a perpetual term, subject to termination of the underlying lease agreement or termination of the franchise agreement by either the Company or the franchisee. All new franchisees enter into development agreements, which give them the right to enter into a defined number of franchise agreements. These franchise agreements are site specific. The development agreement provides limited territorial protection for the stores developed under those franchise agreements. Older franchisees have grandfathered expansion rights, which allow them to develop stores outside of development agreements and provide them with greater territorial protections in their markets. The Company has a comprehensive impact policy that resolves potential conflicts among Supercuts franchisees and/or the Company's Supercuts locations regarding proposed store sites.
SmartStyle and Cost Cutters in Walmart Supercenters 
The majority of existing SmartStyle and Cost Cutters franchise agreements for salons located in Walmart Supercenters have a five-year term with a five-year option to renew. The franchise agreements are site specific. 
Cost Cutters (not located in Walmart Supercenters), First Choice Haircutters and Magicuts
The majority of existing Cost Cutters franchise agreements have a 15-year term with a 15-year option to renew (at the option of the franchisee), while the majority of First Choice Haircutters franchise agreements have a 10-year term with a five-year option to renew. The majority of Magicuts franchise agreements have a term equal to the greater of five years or the current initial term of the lease agreement with an option to renew for two additional five-year periods. The current franchise agreement is site specific. Franchisees may enter into development agreements with the Company, which provide limited territorial protection.
Roosters Menâ€™s Grooming Center
Roosters franchise agreements have a 10-year term with a 10-year option to renew (at the option of the franchisee). New franchisees enter into a franchise agreement concurrent with the opening of their first store, along with a development agreement with the right to open two additional locations. 
Franchisee Training.    The Company provides new franchisees with training, focusing on the various aspects of salon management, including: operations, management training, marketing fundamentals and controls. Existing franchisees receive training, counseling and information from the Company on a regular basis. The Company provides franchisee salon managers and stylists with access to technical training resources.
Guests
Among other factors, consistent delivery of an exceptional guest experience, haircut quality, convenience, competitive pricing, salon location, inviting salon appearance and atmosphere, comprehensive retail assortments, and engagement through technology all drive guest traffic and improve guest retention.
Guest Experience. Our portfolio of salon concepts enables our guests to select different service scheduling options based upon their preference. We believe the ability to serve walk-in appointments and minimize guest wait times are essential elements in delivering an efficient guest experience. Our mobile applications and online check-in capabilities, including check-ins directly from GoogleÂ®, allow us to capitalize on our guests' desire for convenience. Our franchisees continue to focus on stylist staffing and retention, optimizing schedules, balancing variable labor hours with guest traffic and managing guest wait times. Our franchise salons are located in high-traffic strip centers and Walmart Supercenters, with guest parking and easy access, and are generally open seven days per week to offer guests a variety of convenient ways to fulfill their beauty needs. 
Affordability. The Company strives to offer an exceptional value for its services. In the value category, our guests expect outstanding service at competitive prices. These expectations are met with the average service price of transactions ranging from $20 to $28. Pricing decisions are considered on a salon-level basis and are established based on local conditions. Our franchisees control all pricing at their locations.
Salon Safety, Appearance and Atmosphere. Guest and stylist safety is our first priority and became even more important by the novel strain of coronavirus and all related variants (COVID-19). We have invested heavily in safety and personal protective equipment and training employees on safety measures. Our salon repairs and maintenance program is designed to ensure we invest in salon cleanliness and safety, as well as in maintaining the normal operation of our company-owned salons. The Company's salons range from 500 to 5,000 square feet, with the typical salon approximating 1,200 square feet. 
Retail Assortments. Salons sell nationally recognized hair care and beauty products, as well as an assortment of corporate-owned brand products. Stylists are compensated and regularly trained to sell hair care and beauty products to their guests. Additionally, guests are encouraged to purchase products after stylists demonstrate their efficacy by using them in the styling of our guests' hair. The top selling brands within the Company's retail assortment include: L'Oreal Professional Brands, Regis Private Label Brand, DesignlineÂ®, and Paul Mitchell. We also distribute our Designline brand through distribution channels, including Amazon.com and Walmart.com. 
Technology.  In fiscal year 2022, we sold our proprietary back-office salon management system, OpensalonÂ® Pro to a third party, Zenoti. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K. We expect all of our salons will transition to the Zenoti salon management system in fiscal year 2023. We also use mobile applications to allow guests to view wait times and interact in other ways with salons.
Marketing. Our marketing is brand specific and funded primarily from contractual contributions, based on sales, to the brand's cooperative advertising funds. These funds are used largely in support of advertising and other efforts to increase guest traffic to our salons, grow online booking usage, and improve overall awareness of and affinity for our brands. A portion of our marketing funds are used in support of stylist recruitment to grow the number of active stylists in our system.
Stylists
Our Company depends on its stylists to help deliver great guest experiences. We believe in the importance of the ongoing development of our stylists' craft. We aim to be an industry leader in stylist training, including the utilization of both live and digital training. Our stylists deliver a superior experience for our guests when they are well-trained technically and through years of experience. We employ trainers who provide new hire training for stylists joining the Company and train franchisee trainers. We supplement internal training with targeted vendor training and external trainers that bring specialized expertise to our stylists. We utilize training materials to help all levels of field employees navigate the operation of a salon and essential elements of guest service training within the context of brand positions. 
Salon Support
Our corporate headquarters is referred to as Salon Support. We take a service-oriented mentality to best support our franchisees and stylists in an effort to ensure guest satisfaction by helping our franchisees drive their business, as well as overseeing our company-owned operations.
Organization. Salon Support and our associated priorities are aligned with our brands to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the service we provide.
Simplification. Our ongoing simplification efforts focus on aligning our cost structure with our transition to an asset-light franchise model and improving the way we plan and execute across our portfolio of brands. In fiscal year 2022 and 2021, we completed a corporate reorganization based on a zero-based budgeting philosophy to ensure each employee was performing the "right work," each team was the "right size" based on resources and priorities and overall, we have the "right structure" to succeed as a company. This exercise reduced Salon Support headcount in fiscal year 2022 and 2021. 
Location. Salon Support is primarily located in Minneapolis, Minnesota while allowing for hybrid and remote work.

These values support a collaborative and inclusive culture that is critical to the success and growth of our Company. To help reinforce our values and incorporate them into everything we do, we have a values committee comprised of cultural ambassadors who serve as the voice of employees and help ensure a best-in-class employee experience.

It also offers flexible work arrangements, including full-time telecommuting.

Governmental Regulations:
The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and provincial laws affecting its business, as well as a variety of regulatory provisions relating to the conduct of its beauty-related business, including health and safety. At the end of fiscal year 2020, the majority of state and local governments where we operate temporarily mandated the closure of our salons in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic. These pandemic related government-mandated closures continued into fiscal year 2021 and even into fiscal year 2022 in parts of Canada. We monitor state and local regulations carefully to ensure the safety of our stylists and guests.
In the United States, the Company's franchise operations are subject to the Federal Trade Commission's Trade Regulation Rule on Franchising (the FTC Rule) and by state laws and administrative regulations that regulate various aspects of franchise operations and sales. The Company's franchises are offered to franchisees by means of a disclosure document containing specified disclosures in accordance with the FTC Rule and the laws and regulations of certain states. The Company has registered its offering of franchises with the regulatory authorities of those states in which it offers franchises and where registration is required. State laws that regulate the franchisee/franchisor relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and, in certain cases, apply substantive standards to this relationship. Such laws may, for example, require that the franchisor deal with the franchisee in good faith, prohibit interference with the right of free association among franchisees, and limit termination of franchisees without payment of reasonable compensation. The Company believes that the current trend is for government regulation of franchising to increase over time. However, such laws have not had, and the Company does not expect such laws to have, a significant effect on the Company's operations.
In Canada, the Company's franchise operations are subject to franchise laws and regulations in the provinces of Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia. The offering of franchises in Canada occurs by way of a disclosure document, which contains certain disclosures required by the applicable provincial laws. The provincial franchise laws and regulations primarily focus on disclosure requirements, although each requires certain relationship requirements, such as a duty of fair dealing and the right of franchisees to associate and organize with other franchisees.
The Company believes it is operating in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing all of its operations.
The Company maintains an ownership interest in Empire Education Group, Inc. Beauty schools derive a significant portion of their revenue from student financial assistance originating from the U.S. Department of Education's Title IV Higher Education Act of 1965. For the students to receive financial assistance at the schools, the beauty schools must maintain eligibility requirements established by the U.S. Department of Education. In 2020, the Company signed an agreement to sell our ownership interest in EEG to the other owner. The transaction is expected to close after receipt of state ownership transfer approvals.
