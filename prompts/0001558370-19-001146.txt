 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 Overview 
 We are a global, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies for rare diseases with significant unmet needs. 
 Our first commercial product is Keveyis (dichlorphenamide), the first and only treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for hyperkalemic, hypokalemic, and related variants of primary periodic paralysis (“PPP”), a group of rare hereditary neuromuscular disorders that cause episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis. 
 In January 2018, Strongbridge Ireland Ltd., one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired the U.S. and Canadian rights to Macrilen (macimorelin), the first and only oral drug approved by the FDA for the diagnosis of patients with adult growth hormone deficiency. We launched Macrilen in the United States in July 2018. In December 2018, we sold Strongbridge Ireland Ltd. to Novo Nordisk Healthcare AG (“Novo”) for $145 million plus tiered royalties on net sales of Macrilen through 2027. In addition, Strongbridge U.S. Inc, another of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into an agreement with Novo Nordisk Inc., a subsidiary of Novo (“NNI”), pursuant to which NNI will fund the costs of 23 of our field-based employees to provide full-time ongoing services to NNI, including the promotion of Macrilen in the United States, for a period of three years. Novo also purchased 5.2 million of our ordinary shares at a purchase price of $7.00 per share.

We have two clinical-stage product candidates for rare endocrine diseases, Recorlev and veldoreotide. Recorlev (levoketoconazole) is a cortisol synthesis inhibitor currently being studied for the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. Veldoreotide is a next-generation somatostatin analog being investigated for potential applications in conditions amenable to somatostatin receptor activation, such as acromegaly. Both Recorlev and veldoreotide have received orphan designation from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”).
 We are building a rare disease, franchise-based business model focused on expansion through a disciplined in-licensing and acquisition strategy. We will continue to identify and evaluate the acquisition of products and product candidates for licensing or acquisition that would be complementary to our existing rare neuromuscular and endocrine franchises or that would form the basis for new rare disease franchises. We believe this approach will enable us to maximize our commercial potential by further leveraging our existing resources and expertise.

 Rare Endocrine Franchise

· | Macrilen (macimorelin), an oral growth hormone secretagogue receptor agonist, is indicated for the diagnosis of AGHD. In December 2018, we sold our subsidiary that held the U.S. and Canadian marketing rights to Macrilen to Novo Nordisk for $145 million and the right to receive tiered royalties on net sales of Macrilen by Novo through 2027. In addition, Novo will fund the costs of 23 of our field-based employees to provide full-time ongoing services to Novo, including the promotion of Macrilen in the United States, for a period of three years

· | Recorlev (levoketoconazole), a cortisol synthesis inhibitor, is in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. Endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by sustained elevated cortisol levels that most commonly result from a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. We believe that Recorlev, which is the isolated, “left-handed” mirror image, or enantiomer, of ketoconazole, has the potential to become the new standard of care for the drug therapy of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. In August 2018, we announced top-line results from our multinational, pivotal Phase 3 SONICS study evaluating Recorlev for treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. The

open-label, single-arm SONICS study achieved statistical significance of its pre-specified primary endpoint, with 30 percent of patients achieving normalization of mean urinary free cortisol (“UFC”) following six months of maintenance treatment with Recorlev without a dose increase during maintenance therapy (one-sided p=.0154, vs the null hypothesis of less than or equal to 20%). Sensitivity analyses as well as secondary and exploratory endpoints of UFC response were supportive of the primary endpoint.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In addition, we have initiated LOGICS, a second Phase 3 clinical trial of Recorlev for the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. The LOGICS study will supplement the long-term efficacy and safety data from the SONICS trial via a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal phase of approximately 8 weeks among 54 patients that follows an open-label titration and maintenance phase of approximately 14 weeks. Top-line data following the randomized-withdrawal phase of LOGICS are expected by the end of 2019.  
 Upon completion of the clinical development program, we intend to file for marketing authorizations in the United States and elsewhere. Following consultations with the FDA, we have determined that the 505(b)(2) approval pathway, which permits a New Drug Application (“NDA”) applicant to rely on data from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, is the appropriate pathway for a Recorlev NDA. Because NDA approval can rely in part on data already accepted by the FDA or otherwise publicly available, an abbreviated and reduced development program may be possible. We intend to rely on published literature and the FDA’s prior findings concerning the safety and/or effectiveness of ketoconazole in our NDA for Recorlev. A similar marketing authorization pathway is available in most of the rest of the world, and we believe that the studies supporting U.S. approval will likewise support approvals to market Recorlev elsewhere, including in the European Union.    
· | Veldoreotide modified-release, a novel multi-receptor targeted somatostatin analog (“SSA”) that was previously in Phase 2 development as an immediate release formulation. Based on the differentiated activation pattern of somatostatin receptor subtypes (“SSTs”) and the preclinical and clinical profile of immediate-release veldoreotide, we believe that modified-release veldoreotide is a next-generation somatostatin analog with potential applications in conditions amenable to somatostatin receptor activation, such as acromegaly. Veldoreotide has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and the EMA for treatment of acromegaly. The lead formulation for veldoreotide modified-release is based upon PLGA microspheres. PLGA is a well-known polymer, which has been widely applied in modified-release formulations due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and favorable release kinetics. We have initiated nonclinical studies and are planning clinical studies that seek to determine additional differentiating features of veldoreotide in both endocrine and non-endocrine conditions.

  Rare Neuromuscular Franchise 

· | Keveyis (dichlorphenamide), an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and the only therapy approved in the United States to treat hyperkalemic, hypokalemic and related variants of PPP. PPP is a rare genetic, neuromuscular disorder that can cause extreme muscle weakness and/or paralysis; some forms are also commonly associated with myotonia or muscle stiffness. It often interferes with daily activities and, as patients get older, it can lead to permanent muscle weakness. The two most common forms of this disorder are “hyperkalemic” and “hypokalemic” periodic paralysis. Keveyis was approved by the FDA in August 2015 and has orphan drug exclusivity status in the United States through August 7, 2022. From May 2016 to December 2016, Taro Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. and its affiliates (“Taro”), supplied Keveyis on a non-commercial basis to patients through a single specialty pharmacy in the United States. We acquired the U.S. marketing rights to Keveyis in December 2016 and we launched Keveyis in the United States in April 2017.

  Product Sales
 Our product sales in 2018 resulted from sales of Keveyis and Macrilen. In December 2018, we sold our subsidiary that held the U.S. and Canadian marketing rights to Macrilen to Novo. All of our sales were in the United

States. We operate in one operating reporting segment. We recognize net product sales at the time our products are received by our customers (primarily wholesalers and specialty pharmacies). The products are subsequently sold to patients, who are covered by payors that may provide for government-mandated or privately negotiated rebates with respect to the purchase of our products.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to transform the lives of patients by building a leading franchise‑based, commercially oriented biopharmaceutical company addressing rare diseases with significant unmet medical needs. We are focused on developing, in‑licensing, acquiring and eventually commercializing products and product candidates that target rare diseases across various therapeutic areas.
 To achieve our goal, we are pursuing the following strategies:

· | Focus on rare diseases, including development of Recorlev. We are selling or developing treatments for rare diseases, initially PPP and endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. Rare diseases typically have a high unmet need for innovative treatment options. Drug development for the treatment of rare diseases often requires smaller clinical trials than for common diseases. Product candidates focused on rare diseases also often qualify for orphan drug designation, which in the United States provides for seven years of market exclusivity and in the European Union provides for 10 years of market exclusivity after regulatory approval to market has been granted.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Independently commercialize Keveyis and other products in the United States and the European Union, while providing commercial services to Novo in order to generate additional revenue. We launched Keveyis in the United States in April 2017 and marketed Macrilen in the United States from July to December 2018, when we sold our subsidiary that held the U.S. and Canadian marketing rights to Novo. Our other rare disease product candidates, if approved, may be marketed in the United States, the European Union, and, selectively, in other key global markets. Given the relatively small prescriber bases for Keveyis and our two product candidates, we believe we can use a relatively small, focused field-based team to effectively promote and support our products and patients. We have established sales, marketing, market access and patient service capabilities in the United States to market Keveyis and we will continue to promote Macrilen on behalf of Novo pursuant to our agreement with them for a three-year period. We believe that some of the activities involved in our commercialization activities related to Keveyis and Macrilen will provide synergies to our commercialization of Recorlev if successful. We believe that our ability to execute on this strategy is enhanced by the significant prior commercial experience of key members of our management team. Prior to joining our company, members of our management team were involved in the launch or commercialization of over 20 pharmaceutical products.

· | Provide Commercial Services to Novo Nordisk for the promotion of Macrilen. As part of the transaction in December 2018, in which we sold our U.S. and Canada marketing rights to Novo Nordisk, we will receive tiered royalties on sales of Macrilen through 2027. In addition, we entered into a services agreement with Novo pursuant to which Novo will fund the costs of 23 of our field-based employees to provide full-time ongoing services to Novo, including the promotion of Macrilen in the United States, for a period of three years.

· | Expand our portfolio through a disciplined in‑licensing and acquisition strategy. We plan to source new product candidates by in‑licensing or acquiring them. Our management team seeks to mitigate the potential risks of this strategy by adhering to our disciplined criteria of focusing on in‑licensing or acquisition of products that are already commercially available or that have human clinical data that we believe suggest a relatively high probability of success for development and an attractive potential return on investment. As a result of our management team’s experience in sourcing, selecting, in‑licensing, and acquiring products and product candidates, we were successful in acquiring the U.S. rights to Keveyis and the U.S. and Canadian rights to Macrilen, as well as augmenting our rare endocrine franchise by adding veldoreotide to our product pipeline.

 Our Rare Endocrine Franchise 
 Macrilen 
 In January of 2018, Strongbridge Ireland Ltd., one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired the U.S. and Canadian rights to Macrilen (macimorelin), the first and only oral drug approved by the FDA for the diagnosis of patients with adult growth hormone deficiency. We launched Macrilen in the United States in July 2018. 
 In December 2018, we sold Strongbridge Ireland Ltd. to Novo Nordisk (“Novo”) for $145 million plus tiered royalties on net sales of Macrilen through 2027. Between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2021, Novo will pay to us 12% of annual net sales of Macrilen in the United States. Between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2027, Novo will pay to us (i) 4% of any portion of annual net sales in the United States up to $100 million and (ii) 8% of any portion of annual net sales in the United States greater than $100 million. The royalty payments are subject to certain conditions and reductions, including if Macrilen is no longer covered by a valid claim of a patent in the United States or Novo or its affiliates no longer hold exclusive marketing rights granted by the FDA. In addition, we entered into a services agreement with Novo pursuant to which Novo will fund the costs of 23 of our field-based employees to provide full-time ongoing services to Novo, including the promotion of Macrilen in the United States, for a period of three years. We will also be entitled to a performance fee of up to $1.5 million per contract year if certain conditions are met by our field-

based employees under the services arrangement, which conditions will be determined and measured by a joint committee comprised of members from Novo and from Strongbridge, with a majority of members from Novo.
 Recorlev
 Overview
 Recorlev (levoketoconazole) is a cortisol synthesis inhibitor that we are developing for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. The active pharmaceutical ingredient in Recorlev, levoketoconazole, exerts its therapeutic effect by blocking the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal glands, leading to the reduction and, ideally, the normalization of blood cortisol. Recorlev has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and the EMA and is being developed using a dose regimen of twice daily oral administration. 
     Ketoconazole, although not approved for such use in the United States, is the most frequently prescribed drug therapy for endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. It is used to reduce blood cortisol and ameliorate comorbidities associated with Cushing’s syndrome. Molecules of ketoconazole form as mirror images, referred to as enantiomers. Manufactured ketoconazole consists of two enantiomers, 2R,4S‑ketoconazole and 2S,4R‑ketoconazole, that are found in equal amounts, and is therefore referred to as a racemate. Recorlev is a pure form of one (2S,4R‑ketoconazole) of the two enantiomers of ketoconazole. Single‑enantiomer drugs, like Recorlev, may offer safety and efficacy advantages over racemates because one of the enantiomers in a racemate can have safety issues or be less effective in the treatment of the disorder or disease. The more therapeutically favorable enantiomer may be known as the eutomer. We believe that levoketoconazole is the eutomer of ketoconazole with respect to cortisol synthesis inhibition and treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome.
 Recorlev inhibits the cortisol synthesis pathway at several points. Based on recent top-line interim results from the SONICS study, we believe that Recorlev can have a beneficial impact on hypercortisolism, the hallmark of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, as well as benefits related to several comorbidities of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, including those associated with cardiovascular disease risk, such as diabetes, weight gain and elevation in LDL-cholesterol. In addition, we believe that Recorlev may offer an advantageous safety profile in a representative population with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. We believe that Recorlev has the potential to become a new standard of care for chronic drug therapy of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome due to its demonstrated clinical properties. 
 Overview of Endogenous Cushing’s Syndrome 
 There are two variants of Cushing’s syndrome: exogenous, which is caused by factors outside the body (e.g., corticosteroid or cortisol-like medications) and endogenous, which is caused by factors within the body. The signs and symptoms may be the same in both forms. The more common form is exogenous Cushing’s syndrome, which is often found in people taking cortisol‑like medications for long periods of time or for shorter periods of time using very potent forms. Cortisol‑like medications are often used to treat inflammatory disorders such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, exogenous Cushing’s syndrome may be alleviated by withdrawing the inciting medication.
 Endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by sustained elevated blood cortisol. Cortisol is a hormone produced in the adrenal gland and is naturally secreted as an end-product of the activity of the hypothalamic‑pituitary‑adrenal axis. Corticotropin‑releasing‑hormone (“CRH”) is secreted from the hypothalamus and stimulates the secretion and release of adrenocorticotropin (“ACTH”) from the pituitary gland, which in turn stimulates cortisol (and other hormone) secretion from the adrenal gland. Cortisol itself exerts negative feedback control on both CRH in the hypothalamus and ACTH in the pituitary gland, thereby reducing CRH and ACTH secretion, keeping cortisol levels in a normal range.
 The most common form of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is called Cushing’s disease, which is typically caused by a benign pituitary tumor that secretes ACTH autonomously. Cushing’s disease represents approximately 70% to 80% of patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. Other causes of endogenous ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome include extrapituitary tumors producing ACTH, known as ectopic ACTH, or less often CRH (ectopic CRH). 

 
  8

 
The source of ectopic ACTH/CRH secretion is most often small‑cell carcinoma of the lung or bronchial carcinoid tumors but neuroendocrine tumors found in many different organs can also be sources. In a smaller number of cases, approximately 20%, endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is ACTH‑independent, meaning that it does not arise through tumor secretion of ACTH but rather results from excess secretion of cortisol itself in the adrenal gland by adrenocortical tumors, either benign or malignant, or by non‑malignant enlargement of the adrenal glands called hyperplasia.
 In patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, the normal feedback mechanisms of the hypothalamic‑pituitary‑adrenal axis are disrupted as a result of a tumor autonomously secreting ACTH, CRH or cortisol. This causes chronic exposure to high circulating cortisol levels that give rise to the clinical state of Cushing’s syndrome. The most common signs and symptoms of the syndrome include: weight gain, especially in the upper body with a rounded face (“moon face”) and extra fat on the upper back and above the collarbones; high blood sugar or diabetes mellitus; high blood pressure or hypertension; thin bones or osteoporosis; muscle loss or sarcopenia; thin, fragile skin that bruises easily; purple‑red stretch marks called striae, usually over the abdomen and under the arms; depression and difficulty thinking clearly; too much facial hair, or hirsutism, usually noticed only in women; irregular or absent menstrual periods and infertility; reduced sex drive or libido; and in children, poor height growth.
 An estimated 25,000 patients in the United States and 40,000 patients in Europe are diagnosed with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. When first diagnosed, patients are most commonly adults aged 20 to 50 and five times more often women than men. However, endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is believed to be underdiagnosed due to lack of disease recognition, which often leads to a delay in diagnosis of six years on average. Endogenous Cushing’s syndrome patients are believed to have a mortality risk two to three times that of the age-and-gender-matched general population, with cardiovascular disease, venous thrombosis and infections being the primary causes of death.
 Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations on Current Treatment Options
 Treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome varies depending on the cause of the disease. For patients with Cushing’s disease, initial treatment is almost always the attempted surgical removal of the pituitary tumor. In anticipation of surgery and when surgery is not effective or not feasible, drug or radiation therapy, or both, is used to suppress excessive cortisol production and the accompanying clinical symptoms. 

A typical approach to drug therapy is to inhibit cortisol synthesis through the oral administration of an inhibitor of enzymes that regulate adrenal cortisol synthesis. Ketoconazole acts in this way and is the most widely used drug therapy for endogenous Cushing’s syndrome in the United States. Although approved in the European Union for this indication, ketoconazole is not approved for this indication by the FDA and is therefore prescribed “off-label”. The percentage of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome patients treated with ketoconazole monotherapy who achieve normalized levels of cortisol, assessed by measuring UFC has been reported from retrospective, uncontrolled studies, with varying definitions of normalization, to be between 33% and 100%. Data from a recent retrospective study of 200 patients in 14 French centers solely treated with ketoconazole for endogenous Cushing’s syndrome between 1995 and 2012 suggested that ketoconazole controlled cortisol in approximately 50% of patients and likewise improved clinical symptoms. Also, beneficial effects of oral ketoconazole on clinical symptoms and signs that drive the morbidity and mortality of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome have been reported including reduction in high blood pressure, improvement of diabetes, and normalization of hypokalemia, or low potassium blood levels. However, some patients treated with ketoconazole experience tolerability issues and, in some cases, liver injury (also known as hepatotoxicity). As a result of the hepatotoxicity risk, the FDA has issued a boxed warning to prescribers in the labeling describing the use of ketoconazole to treat fungal infections, the only approved indication for ketoconazole in the United States. The FDA has also cautioned that safety and effectiveness have not been established for off-label use of ketoconazole in Cushing’s syndrome. Although elevations in liver enzymes associated with ketoconazole are generally mild to moderate and reversible upon cessation of drug, in rare cases, severe hepatotoxicity may occur (estimated as one in every 10,000 to 15,000 patients). In extremely rare cases, ketoconazole-related liver injury may be irreversible and result in death or require liver transplantation. In July 2013, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) recommended that ketoconazole be withdrawn for use as an antifungal agent in the European Union. The EMA adopted the CHMP recommendation in August 2013, and the recommendation was subsequently confirmed by the European Commission. In September 2014, HRA Pharma received a recommendation of approval from the EMA for ketoconazole

for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, based on the well‑established use of ketoconazole in medical practice as well as documentation from retrospective studies in the literature.
 An alternative medical approach to treating Cushing’s syndrome targets pituitary tumors that produce ACTH (i.e., in Cushing’s disease). Among Cushing’s disease patients, the dopamine agonist cabergoline, which is not approved for use to treat Cushing’s disease in the United States, has been shown to achieve normalization of UFC levels, gold-standard evidence of disease control, in about 30% of patients. The SSA pasireotide, which is marketed as Signifor® and Signifor LAR for the treatment of Cushing’s disease in the United States, has shown normalization of UFC levels with stable dosing of the immediate-release formulation in 15% of patients at a dosage of 600 µg twice-daily and in 26% of patients at a dosage of 900 µg twice-daily over a 6-month period. Certain SSAs, including Signifor, are known to have undesirable side effects on glucose metabolism. Forty percent of patients with Cushing’s disease treated with Signifor in its Phase 3 clinical trial reported the occurrence of hyperglycemia‑related adverse events, and in the cohort receiving Signifor 900 µg twice-daily, glycated hemoglobin (“HbA1c”) increased from 5.8% at baseline to 7.3% at Month 6.
 Another alternative drug therapy, Korlym, or mifepristone, works by inhibiting the action of cortisol at the cortisol-receptor level but does not lower blood cortisol levels, which actually tend to increase during therapy. As a result of this mechanism of action, it is not possible to monitor response (i.e., effectiveness and safety) to Korlym by measuring UFC or cortisol levels (from blood or saliva), which are the standard ways clinicians monitor disease progression and response to treatment. As a result, Korlym is usually titrated and monitored through use of clinical signs and symptoms improvements (e.g., blood sugar reductions). Korlym has been approved in the United States to control hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome who also have diabetes mellitus. About one-third of patients with endogenous Cushing syndrome have diabetes. Korlym is contraindicated in pregnant women and in women with a history of unexplained vaginal bleeding, as its side effects include termination of pregnancy, endometrial thickening and vaginal bleeding. It is also frequently associated with hypokalemia.
 We believe that the efficacy and usage limitations and safety concerns associated with currently available drug therapies for endogenous Cushing’s syndrome are an important reason why a significant unmet medical need exists among endogenous Cushing’s syndrome patients with persistent or recurrent disease post-surgery. In a survey we commissioned in 2014 of 89 U.S. physicians treating patients with Cushing’s syndrome, when asked, “Of your patients on medication to manage cortisol levels, what percentage are well controlled?”, the physicians estimated that only approximately 37% of such patients were well controlled. A recent multicenter study of 230 Cushing’s disease patients followed for up to 27.5 years and treated with any modality (i.e., surgery, radiation or drugs) found that only 49% had documented biochemical control. We believe that our potential addressable market for Recorlev includes diagnosed endogenous Cushing’s syndrome patients that at any time are eligible for drug therapy, including patients anticipating surgery, for whom surgery or radiation is not feasible, is contraindicated or has been unsuccessful. This unmet need may also be impacted by what we believe to be the current lack of disease awareness among physicians and patients, resulting in a relatively low rate of diagnosis.
 Our Solution—Recorlev 
 We believe that Recorlev has the potential to become a new standard of care for the drug therapy of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome because it may provide a favorable efficacy, safety and tolerability profile compared to current drug therapies, including ketoconazole. Based on interim results of the SONICS study, Recorlev effectively reduces UFC, in contrast to Korlym, and demonstrates anti‑hyperglycemic effects, in contrast to Signifor. In addition, we believe Recorlev may have an improved safety profile compared with that of ketoconazole.

 Recorlev, like ketoconazole, is a cortisol synthesis inhibitor that inhibits the cortisol synthesis pathway at multiple points. The following graphic illustrates the cortisol synthesis pathway:

 Preclinical and pharmacokinetic data provide evidence that the presumed efficacy of ketoconazole to treat hypercortisolism is due to the ability of levoketoconazole to inhibit adrenal cortisol synthesis. This conclusion is inferred from evidence that the antipode of levoketoconazole (dextroketoconazole) is a far less potent inhibitor of cortisol synthesis in vitro. Furthermore, the relatively greater potency of levoketoconazole to inhibit cortisol (and androgen) synthesis implies that, all else being equal, a lower dose of levoketoconazole could result in the same or better efficacy as a higher dose of ketoconazole, thus potentially reducing the risk of toxicity, such as liver toxicity, if such toxicity is contributed approximately equally by each enantiomer of ketoconazole. These conclusions are based on the following:

· | In in vitro studies, Recorlev was found to have markedly higher potency than ketoconazole and its mirror‑image enantiomer, 2R,4S‑ketoconazole, in inhibiting the key enzymes in cortisol synthesis (CYP11B1, CYP17, and CYP21). The inhibitory potency in vitro of levoketoconazole on these enzymes is approximately twice that of ketoconazole, precisely the ratio that would be expected if levoketoconazole accounted for essentially all of the in vitro potency. Combined with the pharmacokinetic profile of the enantiomers (below), these data suggest that essentially all in vivo cortisol inhibition observed following administration of ketoconazole can be ascribed to the single 2S,4R enantiomer (levoketoconazole, the active ingredient of Recorlev).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers also suggest a potentially larger therapeutic index of Recorlev relative to ketoconazole. The two enantiomers found within ketoconazole are present in equal amounts, but in a Phase 1 clinical study in healthy subjects, it was observed that administration of ketoconazole resulted in integrated blood concentrations (i.e., exposure) of the single enantiomer, 2S,4R‑ketoconazole (i.e., Recorlev) that exceeded those of the other enantiomer, 2R,4S‑ketoconazole, by approximately three times. This observation suggests either that (i) 2R,4S‑ketoconazole is extracted by the liver to a greater extent than the other single enantiomer, 2S,4R‑ketoconazole (i.e., Recorlev), and may therefore contribute more than Recorlev to the observed liver toxicity of ketoconazole or (ii) 2S,4R-ketoconazole is preferentially absorbed. Even if the liver-clearance of the enantiomers is not different, the higher blood levels of 2S,4R-ketoconazole upon dosing with racemate suggest that a lower amount of drug administration of the single 2S,4R enantiomer (levoketoconazole) may result in equivalent efficacy to a higher amount of drug administration of ketoconazole, assuming that 2S,4R-ketoconazole accounts for essentially all of the in vivo cortisol inhibition of the racemate (ketoconazole—see above).

· | Compared with ketoconazole, it was observed in in vitro studies that Recorlev is less potent than the other enantiomer (i.e., its antipode, 2R,4S-ketoconazole) in inhibiting the activity of CYP7A. CYP7A is the first

and rate‑limiting enzyme for production of bile acids in the liver. While a role of CYP7A in liver injury is not established, this finding suggests a possible differential effect of the ketoconazole enantiomers on metabolic and detoxifying enzymes in the liver contributing to reduced hepatotoxicity potential of Recorlev.

· | Preliminary evidence from studies performed in vitro using primary human hepatocytes suggests that at relevant pharmacological concentrations there are distinct differences between ketoconazole enantiomers in their propensity to perturb metabolic functions of the cells that favor levoketoconazole over its antipode (2R,4S-ketoconazole) or ketoconazole. Such differences are believed to be relevant clinically as they suggest differences in the potency of these compounds to induce metabolic abnormalities that are believed to be responsible for a condition known as oxidative stress (an imbalance between oxidizing free radicals and the molecules that neutralize them, known as antioxidants). It is believed that oxidative stress may be an early event in the pathogenesis of liver injury from many different drugs, including ketoconazole.

  Previously, levoketoconazole (then called DIO-902) was studied clinically for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. DiObex, our licensee from 2004 to 2008, initiated three clinical trials to investigate the use of levoketoconazole for treatment of type 2 diabetes and two clinical drug-drug interaction studies in healthy volunteers. Results from these studies established the clinical pharmacology profile of levoketoconazole, contributed to an understanding of its potential efficacy in type 2 diabetes and established preliminary clinical safety and tolerability profiles.
 Thirty-seven patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (“T2DM”) were enrolled in a Phase 1/2a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study and administered levoketoconazole at 200, 400, or 600 mg once daily (QD), ketoconazole 400 mg QD, or placebo, for 14 days (Study DIO-501). A total of 21 patients with T2DM received levoketoconazole. Levels of LDL-cholesterol were significantly decreased in patients treated with levoketoconazole. Non-significant trends suggestive of improvement in glycemic control and reduction in cortisol secretion relative to placebo were observed.
 Administration of levoketoconazole in patients with T2DM was safe and well tolerated. Headache and nausea were the most frequently reported adverse events (“AE”), some of which were considered drug-related. No clinically significant changes in hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis were noted in any treatment group. No treatment-related changes in markers of liver injury (LFTs) were reported. Plasma area under the concentration-time curves (AUCs) and maximum concentration (Cmax) increased in a non-proportional manner over the dose range of 200 mg to 400 mg; clearance was decreased at 600 mg QD.
 Two Phase 2b studies (one main study plus an open-label extension) designed to evaluate the efficacy of levoketoconazole in combination with atorvastatin in patients with T2DM were voluntarily terminated early due to the perceived high regulatory and commercial hurdles for the approval and use of levoketoconazole in T2DM at the time of development in 2008, given the emerging benefits and risks profile observed. Study DIO-502 was a 4-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, eight-arm dose-ranging trial of levoketoconazole (150 mg to 450 mg QD) with concomitant administration of metformin and either atorvastatin 10 mg or matching placebo for atorvastatin 10 mg. Study DIO-503 was an open-label, follow-on extension to Study DIO-502 to evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics after 24 weeks of dosing with levoketoconazole in combination with metformin and atorvastatin or placebo in patients with T2DM. At the time of study terminations, of 133 patients enrolled in the combined studies, 129 were treated, and 97 received at least one dose of levoketoconazole. A total of 47 patients received treatment with levoketoconazole between one and three months duration, while 38 patients exceeded three months of dosing. The frequency of AEs reported was generally similar across treatment arms. Diarrhea was the most frequently reported AE overall with administration of levoketoconazole. No SAEs were reported in the terminated studies.
 A safety signal of elevated serum transaminases was identified in the DIO-502 and DIO-503 studies. Three of 129 randomized and treated patients were discontinued prematurely from the studies as required by the safety monitoring plan for elevated LFTs. All three was receiving levoketoconazole and atorvastatin study therapies at the time of their adverse events. Among these three patients, LFTs returned to normal after study drug was discontinued. Three other patients had modest elevations in LFT levels that led to elective premature study withdrawal (i.e. not dictated by the safety monitoring plan). The LFT levels in these three patients also returned to normal after study drug was discontinued. 

 
  12

 
Four additional patients required close monitoring of LFTs following an observed LFT abnormality, per protocol, and had resolution of their LFT abnormalities while receiving study drug. A detailed analysis of the liver transaminase elevations in this study showed that there was no correlation between the dose of levoketoconazole and abnormal liver transaminases. A safety signal consistent with drug-induced QTc prolongation was also observed in one of the drug-drug interaction studies. 
 Owing to the known risks of liver injury and QTc prolongation with ketoconazole and the observed safety signals in the Phase 2 program in type 2 diabetes, suspected liver injury and QTc prolongation (including related cardiac adverse events) were pre-defined as adverse events of special interest (“AESIs”) in the Phase 3 Cushing’s syndrome studies. 

Clinical and Preclinical Development of Recorlev in Cushing’s Syndrome
 In the United States, Recorlev is considered a new molecular entity.  Upon completion of the clinical development program for Cushing’s Syndrome, we intend to file for marketing authorizations in the United States and elsewhere.  In the United States, an NDA, which is a prerequisite to marketing authorization, can be submitted under one of a number of approval paths defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  Following consultations with the FDA, we determined that the 505(b)(2) approval pathway, which permits an NDA applicant to rely on data from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, is the appropriate pathway for a Recorlev NDA.  Because a 505(b)(2) NDA approval can rely in part on data already accepted by the FDA or otherwise publicly available, an abbreviated and reduced development program may be possible.  In the case of Recorlev, we intend to rely in our NDA on published literature and the FDA’s prior findings concerning the safety and/or effectiveness of ketoconazole.  A similar marketing authorization path is available in most of the rest of the world, and we anticipate that the studies supporting U.S. approval will likewise support approvals to market Recorlev elsewhere, including in the European Union. The FDA has acknowledged that no additional preclinical investigations will be required for Recorlev prior to an NDA filing. The EMA’s CHMP has requested a study of reproductive toxicity that may be completed prior to filing for marketing authorization in Europe, pending further discussions.
 In August 2018, we announced top-line results from the pre-planned interim analysis of our multinational, pivotal Phase 3 SONICS study evaluating Recorlev for treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. The open-label, single-arm, maintenance-of-benefit SONICS study achieved statistical significance of its pre-specified primary endpoint, with 30 percent of patients achieving normalization of mean UFC following six months of maintenance treatment with Recorlev without a dose increase (one-sided p=.0154 vs. the null hypothesis of less than or equal to 20%). Sensitivity analyses as well as secondary and exploratory endpoints of UFC response were supportive of the primary endpoint.
 We have also initiated LOGICS, a second Phase 3 clinical trial of Recorlev for the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. The LOGICS study will supplement the long-term efficacy and safety data from the SONICS trial via a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal phase of approximately 8 weeks among 54 patients that follows an open-label titration and maintenance phase of approximately 14 weeks. Top-line data following the randomized-withdrawal phase of LOGICS are expected by the end of 2019. 
 We believe that if SONICS has (1) demonstrated consistent and significant clinical benefit by meeting the primary endpoint of the trial, specifically the responder rate measured as normalization of UFC levels at the 6-month time point without need for dose increase during the 6-month maintenance phase and (2) show consistent improvement of objectively quantifiable biomarkers of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome comorbidities, such as blood glucose, blood lipids, blood pressure or weight, and improvement of other clinical signs and symptoms of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome, then it would be regarded by regulators as adequate proof of efficacy in this rare disease with a high unmet medical need.  Therefore, we consider LOGICS as a mechanism for providing independent evidence of efficacy of Recorlev in a second, placebo controlled and blinded trial rather than serving as sole or primary evidence of efficacy for Recorlev in endogenous Cushing’s syndrome.  Furthermore, if successful, LOGICS has the potential to provide adequate evidence of efficacy durability beyond one year of therapy in the subset of patients who were previously enrolled in SONICS. Finally, we believe that the combination of SONICS and LOGICS will provide an adequate demonstration of the long-term safety and tolerability of Recorlev in patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome.  In total over 130 

 
  13

 
unique patients with this condition will have been treated with Recorlev during SONICS and LOGICS, and some patients will have been treated with Recorlev for at least 3 years at the time of first NDA submission.  
 In 2018, we initiated a long-term, open-label extension study with Recorlev (“OPTICS”) to capture longer-term safety, tolerability and efficacy data from patients who complete either SONICS or LOGICS and who choose to continue therapy with Recorlev. OPTICS will continue to accrue data for a minimum of three years, with a plan to allow patients to continue participating in the study until it has become available for purchase in their own country. We expect that we might be required by the FDA and the EMA to collect additional safety data post‑approval.
 Phase 3 Clinical Trials
 SONICS Phase 3 Clinical Trial
 We enrolled 94 patients in our SONICS Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States, Canada, the European Union and the Middle East. This clinical trial was conducted pursuant to a U.S. IND for Recorlev for the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome that took effect in May 2013. The last patient visit occurred in November 2018.
  Following a screening phase, SONICS has three distinct treatment phases. During the dose titration (DT) phase, patients start at 150 mg twice daily dosing (300 mg total daily dose) and titrate in 150 mg increments up to a maximum 600 mg twice daily dosing (1,200 mg total daily dose). Following the dose titration phase, once the therapeutic dose has been reached, patients enter the maintenance (“M”) phase, during which the dose is fixed and cannot be changed other than for safety reasons, including loss of efficacy. At the end of the six-month M phase, UFC levels are measured and the UFC responder rate, which is the primary endpoint of the clinical trial, is determined. Patients who have completed the M phase may enter the extended evaluation phase, which we expect will provide additional safety and efficacy data. Throughout the entire clinical trial, various measurements for safety and efficacy are taken.

· | The primary endpoint of the clinical trial is the proportion of patients with UFC response to Recorlev, defined as a reduction in mean 24‑hour UFC levels to levels that are equal to or less than the upper level of normal range following six months of treatment in the M phase without a dose increase (during the M phase).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Key secondary endpoints include the number of patients with at least a 50% decrease in UFC levels, changes in blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol and weight compared to baseline, effects on clinical signs and symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome, quality of life measures obtained from the Cushing’s syndrome quality of life questionnaire and the severity of depression obtained from the Beck’s Depression Inventory II.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The clinical trial is also designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of Recorlev in patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome.
 Below is a diagram of the SONICS clinical trial design:

 Several elements of the SONICS clinical trial design were informed by the clinical development pathway of currently approved drug therapies in the United States and the European Union. Additionally, we incorporated advice from the CHMP and FDA into the design of the clinical trial. The FDA recommended use of a concurrent control group in SONICS. However, SONICS utilizes an open‑label, single‑arm design because use of a placebo control in a long-term, parallel-arm monotherapy design was considered unethical or infeasible to enroll, depending on the specific country or clinical trial site under consideration. Studies lacking a concurrent control group are more likely to be subject to unanticipated variability in study results that can potentially lead to flawed conclusions because they do not allow for discrimination of patient outcomes. As a result, even if we achieve the clinical trial’s endpoints, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could view our study results as potentially biased. We have attempted to control for bias introduction in SONICS via the use of strict evidence of active disease at baseline based on objective measures, an objectively measured primary endpoint with repeated longitudinal assessments and implementation of a strict data restriction plan that severely limits exposure to efficacy data at the Sponsor.
 In August 2018, we announced top-line results from our SONICS study evaluating Recorlev for treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. Approximately 90 patients were planned to be enrolled, and 94 patients were actually enrolled. Of the 94 patients, 77 completed the DT phase and 61 completed the M phase. 
 The primary objective of normalized mean UFC (mUFC) without an increase in the therapeutic dose over the preceding six months was achieved among 30% of all enrolled patients at the final visit of the 6-month M phase. Statistical significance of the primary endpoint analyzed using the intent-to-treat population was achieved, having excluded an mUFC normalization rate at the 6-month time point of 20% or lower (1-sided p = 0.0154; 2‑sided p = 0.031. Sensitivity analyses and secondary and exploratory analyses of mUFC response were all supportive of and suggested greater efficacy of levoketoconazole than the primary endpoint analysis, indicative of a conservative primary analysis method.
 Evidence of clinical benefit from levoketoconazole was further demonstrated by improvements in several pre-defined, key secondary endpoints of cardiovascular risk (i.e. cardiometabolic comorbidities of CS) in the maintenance-completer study population including highly statistically significant (maintaining overall type 1 error at 5%) and clinically meaningful decreases from baseline in mean fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C, total and low-density lipoprotein‑cholesterol and body weight.
 Safety and tolerability findings throughout the DT and M phases indicate that levoketoconazole was generally well tolerated, with a discontinuation rate due to adverse events of 13% and no new safety signals observed relative to the prior experience with the drug in type 2 diabetes. Fourteen of 94 patients (15%) reported one or more serious adverse events (SAE), and in 4 patients an SAE was deemed drug-related by investigators (1 case of elevated liver function tests, 2 cases of prolonged QTc, and 1 case of adrenal insufficiency). One patient death not considered drug-related (colon cancer; preferred terms of adenocarcinoma of colon and metastases to liver), was reported during the M phase.
 Liver-related adverse events were considered AESIs in SONICS and are of particular interest in light of serious hepatotoxicity reported rarely among users of ketoconazole. Seven (7.4%) patients were reported as having an AESI related to the liver, and five of the seven discontinued study drug permanently at the time of the event; the other two resumed study drug after interruption, although one of the two later discontinued. Transaminases were measured routinely at least every other week during dose titration and at least monthly during the M phase. At the baseline visit, 96% of patients enrolled had alanine aminotransferase (ALT) within the normal reference range. During treatment ALT did not exceed 20x ULN in any patient, and no Hy’s Law cases were reported. Three (3.2%) patients were recorded with a post-baseline ALT value greater than 5x ULN and an additional seven (7.4%) of patients had at least 1 ALT value greater than 3x ULN at any time after baseline. Most ALT elevations occurred during dose titration, and all elevations over 3x ULN occurred by Month 2 of the M phase. The aspartate aminotransferase values measured in these cases moved in the same direction as ALT but were less elevated. No patient had a total bilirubin level >1.5x ULN at any time. There was no obvious dose relationship among the cases, and each case was fully reversible upon drug interruption/discontinuation without clinical sequelae. It is not yet known if such events are predictable within an individual, but routine monitoring effectively identified elevated transaminase cases when they were mild and usually asymptomatic.  

 
  15

 

 ECGs with centrally over-read QTc were monitored routinely during the study at the same intervals as LFT monitoring. Five (5.3%) patients were reported as having a QT/cardiac-related AESI; in every case the patient was asymptomatic. There were no discontinuations due to QTc prolongation. No arrhythmias were reported. In each case of prolonged QTc, study drug was resumed after temporary interruption. A total of nine (10%) patients had at least one QTc value representing an increase of more than 60 milliseconds from baseline, and two (2.1%) patients had a QTc interval above the pre-defined mandatory drug-interruption threshold of 500 milliseconds. Routine ECG monitoring effectively identified patients with QTc prolongation without any clinical sequelae. Therefore, we believe QTc prolongation safety issues can be appropriately managed with product labeling.  
 LOGICS Phase 3 Clinical Trial    Rather than alter the design of SONICS to facilitate regulatory authority requests for a concurrent control group with which to compare the efficacy and safety of Recorlev, we initiated LOGICS, a second Phase 3 pivotal study. LOGICS will include a concurrent comparison of Recorlev to matching placebo using a randomized, double-blind withdrawal design that we believe will be both feasible to enroll and ethical to conduct everywhere that SONICS is being conducted. LOGICS will randomize approximately 54 patients. 
 Following a screening phase, LOGICS has three distinct treatment phases for patients who did not participate in SONICS and two distinct phases for most of those who did participate in SONICS. The first phase, which is only intended for patients new to levoketoconazole or for those who require re-establishment of a therapeutic dose, is dose titration and maintenance.  During the dose titration and maintenance phase, patients start at 150 mg twice daily dosing (300 mg total daily dose) and titrate in 150 mg increments up to a maximum 600 mg twice daily dosing (1,200 mg total daily dose) and remain at their individualized therapeutic dose.  The total duration of this phase is up to 19 weeks.  SONICS-completers who are currently receiving a stable therapeutic dose skip dose titration and maintenance and proceed directly to the second phase, where they are joined by those who progressed through the first phase. The second phase is randomized-withdrawal, during which patients are randomly assigned to either continue active treatment with levoketoconazole or be switched to a matching placebo using the same tablet number. The primary efficacy endpoint comes at the end of the randomized-withdrawal period, which lasts no more than 9.5 weeks for each patient (and may end sooner if a “rescue” is needed). The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with a loss of established UFC response in the placebo group compared with the proportion in the levoketoconazole group. The final phase of LOGICS is the restoration phase, during which all patients once again receive active therapy; however, in order to conceal the therapy in the randomized-withdrawal phase, it was necessary to blind the therapy during restoration using twice the number of tablets (one active and one placebo). Throughout the entire clinical trial, various measurements for safety and efficacy are taken.

 Veldoreotide Modified-Release —a Novel Somatostatin Analogue
 Overview

In June 2015, we acquired veldoreotide, a novel multi‑receptor targeted SSA that was previously in Phase 2 development as an immediate-release formulation and has the potential as a next-generation somatostatin analog to provide a new and differentiated treatment option for patients with conditions amenable to somatostatin receptor activation, such as acromegaly. We acquired veldoreotide as part of our strategy to build our rare endocrine franchise. At the time of acquisition, veldoreotide was in Phase 2 clinical development as a treatment for acromegaly in its original, immediate-release formulation. Acromegaly is a rare endocrine disorder that most commonly results from a benign tumor of the pituitary gland, leading to excess production of growth hormone and IGF‑1. The treatment goal is the normalization of growth hormone and IGF‑1, which is the main cause of the detrimental clinical signs and symptoms of acromegaly.
 SSAs are peptides that are administered as deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injections, typically as long-acting formulations for monthly injections.  They are the most commonly used drug therapy for the treatment of acromegaly and work by binding to specific subtypes of SSTs that are expressed by the tumor. Binding of SSAs to these SSTs leads to the beneficial inhibition of growth hormone secretion but can also result in the unwanted inhibition of secretion of other endocrine hormones such as insulin and glucagon in the pancreas. Like other SSAs, veldoreotide is a peptide that we are developing for injection. In contrast to approved SSAs, veldoreotide activates a different subset of SSTs. Like the marketed SSAs, it binds and activates signaling via SST2 and SST5. However, in contrast to the approved SSAs, which primarily target one or the other of SST2 or SST5, veldoreotide binds and activates SST2 and SST5 approximately with equal potency. Veldoreotide also has a high affinity for SST4, a receptor believed to be important to modulating pain signals in the peripheral nervous system. Veldoreotide does not bind to SST3 or the mu-opiate receptor at pharmacological concentrations. In vitro data suggest that a higher proportion of human adenomas are a target for growth hormone inhibition by veldoreotide as compared to octreotide, which is referred to as a single receptor targeted SSA that binds and activates predominantly via SST2, potentially resulting in an increased responder rate. Nonclinical data indicate that postprandial insulin secretion and gallbladder motility are both less inhibited by veldoreotide as compared with octreotide. 
 Based on the differentiated activation pattern of veldoreotide upon binding to SST subtypes, we believe that veldoreotide may offer an improved efficacy and safety profile relative to existing drug therapies for acromegaly and other conditions that are modifiable through activation of somatostatin receptors. In the three clinical studies of immediate-release veldoreotide completed outside the United States in healthy volunteers veldoreotide was able to suppress stimulated growth hormone levels to a similar extent as octreotide, and, when compared with immediate-release subcutaneous octreotide, there was less blunting of insulin in response to a mixed meal or oral glucose load. In two studies of patients with acromegaly, veldoreotide caused a similar degree of suppression of elevated serum growth hormone as octreotide. Veldoreotide has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of acromegaly by the FDA and the EMA.
 We have formulated veldoreotide as a modified-release, long-acting product using PLGA microsphere technology. Preliminary nonclinical studies suggest that an injection volume suitable for subcutaneous administration may be feasible for once-weekly dosing in humans. Depending on the results of ongoing exploratory nonclinical studies, we may elect to pursue a development pathway for veldoreotide modified-release that includes a therapeutic use outside of acromegaly or endocrinology in general. Regardless of indication(s) to be pursued, further development will require preclinical safety (toxicology) studies as well as manufacturing scale-up before the newly formulated product can enter clinical testing. We anticipate that such preclinical studies, once begun, will take at least 18 months to complete. 
 Completed Clinical Trials
 Five clinical trials of veldoreotide have been performed to date: three in healthy male volunteers and two in patients with acromegaly, all of which employed an immediate-release, short‑acting formulation injected subcutaneously. At the time the clinical trials described below were conducted, veldoreotide was named DG3173. These 

 
  17

 
trials were conducted by Aspireo Pharmaceuticals Ltd., other than DG3173‑I‑001, which was conducted by Develogen AG.
 The Phase 1 clinical trials involved 122 healthy subjects and the Phase 2 clinical trial involved 28 patients with acromegaly. No SAEs were observed, and mostly mild adverse events typical for SSAs such as injection site reactions and gastrointestinal side effects were reported. There was no evidence that veldoreotide adversely affects the liver, kidneys or other organ systems, including the cardiovascular system. Data from the multiple ascending dose clinical trial in healthy subjects (Study I 002) showed inhibition of growth hormone comparable to octreotide, but no or less inhibition of insulin secretion and less effect on glucose levels. The single ascending dose trial in patients with acromegaly (Study II 01) and the continuous infusion study in patients with acromegaly (Study II 02) confirmed that veldoreotide also suppresses excessively produced growth hormone to a similar maximal extent as octreotide.
 We believe the preliminary clinical findings from these trials corroborate the profile of veldoreotide observed in nonclinical studies, which suggested inhibition of growth hormone secretion without detrimental effects on post‑meal insulin or glucose metabolism. These preliminary findings contrast favorably with the well‑described insulin and glucose perturbations caused by octreotide, lanreotide and pasireotide, and we intend to conduct additional clinical trials to evaluate the clinical profile of veldoreotide and possibly its differentiation from existing SSAs. We believe veldoreotide potentially could confer distinct therapeutic advantages relative to currently approved SSAs as a treatment for somatostatin-responsive conditions.

      Our Rare Neuromuscular Franchise
 In December 2016, we acquired the U.S. marketing rights to Keveyis (dichlorphenamide) from Taro Pharmaceuticals North America, Inc., a subsidiary of Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Keveyis is the first and only therapy approved in the United States to treat hyperkalemic, hypokalemic and related variants of PPP, a group of rare hereditary disorders that cause episodes of muscle weakness or paralysis.
 Overview of PPP and Keveyis
 PPP is a rare, genetic, neuromuscular disorder related to a defect in muscle ion channels with multiple variants and subtypes. The disease is characterized by episodes of muscle weakness and paralysis. It often interferes with daily activities and, as patients get older, it can lead to permanent muscle weakness. PPP may be localized (“focal”) or more widespread (“generalized”), and it often goes underdiagnosed and/or undertreated. Types of periodic paralysis are differentiated by criteria including underlying genetic mutations and changes in blood potassium during an episode. The two most common forms of PPP are hypokalemic, when episodes can be induced by low blood levels of potassium, and 

 
  19

 
hyperkalemic, when episodes are associated with elevated levels of blood potassium. We believe, based on our market research, that there are approximately 4,000 to 5,000 patients in the United States diagnosed with PPP.
 Keveyis is an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that was approved by the FDA in the United States in August 2015 to treat hyperkalemic, hypokalemic and related variants of PPP. The exact mechanism(s) through which oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and Keveyis in particular, decrease the frequency and severity of periodic paralysis attacks is unknown. However, it is believed that their effects are mediated both locally (i.e., in muscle) and systemically. It is not known whether their effects are disease-modifying. Keveyis has received orphan drug exclusivity status in the United States through August 7, 2022.
 Following FDA approval in August 2015, Keveyis was marketed by Taro. In May 2016, Taro announced the cessation of their commercial sales and related promotional activities for Keveyis. Taro supplied Keveyis to patients on a non-commercial basis through a single specialty pharmacy in the United States from May 2016 until our acquisition of the U.S. marketing rights to Keveyis in December 2016. We continued to supply Keveyis to patients on a non-commercial basis until launching Keveyis in April 2017. After acquiring the U.S. marketing rights for Keveyis, we established sales, marketing, market access and patient service capabilities.
 Because a large percentage of the people who suffer from PPP remain undiagnosed or inadequately treated, we developed programs to educate the medical community and patients about this illness. In addition, we established a field-based force of medical science liaisons. We use a single, specialty pharmacy to provide reimbursement, clinical and distribution support for Keveyis and to develop cost-sharing and patient assistance programs to support qualified, commercially insured patients, federal- and state-insured patients, and uninsured or under-insured patients. We also donate money to independent charitable foundations dedicated to this cause. Our ultimate goal is to ensure that no PPP patient is denied access to Keveyis for financial reasons. 
 Clinical Development of Keveyis
 The efficacy of KEVEYIS was evaluated in two clinical studies, Study 1 and Study 2. 
 Study 1
 Study 1 was a 9-week, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center study. Study 1 consisted of two substudies: a substudy in patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (n=44), and a substudy in patients with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (n=21). The primary efficacy endpoint in both substudies was the average number of self-reported attacks of muscle weakness per week over the final 8 weeks of the trial. Withdrawal from the study for acute severe worsening was also assessed as an endpoint. 
 In Study 1, the tested dose of Keveyis was 50 mg b.i.d. for treatment-naïve patients. Patients already receiving dichlorphenamide prior to the study continued on the same dose if randomized to Keveyis during the study. In patients taking acetazolamide prior to the study, the daily dose of Keveyis was set at 20% of the daily acetazolamide dose. Dose reduction for tolerability was permitted. 
 In the hypokalemic periodic paralysis substudy, median age of patients was 45 years and 73% of patients were male. Patients treated with Keveyis (n=24) had 2.2 fewer attacks per week than patients (n=20) treated with placebo (p=0.02). None of the patients randomized to Keveyis reached the endpoint of acute worsening, vs. five patients randomized to placebo. The mean dose of Keveyis at Week 9 was 94 mg/day. 
 In the hyperkalemic periodic paralysis substudy, median age of patients was 43 years and 43% of patients were male. During the double-blind treatment period, patients treated with Keveyis (n=12) had 3.9 fewer attacks per week than patients treated with placebo (n=9) (p=0.08). None of the patients randomized to Keveyis reached the endpoint of acute worsening, vs. two patients randomized to placebo. The mean dose of Keveyis at Week 9 was 82 mg/day.

 Study 2
 Study 2 was a 35-week, double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center, two-period crossover study. Study 2 also consisted of two substudies: a substudy in patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (n=42), and a substudy in patients with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (n=31), including patients with Paramyotonia Congenita (together termed potassium-sensitive periodic paralysis or PSPP). The primary endpoint in the hypokalemic periodic paralysis substudy was the incidence of acute intolerable worsening (based on attack frequency or severity) necessitating withdrawal. The primary endpoint in the hyperkalemic periodic paralysis substudy was the average number of self-reported attacks of muscle weakness per week. Dosing was determined similarly to Study 1. 
 In the hypokalemic periodic paralysis substudy, mean age of patients was 38 years and 79% of patients were male. Acute intolerable worsening was observed in 2 patients on Keveyis vs. 11 patients on placebo (p=0.02). The mean dose of Keveyis at the end of the study was 96 mg/day. 
 In the hyperkalemic periodic paralysis substudy, mean age of patients was 37 years and 58% of patients were male. Patients treated had 2.3 fewer attacks per week on Keveyis than on placebo (p=0.006). The mean dose of Keveyis at the end of the study was 73 mg/day.
 Commercialization Strategy 
 Our existing commercial infrastructure is limited. After acquiring the U.S. marketing rights for Keveyis in December 2016, we established sales, marketing, market access and patient service capabilities. We believe, based on our market research, that there are approximately 4,000 to 5,000 patients in the United States diagnosed with PPP and we believe that we can address the market by targeting physicians who are managing patients with PPP, including neuromuscular specialists, general neurologists and primary care physicians. 
 During 2018, we expanded our commercial infrastructure to support the product launch of Macrilen. In December 2018, we sold our subsidiary that help the U.S. and Canadian marketing rights to Macrilen to Novo. However, as noted elsewhere in this Annual Report, in connection with this transaction, we entered into a services agreement with Novo pursuant to which Novo will fund the costs of 23 of our field-based employees to provide full-time ongoing services to Novo, including the promotion of Macrilen in the United States, for a period of three years.
 Given the current stage of product development of our product candidates, we do not have a commercialization infrastructure for those product candidates, although we do plan to leverage our current commercial infrastructure when possible. As with Keveyis and Macrilen, we intend to independently commercialize our rare disease‑focused product candidates, if approved, in the United States, the European Union and other key global markets. We believe that we can address the markets of our current product candidates by targeting endocrinologists that are focused on the diagnosis and treatment of rare pituitary disorders primarily stemming from benign tumors. 
 Our commercial strategy for our product candidates, if approved, will encompass promoting their unique benefits, as well as a concerted effort to raise awareness about the underlying disease among the physician/patient community with the goal of increasing the rate of diagnosis when the symptoms may otherwise be overlooked. We believe the combination of our commercial efforts and our product candidate profiles will facilitate our ability to successfully penetrate our target markets.
 Manufacturing
 We do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and intend to continue to rely on third parties to produce Keveyis and our product candidates. 
 We have a supply agreement with Taro to produce Keveyis. We are obligated to purchase certain annual minimum amounts of product totaling approximately $29 million over a six-year period from Taro. The supply agreement may extend beyond the orphan exclusivity period unless terminated by either party pursuant to the terms of 

 
  21

 
the agreement. If the supply agreement is terminated by Taro at the conclusion of the orphan exclusivity period, we have the right to manufacture the product on our own or have the product manufactured by a third party on our behalf.
 The manufacturing, packaging and distribution of Recorlev drug product for clinical trials following Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMPs”), is currently outsourced under contracts to experienced contract manufacturers. We expect to enter into similar arrangements for veldoreotide.
 Intellectual Property of our Products and Product Candidates
 We actively seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, enforcing and defending patent rights for our products, product candidates and methods of treatment, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other protection (including exclusivity through orphan drug designation) for our products, product candidates and methods of treatment, preserve the confidentiality of any know‑how and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
 Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position generally by filing patent applications initially at the USPTO. After this initial phase, patent applications claiming priority to the initial application are filed in various countries, including the United States, Europe and Canada. In each case, we determine the strategy and territories required after discussion with our patent professionals with the goal of obtaining relevant coverage in territories that are commercially important to us and our product candidates. We will additionally rely on orphan drug designation exclusivity and patent term extensions when available. We also rely on trade secrets and know‑how relating to our underlying product technologies. Prior to making any decision on filing any patent application, we consider with our patent professionals whether patent protection is the most sensible strategy for protecting the invention concerned or whether the invention should be maintained as confidential.
 We own or license 55 granted patents, of which five are U.S. issued patents. We also own or license 15 pending patent applications, of which eight are U.S. patent applications. 
 We maintain trademark registrations and/or trademark applications for “Strongbridge Biopharma” and “Recorlev” in key geographies that include the United States, Australia, Brazil, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, Mexico, and Canada, among others. We also maintain trademark registrations and/or trademark applications for various additional potential trademarks for potential use if we determine not to utilize Recorlev as the branded pharmaceutical name for our levoketoconazole product candidate, once approved.
 Recorlev
 We own 45 issued patents related to our product candidate, Recorlev. Issued claims in these patents are directed to methods of treatment of various diseases or conditions associated with elevated cortisol levels or activity using Recorlev. The patents have been granted in major territories including the U.S., Europe, China and Japan and expire in 2026 and 2027. We have three pending U.S. patent applications directed to methods of treating a disease or condition associated with elevated cortisol levels or activity, including Cushing’s syndrome, with Recorlev. We also have an issued patent in the United States directed to reducing C-reactive protein levels and systemic inflammation through administration of a once-daily dose of Recorlev that expires in 2030. In addition to any patent exclusivity, we intend to rely on orphan drug designation exclusivity for Recorlev. Veldoreotide
 We own nine issued patents related to our product candidate, veldoreotide.  One of the patents is issued in the United States with claims covering an extended-release formulation and a method of manufacturing the formulation.  This patent expires in 2037.  We have filed eight patent applications that include substantially similar proposed claims in other countries including China, Japan, Canada and various countries in Europe.  In addition to any patent exclusivity, we intend to rely on orphan drug designation exclusivity for veldoreotide.

 
  22

 

 Keveyis
 We acquired U.S. marketing rights to Keveyis in late 2016.  We are not aware of any issued patents related to Keveyis. We have filed four patent applications in the United States related to Keveyis.  Although we intend to rely primarily on orphan drug designation exclusivity for Keveyis, we also expect to continue to prosecute such patent applications and explore additional life cycle management opportunities for Keveyis. Laws and Regulations Regarding Patent Terms
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non‑provisional application. In the United States, a patent term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in a patent prosecution by the patentee. A patent’s term may be lengthened by a patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent. The patent term of a European patent is 20 years from its effective filing date, which, unlike in the U.S., is not subject to patent term adjustments in the same way as U.S. patents.
 The term of a patent that covers an FDA‑approved drug or biologic may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch‑Waxman Act”) permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug or biologic is under regulatory review. Patent extensions cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug, for example Supplementary Protection Certificates. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We anticipate that some of our issued patents may be eligible for patent term extensions, but such extensions may not be available and, therefore, any commercial monopoly may be restricted.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, technology, and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products and new products that may become available in the future. Many of our competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have greater experience than we do in conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, and obtaining FDA, EMA and other regulatory approvals, and have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval for competing products more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory authority approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage, and our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Drugs resulting from our research and development efforts or from our joint efforts with collaboration partners therefore may not be commercially competitive with our competitors’ existing products or products under development.
 We are aware of several companies focused on developing or marketing therapies for rare neuromuscular and endocrine disorders. For our product candidates, the main competitors include:

· | Recorlev: A number of therapies are currently approved and in various stages of development for endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. Currently, there are no therapies broadly marketed for the treatment of
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  23

 

endogenous Cushing’s syndrome patients in the United States. Two therapies have limited indications in Cushing’s syndrome that is not due to adrenal carcinoma. Korlym (mifepristone) is a cortisol receptor blocker indicated to control hyperglycemia secondary to hypercortisolism in adult patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or are not candidates for surgery. Signifor (pasireotide) and Signifor LAR are marketed by Novartis in the United States and are indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Cushing's disease (a subset of Cushing’s syndrome) for whom pituitary surgery is not an option or has not been curative.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Ketoconazole, metyrapone and mitotane are marketed by HRA Pharma in certain European countries.  Osilodrostat (LCI699), an 11β-HSD2 inhibitor, is currently in Phase 3 clinical development by Novartis in Cushing’s disease.  Corcept Therapeutics is developing relacorilant (CORT125134), a selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, currently in Phase 3 for Cushing’s syndrome.  Millendo Therapeutics is developing nevanimibe hydrochloride (ATR-101), a selective acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT) inhibitor, currently in Phase 2.  Cedars-Sinai is developing seliciclib (R-roscovitine) for Cushing’s disease, in Phase 2.

· | Veldoreotide: A number of acromegaly therapies are currently approved and in various stages of development. There are currently three approved SSA therapies for acromegaly in the United States: Sandostatin LAR (octreotide) marketed by Novartis; Signifor LAR (pasireotide) marketed by Novartis; and Somatuline Depot (lanreotide) marketed by Ipsen. There is one growth hormone receptor antagonist, Somavert (pegvisomant), marketed by Pfizer. Chiasma had filed an NDA in the United States for RG-3806 (Mycapssa®), an oral octreotide formulation in 2015, and received a Complete Response Letter wherein FDA stated that it did not believe the company’s application had provided substantial evidence of efficacy to warrant approval, and advised Chiasma that it would need to conduct another clinical trial in order to overcome this deficiency. Additional therapies (owner) are in Phase 2 clinical development for acromegaly: CRN-00808 an oral SSA (Crinetics); IONIS-GHR-LRx, an antisense inhibitor of the GH receptor (Ionis); CAM‑2029, octreotide long‑acting (Camurus); ITF‑2984 (Italfarmaco); atesidorsen (ATL-1103), an antisense inhibitor of GH receptor (Antisense Therapeutics).

· | Keveyis: Acetazolamide, an oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is used frequently off-label for the prophylactic and sometimes acute treatment of PPP. Potassium supplements are indicated for use in hypokalemic periodic paralysis in the United States and are frequently used either chronically or for emergency treatment of episodes in that form of PPP. Several other types of drugs have been reported to have benefits for chronic or acute use in one or more than one PPP variant, including potassium-sparing diuretics, beta receptor agonists, mexelitine and other sodium channel blockers, and others. We are not aware of drugs currently in development for prophylactic chronic treatment of PPP. A Phase 2 clinical study of bumetanide, a loop diuretic, is underway in England for acute treatment of paralytic attacks.

  Government Regulation
 Product Approval Process
 The safety, clinical testing, manufacturing, quality, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regulates pharmaceutical products in the United States. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include:
· | the completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted under Good Laboratory Practices, (“GLPs”), and other applicable regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must be reviewed by the FDA and become effective before human clinical trials commence;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  24

 


· | the successful performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials conducted in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices (“cGCP”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | analysis of clinical trial data and preparation of submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------


· | the FDA’s acceptance of the NDA;
--+---------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is made to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of FDA inspections of clinical trial sites and GLP toxicology studies; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the FDA’s review and approval of an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain.
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of the product candidate, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may be commenced. The IND will become effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials as outlined in the IND prior to that time and places the IND on clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND, due to safety concerns or non‑compliance, and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidates to healthy volunteers or patients with the disease to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. Progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors must also report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, but the phases may overlap. These phases generally include the following:

· | Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials represent the initial introduction of a product candidate into human subjects, frequently healthy volunteers. In Phase 1, the product candidate is usually tested for safety, including adverse effects, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacodynamics. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to (1) evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific indications, (2) determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  25

 


· | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, and to provide sufficient data for the statistically valid evidence of safety and efficacy. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Phase 4 clinical trials are conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations, or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post‑market requirements or commitments. Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval.
 Clinical trials are inherently uncertain and any phase may not be successfully completed. A clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by the FDA, IRB or sponsor at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides ongoing oversight and safety reviews to determine whether or not a clinical trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the clinical trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Sponsors have the opportunity to meet with the FDA at certain points during the development of a new drug to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. These meetings may be held prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and/or before an NDA is submitted. Meetings may be requested at other times as well.
 The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information on the manufacture, composition and quality of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee payment. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application, for example if the NDA is not sufficiently complete, or decide that the data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan drug designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan drug designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non‑orphan indication(s).
 Once the NDA submission has been submitted, the FDA has 60 days after submission of the NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing. NDAs receive either a standard or priority review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA sets a goal date by which it plans to complete its review. For a standard review, this is typically 10 months from the date of submission of the NDA application. The review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facility complies with cGMPs and may also inspect clinical trial sites for integrity of data supporting safety and efficacy. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to risk, benefit and interpretation of clinical trial data. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but generally follows such recommendations in making its decisions. The FDA may delay approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and/or the FDA requires additional testing or information. The FDA may require post‑marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the NDA submission and may require substantial additional 

 
  26

 
clinical testing, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), clinical data, and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 The FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post‑market studies or clinical trials. Such post‑market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat an orphan disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as demonstrating clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user‑fee waivers. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug product designated as an orphan product receives regulatory approval for an indication broader than that for which it is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar but not identical benefits in that jurisdiction.
 Post‑Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product distribution, advertising and promotion, and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval and may require additional clinical trials and NDA submissions. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third‑party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. 

 
  27

 
Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained, or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post‑market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, but are not limited to:

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning letters or holds on post‑approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

  The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Moreover, the federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this new federal legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. Further, this legislation requires manufacturers to comply with detailed drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.
 Foreign Regulation
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Other Healthcare Laws
 In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws restrict certain business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, anti‑kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency statutes and regulations.

 
  28

 

 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, arranging for, ordering or recommending any good, facility, item or service for which payment is made, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or any other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our future practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for a statutory exception or safe harbor protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case‑by‑case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare program covered business, the statute has been violated. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), amended the intent requirement under the Anti‑Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes (discussed below) such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or the specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below). Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti‑kickback laws, and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our current and future sales and marketing practices and/or our future relationships with physicians might be challenged under these laws, which could cause harm to us.
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 The federal false claims laws prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non‑covered, uses.
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services.
 In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity.

HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, and newly empowered state attorneys general with the authority to enforce HIPAA. In January 2013, the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued the Final Omnibus Rule under HIPAA pursuant to HITECH that makes significant changes to the privacy, security, and breach notification requirements and penalties. The Final Omnibus Rule, which generally took effect in September 2013, enhances certain privacy and security protections, and strengthens the government’s ability to enforce HIPAA. The Final Omnibus Rule also enhanced requirements for both covered entities and business associates regarding notification of breaches of unsecured protected health information. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways. These state laws may not have the same effect and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Additionally, PPACA also included the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to comply with required reporting requirements could subject applicable manufacturers and others to substantial civil money penalties.
 Also, many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement a comprehensive compliance program that includes a limit or outright ban on expenditures for, or payments to, individual medical or health professionals and/or require pharmaceutical companies to track and report gifts and other payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers.
 Because we commercialize products that are reimbursed under federal and other governmental healthcare programs, we have developed a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and healthcare program requirements. Although compliance programs and adherence thereto may mitigate the risk of violation of and subsequent investigation and prosecution for violations of the above laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health care laws or regulations described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we are subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post‑marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 In both domestic and foreign markets, our sales depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third‑party payors. Third‑party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third‑party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our commercial products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of the products. Sales of these products therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of these products are paid by third‑party payors. These third‑party payors are increasingly focused on containing healthcare costs by challenging the price and examining the cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services.

 In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare product candidates. The market for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third‑party payors’ drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third‑party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third‑party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. Furthermore, third‑party payor reimbursement to providers for our product candidates may be subject to a bundled payment that also includes the procedure administering our products. To the extent there is no separate payment for our product candidates, there may be further uncertainty as to the adequacy of reimbursement amounts. Because each third‑party payor individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time consuming, costly and sometimes unpredictable process. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third‑party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost‑effectiveness and/or medical necessity of our products. This process could delay the market acceptance of any product and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost‑effective or medically necessary. Because coverage and reimbursement determinations are made on a payor‑by‑payor basis, obtaining acceptable coverage and reimbursement from one payor does not guarantee the Company will obtain similar acceptable coverage or reimbursement from another payor. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. If we are unable to obtain coverage of, and adequate reimbursement and payment levels for, our product candidates from third‑party payors, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition and future success.
 Furthermore, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control. In some non‑U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition for our product candidates from lower‑priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, there may be importation of foreign products that compete with our own products, which could negatively impact our profitability.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future business and operations if and when we begin to directly commercialize our products.
 In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state level that seek to reduce healthcare costs. Initiatives to reduce the federal deficit and to reform healthcare delivery are increasing cost‑containment efforts. We anticipate that Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and Medicare and Medicaid spending, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, price controls on pharmaceuticals and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. Any proposed or actual changes could limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability.
 In March 2010, PPACA was signed into law. PPACA has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. PPACA, among other things: established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated; 

 
  31

 
increased the statutory minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to offer 50% point‑of‑sale discounts on negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. For years the U.S. Congress has been assessing new legislation designed to repeal and replace core sections of the PPACA. On December 22, 2017, for instance, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”), which repealed the “individual mandate” of the PPACA. The repeal of the individual mandate is expected to cause millions fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise. The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the PPACA. In January 2017, the President signed an Executive Order directing applicable federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices.
 Members of the United States Congress and the Trump administration have expressed an intent to pass legislation or adopt executive orders to fundamentally change or repeal parts of the PPACA.
 Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by PPACA. These actions include directing applicable federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. On October 13, 2017, an Executive Order was signed terminating the cost sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the PPACA. Several state Attorneys Generals filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. Further, on June 14, 2018 the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12.0 billion in PPACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the PPACA marketplace, providers, and our business, are not yet known.
 Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under PPACA have been signed into law. On December 22, 2017, for instance, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”), which repealed the “individual mandate” of the PPACA. The repeal of the individual mandate is expected to cause millions fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise. Further, on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of PPACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of PPACA are invalid as well. While this judge, as well as the Trump Administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this judicial decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace PPACA will impact PPACA and our business.
 In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the PPACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” In July 2018, the CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain PPACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the PPACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. Moreover, CMS issued a final rule in 2018 that will give states 

 
  32

 
greater flexibility, starting in 2020, in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the PPACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation, designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump Administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. 
 At the state level, individual states in the United States are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we will be able to charge for our product candidates, or the amounts of reimbursement available for our product candidates. If future legislation were to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions, it could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Managed care organizations, as well as Medicaid and other government agencies, continue to seek price discounts. Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, measures to reduce costs of the Medicaid program, and some states are considering implementing measures that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid‑eligible. Due to the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the impact of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, payor or policy actions, which may include cost containment and healthcare reform measures. Such policy actions could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.
