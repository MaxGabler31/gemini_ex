ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Carbonite, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "Carbonite", the "Company", "our", "we", or "us") provides robust backup, disaster recovery, high availability and workload migration solutions (the "Carbonite Data Protection Platform"). The Carbonite Data Protection Platform supports businesses on a global scale with secure cloud infrastructure. 
We were incorporated on February 10, 2005 as a Delaware corporation and our principal executive offices are located at Two Avenue de Lafayette, Boston, Massachusetts, 02111. We founded Carbonite on one simple idea: all computers need to be backed up, and in our always-connected and highly mobile world, cloud backup is the ideal approach. 
We derive the majority of our revenue from subscription fees, and our consistently strong retention rates and scalable infrastructure help to support our growth. The remainder of our revenue is derived from software arrangements, which often contain multiple revenue elements, such as software licenses, hardware, professional services and post-contract customer support. We sell our solutions globally, and our customers primarily come from the following sources: through our website, our inside sales team, acquisitions, or from our network of channel partners, including distributors, value-added resellers, managed service providers, and global systems integrators. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we generated revenue of $296.4 million, $239.5 million, and $207.0 million, respectively. We continue to invest in customer acquisition because the market for our solutions is highly competitive and, as a result, our bookings have grown from $128.2 million in 2014 to $307.0 million in 2018. For a reconciliation of bookings to revenue for the last five years, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data.
We continue to invest in strategic acquisitions and integrate these acquisitions into our portfolio of technology solutions, in order to expand our addressable market and increase our strategic importance to customers.
On March 19, 2018, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Mozy Inc., a cloud backup service for consumers and businesses, and certain related business assets owned by EMC Corporation or its affiliates, for a purchase price of $144.6 million in cash, net of cash acquired. On February 7, 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Webroot Inc. ("Webroot"), a leading cybersecurity company, for 
1

$618.5 million in cash, which will be adjusted with respect to cash, debt, transaction expenses and working capital. We believe that these acquisitions strengthen our overall technology portfolio and position us as a leader in the endpoint and data protection markets.
Industry Trends
Trends on several fronts are fueling growth opportunities for Carbonite.
The first trend is the increase in IT complexity. The more data businesses generate, the harder it becomes to protect. According to analyst firm Enterprise Strategy Group ("ESG"), the top drivers of IT complexity are higher data volume (41%), increased number of endpoints (39%) and increased number of apps (35%).1 Businesses today seek solutions that protect data across all systems and IT environments, including across physical, virtual and cloud platforms. 
The need to optimize for data protection is also driving customers towards the cloud. Analyst firm Gartner predicts that by 2020, the number of enterprises using the cloud as a backup target will double, up from 10% at the beginning of 2017.2 Carbonite’s efficient cloud infrastructure fuels a variety of data protection models - from backup, to high availability to workload migration - in the right deployment models - from physical, to virtual, to cloud, to meet the needs of our customers.
The second trend is threats to data. The number of cyberattacks known as “ransomware” have grown rapidly in recent years. The FBI defines ransomware as a type of malware installed on a computer or server that encrypts the files, making them inaccessible until a specified ransom is paid.3 According to Cybersecurity Ventures, global ransomware damage costs are expected to hit $11.5 billion annually by the end of 2019.4 In order to avoid bad press and reputational damage, many ransomware incidents are not reported. We expect this trend to drive adoption of backup solutions as businesses and individuals look for solutions to protect their data to avoid falling prey to criminals.
Finally, the industry analyst firm Gartner estimates the Disaster Recovery as a Service ("DRaaS") market is expected to reach $3.7 billion by 2021.5 According to Gartner, mid-market drivers for DRaaS include improved affordability and functionality. We believe data growth and data threats will continue to drive the need for data protection and that our solutions position us well to capitalize on this growth opportunity.

CARBONITE is a registered trademark in the U.S. and in over numerous other countries, including countries in the European Union.
Encryption and data security: We use sophisticated encryption technology to ensure the privacy of our customers’ stored data. For solutions that utilize our cloud environments, we encrypt files using a secure key before the files leave the customers' computer and transmit the encrypted files over the internet to secure data centers. Customers’ files then remain encrypted on our servers to guard against unauthorized access. We employ outside security analysis firms, including anti-hacking specialists, to review and test our defenses and internal procedures.
Comprehensive customer support: We believe that our customer support is more comprehensive than that offered by our primary competitors in the cloud backup market and aids in our customer retention. Our award-winning customer support team is available via telephone, live chat, and email; all of which are included in our subscription fee.

Our proprietary technologies are fundamental to our value proposition, as they enable us to deliver solutions that are scalable, reliable and cost effective.
Marketing and Sales
Our marketing and sales programs are focused on three primary goals: acquiring customers at a low cost, retaining existing customers and building brand awareness. Our efforts to achieve these goals include the following:
Marketing. Our customers come from two primary sources: businesses who buy our solutions through our website, our inside sales team or from our network of partners, and consumers who sign up for solutions on our website in response to our direct marketing campaigns. We support our sales network with a marketing approach that leverages our established brand to drive market awareness and demand generation among the broad population of businesses and consumers. Our marketing efforts are designed to attract prospective customers and enroll them as paying customers, either through immediate sale, free trials or communication of the benefits of our solutions and development of ongoing relationships.
Channel distribution. To further penetrate the extensive and diverse population of businesses, we have and will continue to invest in our network of sales channel partners. Our network of sales channel partners includes distributors, value-added resellers, MSPs and global systems integrators and is designed to sell large volumes of our relatively low-priced solutions to customers.
Retention. Our retention efforts are focused on establishing and maintaining long-term relationships with our customers by delivering a compelling customer experience and superior value, communicating regularly with customers through email, on-site messaging and other media, and creating positive interactions with our customer support team. We monitor developing trends in subscription durations, renewals, and customer satisfaction to maximize our customer retention. We offer incentives to customers to purchase multi-year subscriptions, which we believe helps to increase our retention.
Intellectual Property
We believe the strength of our brand and the functionality of our software help differentiate us from our competitors. Our success therefore depends on our ability to protect our technologies and intellectual property, which allows us to move and store vast amounts of customer data. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions. We have numerous registered or pending applications for trademarks and other marks in the United States and worldwide. In addition, we have issued patents and pending applications in the United States and worldwide that cover both our technical infrastructure and our key usability and design concepts.

Competition
The data protection market in which we operate is rapidly evolving due to technological advances that are driving changes in the way our customers generate, store, protect, analyze, and leverage their critical business data. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of continued market consolidation, the introduction of new technologies and new market entrants. 
We compete against many companies across the data protection, disaster recovery, high availability and storage industries, ranging from those who provide a wide array of IT services, to those who provide only a specific business continuity product, to distributors and resellers. We expect many of our actual and potential competitors and solutions to change as we expand further into the business market and as the markets we compete in continue to evolve.
We believe that in order to successfully compete a company must provide comprehensive service offerings that are easy to install and use. These offerings must be supported by a strong brand reputation, be competitively priced and provide value in the form of cloud storage, data security, and reliability. We believe that Carbonite competes favorably with respect to each of these key factors by providing powerful, yet simple solutions. Our offerings are easy-to-use, affordable, secure, include a variety of storage capacity options, and enable anytime, anywhere access to data. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 959 full-time and 12 part-time employees. Of our full-time employees, 298 were in operations and support, 242 were in sales and marketing, 233 were in research and development, and 186 were in general and administrative functions. Employees in certain foreign jurisdictions are represented by collective bargaining agreements as may be customary or required in those jurisdictions.
Subsequent Events
On February 7, 2019, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger to acquire Webroot. We will acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Webroot, a leading cybersecurity company, for $618.5 million in cash, which will be adjusted with respect to cash, debt, transaction expenses and working capital. The consummation of the merger is subject to certain closing conditions (excluding a financing condition) and also includes customary termination provisions for both Webroot and the Company; including if the merger has not been consummated by May 8, 2019, which date is subject to extension in certain circumstances with respect to regulatory clearance. The merger agreement also contains representations, warranties, and covenants by the parties that are customary for a transaction of this nature. The acquisition is expected to be consummated in the first quarter of 2019.
Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, we entered into a financing commitment letter (the “Commitment Letter”) for (i) a seven-year senior secured term loan facility of $550.0 million (the “Term Loan Facility”) and (ii) a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility” and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Facilities”). Upon execution of the Revolving Facility, we intend to terminate our previously executed Revolving Credit Facility entered into on March 19, 2018. We will fund the transaction with existing cash and the proceeds of borrowings under the Facilities. The Facilities will be subject to certain customary representations, warranties and covenants. The funding of the Facilities is subject to our compliance with customary terms and conditions precedent as set forth in the Commitment Letter, including the execution and delivery of definitive documentation consistent with the Commitment Letter and the substantially simultaneous consummation of the merger on terms consistent with the merger agreement.
