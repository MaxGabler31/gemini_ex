ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Investors Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation which became the holding company for Investors Bank (“the Bank”) in May 2014, upon the completion of the mutual-to-stock conversion of Investors Bancorp, MHC. Prior to the 2014 conversion, Investors Bancorp, MHC held 55% of Investors Bancorp’s outstanding common stock in connection with its initial public offering in October 2005, which raised net proceeds of $509.7 million. The second step conversion was completed on May 7, 2014. The Company raised net proceeds of $2.15 billion by selling a total of 219,580,695 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share in the second step stock offering and issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock and a $10.0 million cash contribution to the Investors Charitable Foundation. Concurrent with the completion of the stock offering, each share of Investors Bancorp common stock owned by public stockholders (stockholders other than Investors Bancorp, MHC) was exchanged for 2.55 shares of Company common stock. At December 31, 2018, the Company had 359,070,852 common stock issued and 286,273,114 outstanding. 
The Company is subject to regulation as a bank holding company by the Federal Reserve Board. The Company neither owns nor leases any property, but instead uses the premises, equipment and furniture of the Bank. At the present time, the Company 
1

employs as officers only certain persons who are also officers of the Bank and uses the support staff of the Bank from time to time. These persons are not separately compensated by the Company. The Company may hire additional employees, as appropriate, to the extent it expands its business in the future.    
The Bank is a New Jersey-chartered savings bank headquartered in Short Hills, New Jersey. Originally founded in 1926 as a New Jersey-chartered mutual savings and loan association, it has grown through acquisitions and internal growth, including de novo branching. In 1992, the charter was converted to a mutual savings bank and in 1997 the charter was converted to a New Jersey-chartered stock savings bank.
The Bank is in the business of attracting deposits from the public through its branch network and by a secure online channel and borrowing funds in the wholesale markets to originate loans and to invest in securities. The Bank originates multi-family loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loans, one-to four- family residential mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, construction loans and consumer loans, the majority of which are home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and cash surrender value lending on life insurance contracts. Securities, primarily mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Government and Federal Agency obligations, and other securities represented 14.0% of consolidated assets at December 31, 2018. The Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (“NJDOBI”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).
Our Business Strategy 
Since the Company’s initial public offering in 2005, we have transitioned from a wholesale thrift business to a retail commercial bank. This transition has been primarily accomplished by increasing the amount of our commercial loans and core deposits (savings, checking and money market accounts). Our transformation can be attributed to a number of factors, including organic growth, de novo branch openings, bank and branch acquisitions, as well as product expansion. We believe the attractive markets we operate in, namely, New Jersey and the greater New York metropolitan area, will continue to provide us with growth opportunities. Our primary focus is to build and develop profitable customer relationships across all lines of business, both consumer and commercial.
Opportunities through Our Attractive Markets 
The markets in which we operate are considered attractive banking markets within the United States, and we believe they will continue to provide us with opportunities to grow. We have expanded our franchise to include the suburbs of Philadelphia and the boroughs of New York City as well as Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island. Additionally, we have strengthened our presence in our historic markets throughout New Jersey. We accomplished this expansion through de novo growth and select bank and branch acquisitions. As a result of this growth, the Bank is the largest bank headquartered in the state of New Jersey as measured by New Jersey deposits as of June 30, 2018. The markets in which we operate are desirable from an economic and demographic perspective as they are characterized by large and dense population centers, areas of high income households and centers of robust business and commercial activity. Our competition in these markets tends to be from out-of-state headquartered money centers and super-regional financial institutions as well as smaller, local community banks. We believe that as a locally headquartered institution, situated between these extremes, we can compete and capitalize on opportunities that exist in our market area. We continue to examine our branch network to optimize our market presence, which may include branch rationalization plans. 
Many of the counties we serve are projected to experience moderate to strong household income growth through 2024. Though slower population growth is projected for many of the counties we serve, it is important to note that these counties are densely populated. All of the counties we serve have a strong mature market and nearly all have median household incomes greater than the national median.
We face intense competition in making loans as well as attracting deposits in our market area. Our competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions and insurance companies. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms and mutual funds. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we currently do not offer, such as trust services and private banking. As of June 30, 2018, the latest date for which statistics are available, our market share of deposits was ranked in the top 10 of total deposits in the State of New Jersey and in the top 20 within the New York metropolitan area for all institutions.

Growing and Diversifying the Loan Portfolio
Our business plan has been, and will continue to be, to grow and diversify our loan portfolio. We have accomplished the majority of this growth by focusing on originating multi-family and commercial real estate loans in our market area through our New York City and New Jersey loan production offices. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we originated $1.58 billion in multi-family loans and $801.8 million in commercial real estate loans. We are focusing on growing our commercial loan portfolio because it helps to diversify the loan portfolio and reduces our interest rate exposure to mortgage-backed securities and one- to four-family mortgages. 
To further diversify our loan portfolio we have increased C&I lending by building relationships with small to medium sized companies in our market area. We have hired a number of experienced C&I lending teams, including a team specializing in the healthcare industry. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we originated $957.7 million in C&I loans. A significant portion of our C&I loans are secured by commercial real estate and are primarily on properties and businesses located in New Jersey and New York. We have diversified our loan portfolio, as evidenced by the fact that commercial loans (including commercial real estate, multi-family, C&I and construction loans) represent approximately 72% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2014, when commercial loans were approximately 59% of total loans. Growing and diversifying our loan portfolio will continue to be a major focus of our business strategy going forward, however, we are mindful of concentrations as it pertains to capital. 
Deposit Strategy 
We are focused on generating core deposits (savings, checking and money market accounts). As of December 31, 2018, we had core deposits of $13.01 billion, representing approximately 74% of total deposits, compared to December 31, 2014 when core deposits were $9.60 billion, representing 79% of total deposits. Although recent increases in interest rates has resulted in consumer preference for and growth in time deposits, we continue to focus on the growth of core deposits as they are an attractive funding alternative because they are generally a more stable source of low cost funding and are less sensitive to changes in market interest rates. Over the same time, the percent of non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits has grown from 10% to 14%. Despite intense competition for deposits, we will continue to pursue a relationship-based approach to solving our client’s financial needs and continue to invest in branch staff training, product development, de novo branch growth based on existing market presence, as well as commercial deposit gathering efforts. Over the past few years we have developed a suite of commercial deposit and cash management products, designed to appeal to small and mid-sized businesses and non-profit organizations including electronic deposit services such as remote deposit capture. Mobile and online banking services have also been developed to serve our customers’ needs and adapt to a changing environment. We will continue to enhance our digital capabilities as a way to stay connected to our customers.
Our deposit business has become more commercial oriented over the past few years as we attract more deposits from commercial entities, including most of the businesses that borrow from us. The Bank has become one of the largest depositories for government and municipal deposits in New Jersey, which provides us with an additional funding source. Our branch network, concentrated in markets with attractive demographics and a high density population, will continue to provide us with opportunities to grow and improve our deposit base.
Acquisitions 
A significant portion of our historic growth can be attributed to our acquisition strategy. Through 2014 we completed eight bank or branch acquisitions. Our acquisition of Gateway Community Financial Corp was completed in January 2014, with $254.7 million of deposits and 4 branches in Gloucester County, NJ and our acquisition of Roma Financial Corporation was completed in December 2013, with $1.34 billion of deposits and 26 branches in the Philadelphia suburbs of New Jersey. Although management evaluates a number of factors when considering an acquisition, we have maintained a fundamental focus on preserving tangible book value per share. Acquisitions have provided us with the opportunity to grow our business, expand our geographic footprint and improve our financial performance. We intend to continue to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities that may present themselves in the future while maintaining the financial and pricing discipline that we have adhered to in the past.
On February 2, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of a $345.8 million equipment finance portfolio. The acquisition included a seven-person team of financing professionals to lead the Company’s Equipment Finance Group, which is a part of the Company’s business lending group and is classified within our C&I loan portfolio. 
Capital Management
Capital management is a key component of our business strategy. We raised net proceeds of $2.15 billion in equity in May 2014 upon the completion of the second step mutual conversion. As of December 31, 2018, our tangible equity to asset ratio was 11.12%. Since our second step, we have managed our capital through a combination of organic growth, stock repurchases and dividends. In March 2015 we received approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to commence 
3

a 5% buyback program and announced our first share repurchase program. Subsequently we announced three additional repurchase programs each authorizing a 10% buyback program. Since receiving approval in March 2015 we have repurchased 87.8 million shares totaling $1.06 billion at an average price of $12.12. 
Beginning in September of 2012, we began to pay a quarterly cash dividend of $0.02 per share. Since then our quarterly dividend has increased to $0.11 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2018 our dividend payout ratio per share was approximately 53% which included a 22% dividend increase in the fourth quarter of 2018 to $0.11 per share. 
Involvement in Our Communities
The Bank proudly promotes a higher quality of life in the communities it serves in New Jersey and New York through employee volunteer efforts and our Charitable Foundations. Employees are continually encouraged to become leaders in their communities and use the Bank’s support to help others. Through the Investors Charitable Foundation, established in 2005, and the Roma Charitable Foundation, which we acquired in December 2013, the Bank has contributed or committed $33.9 million in donations to enrich the lives of New Jersey and New York citizens by supporting initiatives in the arts, education, youth development, affordable housing, and health and human services. 
Community involvement is one of the principal values of the Bank and provides our staff with a meaningful ability to help others. We believe these efforts contribute to creating a culture at the Bank that promotes high employee morale while enhancing the presence of the Bank in our local markets. We continue to look for opportunities to help the communities we serve and in 2018 participated in the State of New Jersey’s Neighborhood Revitalization Tax Credit Program with a $1.3 million charitable contribution. 
Lending Activities
Our loan portfolio is comprised of multi-family loans, commercial real estate loans, construction loans, C&I loans, residential mortgage loans and consumer and other loans. At December 31, 2018, multi-family loans totaled $8.17 billion, or 37.8% of our total loan portfolio, commercial real estate loans totaled $4.79 billion, or 22.1% of our total loan portfolio, C&I loans totaled $2.39 billion, or 11.1% of our total loan portfolio, and construction loans totaled $227.0 million, or 1.1% of our total loan portfolio. Residential mortgage loans represented $5.35 billion, or 24.8% of our total loans at December 31, 2018. We also offer consumer loans, which consist primarily of home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and cash surrender value lending on life insurance contracts. At December 31, 2018, consumer and other loans totaled $707.9 million, or 3.3% of our total loan portfolio.

Multi-family Loans. At December 31, 2018, $8.17 billion, or 37.8%, of our total loan portfolio was comprised of multi-family loans. Our policy generally has been to originate multi-family loans in New York, New Jersey and surrounding states.

Multi-family loans are generally five to fifteen year term balloon loans amortized over fifteen to thirty years. 
Commercial Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2018, $4.79 billion, or 22.1%, of our total loan portfolio was commercial real estate loans. We originate commercial real estate loans in New Jersey, New York and surrounding states, which are secured by industrial properties, retail buildings, office buildings and other commercial properties. Commercial real estate loans in our portfolio consist of both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans which were originated at prevailing market rates. Commercial real estate loans are generally five to fifteen year term balloon loans amortized over fifteen to thirty years.

Commercial and Industrial Loans. At December 31, 2018, $2.39 billion, or 11.1%, of our total loan portfolio were classified as C&I loans. We offer a wide range of credit facilities to C&I clients throughout our geographic footprint. Our credit offerings are lines of credit, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate term loans and letters of credit. A significant portion of our C&I loans are secured by commercial real estate and are primarily properties and businesses located in New Jersey and New York. Other collateral for these types of loans can be comprised of real estate, equipment and/or a lien on the general assets, including inventory and receivables of the underlying business, and in many cases are further supported by a personal guarantee of the owner. As the Company and our footprint have grown, we have broadened our product offerings to create certain C&I lending subspecialties, including expanded lending to the healthcare industry. Included in the Company’s C&I loans were $107.0 million of loans to cooperative housing corporations and groups (“Co-Op loans”). In February 2018, we completed the acquisition of a $345.8 million equipment finance portfolio, comprised of both loans and leases, which is classified within our C&I portfolio and are primarily secured by critical use assets. In connection with the acquisition, we launched an Equipment Finance Group within our C&I team. 
Construction Loans.  At December 31, 2018, we held $227.0 million in construction loans representing 1.1% of our total loan portfolio. We offer loans directly to owners and developers on income-producing properties and residential for-sale housing units. Generally, construction loans are structured to have a three-year term and are made in amounts of up to 70% of the appraised value of the completed property, or a maximum up to the cost of the improvements. Funds are disbursed based on inspections in accordance with a schedule reflecting the completion of portions of the project. Construction financing for units to be sold require a pre-sale contract or we will limit the amount of speculative building without a sales contract.
Residential Mortgage Loans.  At December 31, 2018, $5.35 billion, or 24.8%, of our loan portfolio consisted of residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans are originated by our mortgage subsidiary, Investors Home Mortgage, for our loan portfolio and for sale to third parties. We also purchase mortgage loans from correspondent entities including other banks and mortgage brokers. Our agreements call for these correspondent entities to originate loans that adhere to our underwriting standards. In most cases, we acquire the loans with servicing rights. 
We offer various loan programs to provide financing for low-and moderate-income home buyers, some of which include down payment assistance for home purchases. Through these programs, qualified individuals receive a reduced rate of interest on most of our loan programs and have their application fee refunded at closing, as well as other incentives if certain conditions are met.
Consumer and Other Loans. At December 31, 2018, consumer and other loans totaled $707.9 million, or 3.3% of our total loan portfolio. We offer consumer loans, most of which consist of home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and cash surrender value lending on life insurance contracts. Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit are secured by residences primarily located in New Jersey and New York. Home equity loans are offered with fixed rates of interest, with terms generally up to 20 years and to a maximum of $750,000. Home equity lines of credit have adjustable rates of interest, indexed to the prime rate. 
At December 31, 2018, cash surrender value loans totaled $344.6 million, or 49% of consumer and other loans. Acceptable credit history and FICO scores are reviewed along with the evaluation of the financial rating of the insurance carrier. 
Loan Originations and Purchases. The following table shows our loan originations, loan purchases and repayment activities with respect to our portfolio of loans receivable for the periods indicated.

Credit Policy and Procedures
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. The credit approval process provides for prompt and thorough underwriting and approval or decline of loan requests. The approval method used is a hierarchy of individual credit authorities for new credit requests and renewals. All credit actions require a total of two signatures, one from the Bank’s business line and one from the Bank’s credit risk management group. Transactions exceeding certain thresholds are submitted to the Bank’s Credit Approval Committee for decision. Our credit authority standards and limits are reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors. Approval limits are established on criteria such as the risk associated with each credit action, amount, and aggregate credit exposure of a borrower. The Bank’s Credit Risk Committee approves authorities for lending and credit personnel, which are ultimately submitted to our Board for ratification. Credit authorities are based on position, capability, and experience of the individuals. 
Loans to One Borrower. The Bank’s regulatory limit on total loans to any one borrower or attributed to any one borrower is 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. As of December 31, 2018, the regulatory lending limit was $434.5 million. The Bank’s internal policy limit is $150.0 million, with exceptions to this policy communicated to the Board of Directors. The Bank reviews these group exposures on a regular basis. The Bank also sets additional limits on size of loans by loan type. At December 31, 2018, there were two relationships with an individual borrower and its related entities that exceeded the internal limit totaling $184.6 million. Both were communicated to the Board of Directors and were performing in accordance with their contractual terms as of December 31, 2018. 
8

Asset Quality. One of the Bank’s key operating objectives has been, and continues to be, maintaining a high level of asset quality. The Bank maintains sound credit standards for new loan originations and purchases. We do not originate or purchase sub-prime loans, negative amortization loans or option ARM loans. Our portfolio contains interest-only and no income verification residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2018, interest-only residential and consumer loans represented less than 1% of the residential and consumer portfolio. From time to time and for competitive purposes, we originate interest-only commercial real estate and multi-family loans. As of December 31, 2018, these loans represented less than 10% of the total commercial loan portfolio. We maintain stricter underwriting criteria for these interest-only loans than for amortizing loans. We believe these criteria adequately control the potential exposure to such risks and that adequate provisions for loan losses are provided for all known and inherent risks.
The underlying credit quality of our loan portfolio is dependent primarily on each borrower’s continued ability to make required loan payments and, in the event a borrower is unable to do so, is dependent on the value of the collateral securing the loan, if any. A borrower’s ability to pay is typically dependent on employment and other sources of income in the case of one-to four-family mortgage loans and consumer loans. In the case of multi-family and commercial real estate loans, repayment is dependent on the cash flow generated by the property; in the case of C&I loans, on the cash flows generated by the business, which in turn is impacted by general economic conditions. Other factors, such as unanticipated expenditures or changes in the financial markets, may also impact a borrower’s ability to pay. Collateral values, particularly real estate values, may also be impacted by a variety of factors including general economic conditions, demographics, maintenance and collection or foreclosure delays.
Purchased Credit-Impaired Loans.  Purchased Credit-Impaired (“PCI”) loans are loans acquired at a discount, due in part to credit quality. PCI loans are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 310-30, “Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality”, and are initially recorded at fair value (as determined by the present value of expected future cash flows) with no valuation allowance (i.e., the allowance for loan losses). As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, PCI loans totaled $4.5 million and $8.3 million, respectively.

Non-Performing Assets. Non-performing assets include loans delinquent 90 days or more, non-accrual loans, performing troubled debt restructurings and real estate owned, and excludes PCI loans. Loans are classified as non-accrual when they are delinquent 90 days or more or if management has specific information that it is probable they will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. We did not have any loans delinquent 90 days or more and still accruing interest at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Non-accrual loans decreased by $10.8 million to $124.9 million at December 31, 2018 from $135.7 million at December 31, 2017. Included in the amount of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2018 were $7.1 million of commercial real estate loans and $4.2 million of C&I loans that were classified as non-accrual which were performing in accordance with their contractual terms. Included in the amount of non-accrual loans at December 31, 2017 were $13.9 million of multi family loans, $7.7 million of commercial real estate loans and $8.1 million of commercial and industrial loans that were classified as non-accrual which were performing in accordance with their contractual terms. During 2017, the Company sold $48.1 million of non-performing commercial real estate and multi-family loans from one relationship, resulting in no charge-offs. There were no sales of non-performing loans during 2018.
The ratio of non-accrual loans to total loans decreased to 0.58% at December 31, 2018 from 0.68% at December 31, 2017. Our ratio of non-performing assets to total assets decreased to 0.55% at December 31, 2018 from 0.61% at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non-accrual loans increased to 188.78% at December 31, 2018 from 170.17% at December 31, 2017. For further discussion of our non-performing assets and non-performing loans and the allowance for loan losses, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non-performing assets excluding PCI loans at the dates indicated.

At December 31, 2018, there were $47.8 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructured loans, of which $13.6 million were classified as accruing and $34.2 million were classified as non-accrual. For the year ended December 31, 2018, interest income that would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to $4.1 million. We recognized interest income of $1.6 million on such loans for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Other Real Estate Owned. Real estate we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned (“REO”) until sold. When property is acquired it is recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure less estimated costs to sell the property. Holding costs and declines in fair value result in charges to expense after acquisition. At December 31, 2018, we had REO of $6.9 million consisting of 30 residential properties and 3 commercial properties.
Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide that loans and other assets of lesser quality should be classified as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” assets. An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. An asset classified as “doubtful” has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable. An asset classified as “loss” is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance on the institution’s books as an asset without the establishment of a specific valuation allowance or charge-off is not warranted. We classify an asset as “special mention” if the asset has a potential weakness that warrants management’s close attention. While such assets are not impaired or classified assets, management has concluded that if the potential weakness in the asset is not addressed, the value of the asset may deteriorate, adversely affecting the repayment of the asset.
We are required to establish an allowance for loan losses in an amount that management considers prudent for loans classified substandard or doubtful, as well as for other problem loans. General allowances represent loss allowances, which have been established to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When we classify problem assets as “loss,” we are required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the NJDOBI and the FDIC, which can require that we establish additional general or specific loss allowances.
We review the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Not all classified assets constitute non-performing assets.
Impaired Loans. The Company defines an impaired loan as a loan for which it is probable, based on current information, that the lender will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The Company evaluates commercial loans with an outstanding balance greater than $1.0 million and on non-accrual status, loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”), and other commercial loans with an outstanding balance greater than $1.0 million if management has specific information that it is probable they will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement for impairment. Impaired loans are individually evaluated to determine that the loan’s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value 
11

of the collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows. Smaller balance homogeneous loans are evaluated for impairment collectively unless they are modified in a TDR. Such loans include residential mortgage loans, consumer loans, and loans not meeting the Company’s definition of impaired, and are specifically excluded from impaired loans. At December 31, 2018, loans meeting the Company’s definition of an impaired loan totaled $86.7 million. The allowance for loan losses related to loans classified as impaired at December 31, 2018, amounted to $2.2 million. Interest income received during the year ended December 31, 2018 on loans classified as impaired totaled $904,000. For further detail on our impaired loans, see Note 1 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.”
Allowance for Loan Losses
Our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level necessary to absorb loan losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management considers the losses inherent in our loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities, along with the general economic and real estate market conditions. A description of our methodology in establishing our allowance for loan losses is set forth in the section “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies — Allowance for Loan Losses.” The allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2018 is maintained at a level that represents management’s best estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio. However, this analysis process is inherently subjective, as it requires us to make estimates that may be susceptible to significant revisions based upon changes in economic and real estate market conditions. Although we believe we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels, additions may be necessary if the current economic environment deteriorates. 
As an integral part of their examination processes, the NJDOBI and the FDIC will periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.

Securities
The Board of Directors has adopted our Investment Policy. This policy determines the types of securities in which we may invest. The Investment Policy is reviewed annually by management and changes to the policy are recommended to and subject to approval by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors delegates operational responsibility for the implementation of the Investment Policy to the Asset Liability Committee, which is primarily comprised of senior officers. While general investment strategies are developed by the Asset Liability Committee, the execution of specific actions rests primarily with our Treasurer. The Treasurer is responsible for ensuring the guidelines and requirements included in the Investment Policy are followed and all securities are considered prudent for investment. Investment transactions are reviewed and ratified by the Board of Directors at their regularly scheduled meetings.
Our Investment Policy requires that investment transactions conform to Federal and New Jersey State investment regulations. Our investments purchased may include, but are not limited to, U.S. Treasury obligations, securities issued by various Federal Agencies, State and Municipal subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions, overnight and short-term loans to other banks, investment grade corporate debt instruments, and mutual funds. In addition, the Company may invest in equity securities subject to certain limitations.
The Investment Policy requires that securities transactions be conducted in a safe and sound manner. Purchase and sale decisions are based upon a thorough pre-purchase analysis of each instrument to determine if it conforms to our overall asset/liability management objectives. The analysis must consider its effect on our risk-based capital measurement, prospects for yield and/or appreciation and other risk factors.
In December 2013, regulatory agencies adopted a rule on the treatment of certain collateralized debt obligations backed by trust preferred securities to implement sections of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), known as the Volcker Rule. At December 31, 2018, none of our securities were deemed to be a covered fund under the Volcker Rule.
14

At December 31, 2018, our securities portfolio totaled $3.68 billion representing 14.0% of our total assets. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale when purchased. At December 31, 2018, $1.56 billion of our debt securities were classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost and $2.12 billion were classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value.
Mortgage-Backed Securities. We purchase mortgage-backed pass through and collateralized mortgage obligation (“CMO”) securities insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac (government-sponsored enterprises) and Ginnie Mae (government agency), and to a lesser extent, a variety of federal and state housing authorities (collectively referred to below as “agency-issued mortgage-backed securities”). At December 31, 2018, agency-issued mortgage-backed securities including CMOs, totaled $3.56 billion, or 96.7%, of our total securities portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company received proceeds of $632.4 million on the sale of lower yielding mortgage-backed securities from the available-for-sale portfolio resulting in gross realized losses of $32.8 million. Proceeds from the sale were reinvested in higher yielding mortgage-backed securities. 
Actual cash flows on mortgage-backed securities may differ from estimated cash flows over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments that can change the net yield on such securities. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities. The fair value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates and/or other market variables.
Our mortgage-backed securities portfolio had a weighted average yield of 2.25% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The estimated fair value of our mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2018 was $3.53 billion, which is $44.8 million less than the carrying value. The decrease to the fair value is attributed to an increase in interest rates during 2018.
We also may invest in securities issued by non-agency or private mortgage originators, provided those securities are rated AAA by nationally recognized rating agencies and satisfactorily pass an internal credit review at the time of purchase. Currently, the Company does not hold any non-agency mortgage-backed securities in its portfolio.
Corporate and Other Debt Securities. Our corporate and other debt securities portfolio primarily consists of collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”) backed by pooled trust preferred securities (“TruPS”), principally issued by banks and to a lesser extent insurance companies and real estate investment trusts. The interest rates on these securities are indexed to the 3-month LIBOR rate and reset quarterly. These securities have been classified in the held-to-maturity portfolio since their purchase. At December 31, 2018, corporate and other debt securities totaled $50.4 million, or 1.37%, of our total securities portfolio.
At December 31, 2018, the TruPS portfolio had a carrying value of $45.4 million, or 1.23% of our total securities portfolio, and a fair value of $82.0 million with none of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Throughout the year we engage an independent valuation firm to assist us in valuing our TruPS portfolio and the related other-than temporary impairment, or OTTI, analysis. At December 31, 2018, management deemed that the present value of projected cash flows for each security was greater than the book value and we did not recognize any OTTI charges for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company received proceeds of $7.3 million from the payoff and paydown of TruPS which resulted in $3.2 million of interest income from securities, as well as a gain of $1.2 million recognized as non-interest income. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company received proceeds of $3.1 million from the liquidation of one TruP security. As a result, $1.9 million was recognized as interest income from securities. There was no liquidation of TruPS for the year ended December 31, 2016.
We continue to closely monitor the performance of our CDO portfolio as well as the events surrounding this segment of the market. We will continue to evaluate for other-than-temporary impairment, which could result in a future non-cash charge to earnings.
Municipal Bonds.  At December 31, 2018, we had $25.5 million in municipal bonds which represents 0.69% of our total securities portfolio. These bonds are comprised of $21.5 million in short-term Bond Anticipation or Tax Anticipation notes and $4.0 million of longer term New Jersey Revenue Bonds. 
Government Sponsored Enterprises. At December 31, 2018, debt securities issued by Government Sponsored Enterprises held in our security portfolio totaled $41.3 million representing 1.12% of our total securities portfolio. 
Equity Securities. At December 31, 2018, we had $5.8 million in equity securities representing 0.16% of our total securities portfolio. Equity securities are not insured or guaranteed investments and are affected by market interest rates and stock market fluctuations. Such investments are carried at their fair value with fluctuations in the fair value of such investments, including temporary declines in value, reflected in the consolidated income statement.

Sources of Funds
General. Deposits are the primary source of funds used for our lending and investment activities. Our strategy is to increase core deposit growth to fund these activities. In addition, we use a significant amount of borrowings, primarily advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLB”), to supplement cash flow needs, to lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk management and to manage our cost of funds. Additional sources of funds include principal and interest payments from loans and securities, loan and security prepayments and maturities, repurchase agreements, brokered deposits, income on other earning assets and retained earnings. While cash flows from loans and securities payments can be relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition.
Deposits. At December 31, 2018, we held $17.58 billion in total deposits, representing 75.7% of our total liabilities. Although recent increases in market interest rates have resulted in consumer preference for and growth in time deposits, our long-term deposit strategy has been focused on attracting core deposits (savings, checking and money market accounts) as they represent a more stable source of low cost funds and may be less sensitive to changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2018, we held $13.01 billion in core deposits, representing 74.0% of total deposits, of which $311.0 million are brokered money market deposits. At December 31, 2018, $4.57 billion, or 26.0%, of our total deposit balances were certificates of deposit, which included $1.53 billion of brokered certificates of deposit. In addition, municipal deposits are a significant source of funds. At December 31, 2018, $4.28 billion, or 24.3%, of our total deposits consisted of public fund deposits from local New Jersey government entities. 
We have a suite of commercial deposit products, designed to appeal to small and mid-sized businesses and non-profit organizations. Interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties are all reviewed on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on our current operating strategies, market rates, liquidity requirements, competitive forces and growth goals. We also rely on personalized customer service, long-standing relationships with customers and an active marketing program to attract and retain deposits.
The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts we offer allows us to respond to changes in consumer demands and to be competitive in obtaining deposit funds. Our ability to attract and maintain deposits and the rates we pay on deposits will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. 
We intend to continue to invest in technology platforms and branch staff training, de novo branches, and to aggressively market and advertise our core deposit products and will attempt to generate our deposits from a diverse client group within our primary market area. We remain focused on attracting and maintaining deposits from consumers, businesses and municipalities which operate in our marketplace.

Enterprise Risk Management Framework
Our Board of Directors oversees our risk management process, including the bank-wide approach to risk management, carried out by our management. Our Board approves the strategic plans and the policies that set standards for the nature and level of risk we are willing to assume. The Board receives reports on the management of critical risks and the effectiveness of risk management systems. While our full Board maintains the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, its committees, including Audit, Risk Oversight and Compensation and Benefits committees, oversee risk in certain specified areas. The Risk Oversight Committee of the Board meets quarterly and provides independent oversight of all risk functions. Our Board has assigned responsibility to our Chief Risk Officer for maintaining the Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate risks in the execution of our strategic goals and objectives and ensure we operate in a safe and sound manner in accordance with the Board approved policies. 
During 2018, the Bank continued to enhance its risk management systems, policies and procedures adding staffing and expertise.  The Bank’s Management Risk Committee meets regularly and provides governance over risk policy and risk escalation. The ERM framework supports a culture that promotes proactive risk management by all Bank employees, a risk appetite framework with defined risk tolerance limits, and risk governance with a three lines of defense model to manage and oversee risk. In a three lines of defense structure, each line of business and corporate function serves as the first line of defense and has responsibility for identifying, assessing, managing and mitigating risks in their areas. Independent Risk Management serves as the second line of defense and is responsible for providing guidance, oversight and appropriate challenge to the first line of defense. Internal Audit serves as the third line of defense and ensures that appropriate risk management controls, processes and systems are in place and functioning effectively. 
Our ERM framework is consistent with common industry practices and regulatory guidance and is appropriate to our size, growth trajectory and the complexity of our business activities. The ERM Framework encompasses the following categories of risks; credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, price risk, operational risk, model risk, supplier risk, fraud risk, information security including cybersecurity, compliance risk, strategic risk, and reputational risk.
Personnel
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,903 full-time employees and 59 part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

Supervision and Regulation
The Bank is a New Jersey-chartered savings bank, and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC under the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Commissioner of the NJDOBI (the “Commissioner”) as the issuer of its charter, and, as a non-member state chartered savings bank, by the FDIC as the deposit insurer and its primary federal regulator. The Bank must file reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, and it must obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions and opening or acquiring branch offices. The Commissioner and the FDIC each conduct periodic examinations to assess the Bank’s compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the DIF and its depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes.
As a bank holding company controlling the Bank, the Company is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), and the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA and to the provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948 (the “New Jersey Banking Act”) and the regulations of the Commissioner under the New Jersey Banking Act applicable to bank holding companies. 
The regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks is intended to protect depositors, the DIF, and the U.S. banking system as a whole. This system is not designed to protect equity investors in bank holding companies. The Company is required to file reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of, the Federal Reserve Board, the Commissioner and the FDIC. The Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner conduct periodic examinations to assess the Company’s compliance with various regulatory requirements. The Company files certain reports with, and otherwise complies with, the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws and the listing requirements of NASDAQ.
Our business is heavily regulated by both state and federal agencies. Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of supervision to which our business is subject have increased in recent years, in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place. In addition, on May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “EGRRCP Act”) was enacted. This legislation includes targeted amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act and other financial services laws. While we currently anticipate that this legislation may result in regulatory and supervisory frameworks that are more tailored to our risk profile and asset size, such a result generally depends on future action by the U.S. banking agencies and, as a result, cannot be predicted with any certainty. The Company expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.
Stress Tests
Prior to the enactment of the EGRRCP Act, the Dodd-Frank Act required banks with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion to conduct annual stress tests. The Dodd-Frank Act also required the FDIC, in coordination with federal financial regulatory agencies, to issue regulations establishing methodologies for stress testing that provide for at least three different sets of conditions, including baseline, adverse, and severely adverse. The regulations also required banks to publish a summary of the results of the stress tests. The EGRRCP Act has eliminated the annual mandated stress test requirement for banks like us with total consolidated assets of less than $100 billion.
The Bank submitted its stress tests results by July 31, 2017, as required, and published updated stress test results on October 25, 2017. The stress testing results affirmed the adequacy of the Bank’s capital, even under severe economic conditions. While we are no longer required to conduct annual stress tests, we have advised our regulators that we will continue to conduct stress testing of our loan portfolio and advise our Board of Directors and our regulators of the results of such testing.
Volcker Rule
Under the provisions of the Volcker Rule we are prohibited from: (i) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for our own account; and (ii) having certain ownership interest in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds. The fundamental prohibitions of the Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of any size, including the Company and the Bank. The final Volcker Rule regulations impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities. The Company has put in place the compliance programs required by the Volcker Rule and has also implemented a governance and control program to ensure appropriate oversight and ongoing compliance. The U.S. banking agencies have indicated that they are evaluating certain revisions to the Volcker Rule which may affect its applications to banks based upon asset size and other factors. It is too early to assess whether there will be any major change in the scope or applicability of the Volcker Rule.
22

Consumer Protection and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Supervision
The Dodd-Frank Act also established the CFPB. The CFPB has rulemaking authority over all banks, and its examination and enforcement authority applies to banks at or greater than $10 billion in total assets. The Bank is subject to CFPB supervision and examination of compliance with Federal Consumer Protection Laws. In addition, this agency is responsible for interpreting and enforcing a broad range of consumer protection laws (“Federal Consumer Protection Laws”) that govern the provision of deposit accounts and the making of loans, including the regulation of mortgage lending and servicing. This includes laws such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 
The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and for state attorneys general to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the CFPB. In addition, while the CFPB is under new leadership, it is too early to assess whether this will result in any major change to the supervision or enforcement focus of the CFPB. The Company expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulations and supervision by the CFPB as well as applicable state consumer protection laws and regulations, which will continue to increase our operating and compliance costs.
New Jersey Banking Regulation
Activity Powers. The Bank derives its lending, investment and other powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and its related regulations. Under these laws and regulations, savings banks, including the Bank, generally may invest in:

• | real estate mortgages;


• | consumer and commercial loans;


• | specific types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies;


• | certain types of corporate equity securities; and


• | certain other assets.

A savings bank may also make investments pursuant to a “leeway” power, which permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act, subject to certain restrictions imposed by the FDIC. “Leeway” investments must comply with a number of limitations on the individual and aggregate amounts of “leeway” investments. A savings bank may also exercise trust powers upon approval of the Commissioner. Lastly, New Jersey savings banks may exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national banks or out-of-state banks or for federal or out-of-state savings banks or savings associations, provided that before exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege, prior approval by the Commissioner by regulation or by specific authorization is required. The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers are limited by federal law and the related regulations. See “Federal Banking Regulation — Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks” below.
Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitations. With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey-chartered savings bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower or to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15% of the bank’s capital funds. A savings bank may lend an additional 10% of the bank’s capital funds if secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act. The Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations.
Dividends. Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a stock savings bank may declare and pay a dividend on its capital stock only to the extent that the payment of the dividend would not impair the capital stock of the savings bank. In addition, a stock savings bank may not pay a dividend unless the savings bank would, after the payment of the dividend, have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock, or alternatively, the payment of the dividend would not reduce the surplus. Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the Bank. See “— Federal Banking Regulation — Prompt Corrective Action” below.
Minimum Capital Requirements. Regulations of the Commissioner impose on New Jersey-chartered depository institutions, including the Bank, minimum capital requirements similar to those imposed on insured state banks. See “— Federal Banking Regulation — Capital Requirements” below.
Examination and Enforcement. The NJDOBI may examine the Bank whenever it deems an examination advisable. The NJDOBI engages in routine annual examinations of the Bank. The Commissioner may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice, and may direct any director, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Commissioner has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Commissioner why such person should not be removed. The Commissioner may also seek the appointment of receiver or conservator for a New Jersey saving bank under certain conditions.

Federal Banking Regulation
Capital Requirements.  In July 2013, the FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revised their leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Final Capital Rules also revised the quantity and quality of required minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements, consistent with the Reform Act and the Third Basel Accord adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, or Basel III capital standards. In doing so, the Final Capital Rules:

• | Established a new minimum Common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (common equity tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets) of 4.5% and increased the minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio from 4.0% to 6.0%, while maintaining the minimum Total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% and the minimum Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 4.0%.


• | Revised the rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance their risk sensitivity.


• | Phased out trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock as Tier 1 capital.


• | Added a requirement to maintain a minimum Conservation Buffer, composed of Common equity tier 1 capital, of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, to be applied to the new Common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the Total risk-based capital ratio, which means that banking organizations, on a fully phased in basis no later than January 1, 2019, must maintain a minimum Common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0%, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5% and a minimum Total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5% or have restrictions imposed on capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments.


• | Changed the definitions of capital categories for insured depository institutions for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 prompt corrective action provisions. Under these revised definitions, to be considered well-capitalized, an insured depository institution must have a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5.0%, a Common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0% and a Total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%. 

The new minimum regulatory capital ratios and changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets became effective for the Bank and Company on January 1, 2015. The required minimum Conservation Buffer commenced on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and increased in annual increments to 1.875% on January 1, 2018. The Conservation Buffer completed its phase in by increasing to 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The rules impose restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary cash bonus payments if the minimum Conservation Buffer is not met. As of December 31, 2018 the Company and the Bank met the currently applicable Conservation Buffer of 1.875%.
In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. 
The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have also adopted regulations to require an assessment of an institution’s exposure to declines in the economic value of a bank’s capital due to changes in interest rates when assessing the bank’s capital adequacy. Under such a risk assessment, examiners evaluate a bank’s capital for interest rate risk on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors. Institutions with significant interest rate risk may be required to hold additional capital. According to the agencies, applicable considerations include:

• | the quality of the bank’s interest rate risk management process;


• | the overall financial condition of the bank; and


• | the level of other risks at the bank for which capital is needed.

As of December 31, 2018, the Bank and the Company were considered “well capitalized” under applicable regulations and exceeded all regulatory capital requirements as follows:

 | As of December 31, 2018 (1)

Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks. Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC.
Before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC to make such investment or engage in such activity. The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance funds. Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a “financial subsidiary” are subject to additional restrictions.
Federal law permits a state-chartered savings bank to engage, through financial subsidiaries, in any activity in which a national bank may engage through a financial subsidiary and on substantially the same terms and conditions. In general, the law permits a national bank that is well-capitalized and well-managed to conduct, through a financial subsidiary, any activity permitted for a financial holding company other than insurance underwriting, insurance investments or real estate development or merchant banking. The total assets of all such financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of the bank’s total assets or $50 billion. The bank must have policies and procedures to assess the financial subsidiary’s risk and protect the bank from such risk and potential liability, must not consolidate the financial subsidiary’s assets with the bank’s and must exclude from its own assets and equity all equity investments, including retained earnings, in the financial subsidiary. State-chartered savings banks may retain subsidiaries in existence as of March 11, 2000 and may engage in activities that are not authorized under federal law. Although the Bank meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries, it has not chosen to engage in such activities.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which consists of the regional Federal Home Loan Banks, each subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”). The Federal Home Loan Banks provide a credit facility for member institutions. It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Banks make loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures, including collateral requirements, established by the respective Boards of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Banks. These policies and procedures are subject to the regulation and oversight of the FHFA. All long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. The FHFA has also established standards of community or investment service that members must meet to maintain access to such long-term advances.
Safety and Soundness Standards. Pursuant to the requirements of FDICIA, as amended by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, each federal banking agency, including the FDIC, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to matters such as internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan 
25

documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal stockholder.
In addition, the FDIC adopted regulations to require a savings bank that is given notice by the FDIC that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan to the FDIC. If, after being so notified, a savings bank fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the FDIC may issue an order directing corrective and other actions of the types to which a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of FDICIA. If a savings bank fails to comply with such an order, the FDIC may seek to enforce such an order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil monetary penalties.
Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including the Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and to unsafe or unsound practices.
Prompt Corrective Action. Federal law establishes a prompt corrective action framework to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The FDIC has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. Those regulations were amended effective January 1, 2015 to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective on the same date. An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. 
Generally a receiver or conservator must be appointed for an institution that is “critically “undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date a savings bank receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly “undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Various restrictions, such as restrictions on capital distributions and growth, also apply to “undercapitalized” institutions. The FDIC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.
The Bank was classified as “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework as of December 31, 2018.
Liquidity. The Bank maintains sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation, in accordance with FDIC regulations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.” 
Deposit Insurance. The Bank is a member of the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC, up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor. 
The FDIC imposes an assessment for deposit insurance against all insured depository institutions. Each institution’s assessment is based on the perceived risk to the insurance fund of the institution, with institutions deemed riskiest paying higher assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base assessments on average total assets less tangible capital, rather than deposits. The FDIC’s assessment schedule ranges from 1.5 basis points to 40 basis points of average total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC has a more comprehensive approach to evaluating, for assessment purposes, the risk presented by larger institutions such as the Bank. Large institutions (i.e., $10 billion or more in assets) such as the Bank are subject to assessment based upon a detailed scorecard approach involving (i) a performance score determined using forward-looking risk measures, including certain stress testing, and (ii) a loss severity score, which is designed to measure, based on modeling, potential loss to the FDIC insurance fund if the institution failed.  The total score is converted to an assessment rate, subject to certain adjustments. In addition, effective as of July 1, 2016 the FDIC implemented a requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act that institutions with assets of $10 billion or more be responsible for increasing the DIF reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. On September 30, 2018, the DIF reached 1.36%, ahead of the September 30, 2020 deadline required under the Dodd-Frank Act. FDIC regulations provide that surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more will cease upon 
26

DIF reserve ratio reaching the statutorily required minimum. Assessments on large banks for periods subsequent to September 30, 2018 will no longer include a quarterly surcharge.
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We are not currently aware of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO began to mature in 2017 and continue to mature through 2019. For the fourth quarter of 2018, the annualized Financing Corporation assessment was equal to 0.32 basis points of total average assets less tangible capital.
Transactions with Affiliates of Investors Bank. Transactions between an insured bank, such as the Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and implementing regulations. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. Generally, a subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution or financial subsidiary is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B.
Section 23A:

• | limits the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such bank’s capital and surplus, as defined in the applicable regulations. Such transactions with all affiliates are limited to an amount equal to 20% of such capital and surplus; and 


• | requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.

The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions. Further, most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100% to 130% of the loan amounts. In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate.
Pursuant to Federal Reserve Board Regulation O, we are also subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their related interests. In general, such extensions of credit (i) may not exceed certain dollar limitations, (ii) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and (iii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Certain extensions of credit also require the approval of our Board of Directors.
Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Banks are subject to the prohibitions of 12 U.S.C. Section 1972 on certain tying arrangements. A depository institution is prohibited, subject to specific exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
Privacy Standards. FDIC regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares “non-public personal information,” to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter.
The Bank is also required to provide its customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having the Bank share their non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties before it can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions.
In addition, in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Bank must provide its customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having the Bank share their non-public personal information for marketing purposes with an affiliate or subsidiary before it can disclose such information.
The FDIC and other federal banking agencies adopted guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. The guidelines describe the agencies’ expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, which includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer.

Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All FDIC-insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income individuals and neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of a state chartered savings bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution’s record of compliance with the CRA. Among other things, the current CRA regulations rates an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs. In particular, the current evaluation system focuses on three tests:

• | a lending test, to evaluate the institution’s record of making loans in its service areas;


• | an investment test, to evaluate the institution’s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and/or census tracts and businesses; and


• | a service test, to evaluate the institution’s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices.

An institution’s failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities. The Bank received a “satisfactory” CRA rating in our most recent publicly-available federal evaluation, which was conducted by the FDIC in October 2017.
In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
In April 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury issued a memorandum to the Federal banking regulators with recommended changes to the CRA’s implementing regulations to reduce their complexity and associated burden on banks. The U.S. banking agencies are in the process of soliciting “ideas for building a new framework to transform or modernize the regulations that implement the CRA,” without proposing any specific revisions to present CRA requirements. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the CRA.
Loans to a Bank’s Insiders
Federal Regulation. A bank’s loans to its insiders — executive officers, directors, principal shareholders (any owner of 10% or more of its stock) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such persons (an insider’s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations. Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider’s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to the Bank. All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders’ related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank’s capital and surplus. With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer’s children and certain loans secured by the officer’s residence, may not exceed the lesser of (1) $100,000 or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 2.5% of the bank’s capital and surplus. Federal regulation also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider’s related interests, would exceed either (1) $500,000 or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus.
Generally, loans to insiders must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons. An exception is made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank.
In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a bank’s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
Extensions of credit to a savings bank’s executive officers are subject to specific limits based on the type of loans involved. Generally, loans are limited to $100,000, except for a mortgage loan secured by the officer’s primary residence and education loans for the officer’s children.
New Jersey Regulation. The New Jersey Banking Act imposes conditions and limitations on loans and extensions of credit to directors and executive officers of a savings bank and to corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons, which are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under federal law, as discussed above. The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a savings bank that is in compliance with federal law is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act.

Federal Reserve System
Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, the Bank is required to maintain reserves against its transaction accounts. The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves of 3% must be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts over $16.3 million and up to $124.2 million, and 10% against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of up to $124.2 million. The first $16.3 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements. The Bank is in compliance with these requirements. These requirements are adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board. Required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash and/or an interest bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank; or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve Board.
Anti-Money Laundering and Customer Identification
The Bank is subject to FDIC regulations implementing the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act. The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering (“AML”) requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act contains measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory and law enforcement agencies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act.
Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act and the related FDIC regulations require the:

• | Establishment of AML compliance programs that includes policies, procedures, and internal controls; the appointment of an AML compliance officer; an effective training program; and independent testing;


• | Making of certain reports to FinCEN and law enforcement that are designated to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing activities;


• | Establishment of a program specifying procedures for obtaining and maintaining certain records from customers seeking to open new accounts, including verifying the identity of customers within a reasonable period of time;


• | Establishment of enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money-laundering, terrorist financing and other suspicious activity;


• | Monitoring account activity for suspicious transactions; and


• | Impose a heightened level of review for certain high risk customers or accounts.

The USA PATRIOT Act also includes prohibitions on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and requires compliance with record keeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks. Bank regulators are directed to consider a holding company’s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on Federal Reserve Act and Bank Merger Act applications.
The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of the BSA and AML programs maintained by financial institutions. Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory orders may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements. In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies must consider the effectiveness of financial institutions engaging in a merger transaction in combating money laundering activities. The Bank has adopted policies and procedures to comply with these requirements. 
On August 12, 2016, the Bank agreed to enter into an informal agreement (“Informal Agreement”) with the FDIC and the NJDOBI with regard to BSA and AML compliance matters. The Bank agreed to; 1) develop, adopt and implement a system of internal controls designed to ensure full compliance with BSA; 2) conduct a comprehensive validation of the Bank’s BSA/AML automated compliance system; and 3) develop, adopt and implement effective training programs relating to BSA. The Bank also agreed to review certain transactions and accounts for BSA and AML compliance and to establish a Compliance Committee of the Board. The Bank continues to strengthen and enhance its BSA and AML compliance practices, policies, procedures and controls. In December 2018, the FDIC and the NJDOBI informed the Bank that the informal agreement had been terminated.

Holding Company Regulation
Federal Regulation. Bank holding companies, including the Company, are subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. Federal Reserve Board regulations impose consolidated capital adequacy requirements on bank holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. 
In addition, Federal Reserve Board guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with Federal Reserve Board staff in advance of issuing a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should inform the Federal Reserve Board and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if (i) net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (ii) prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. 
A bank holding company is required to provide the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, would be equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. Such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that is as “well capitalized” under applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, that has received a composite “1” or “2” rating, as well as a “satisfactory” rating for management, at its most recent bank holding company examination by the Federal Reserve Board, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues. However, it has recently come to the attention of the Company that the Federal Reserve Board staff is interpreting the capital regulations as requiring a bank holding company to secure Federal Reserve Board approval prior to redeeming or repurchasing any capital stock that is included in regulatory capital.
As a bank holding company, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval is also required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company.
In addition, a bank holding company that does not elect to be a financial holding company under federal regulations is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking are:

• | making or servicing loans;


• | performing certain data processing services;


• | providing discount brokerage services; or acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor;


• | leasing personal or real property;


• | making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and


• | acquiring a savings and loan association.

A bank holding company that elects to be a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incident to activities which are financial in nature. The Company has not elected to be a financial holding company, although it may seek to do so in the future. A bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company if:

• | each of its depository institution subsidiaries is “well capitalized”;


• | each of its depository institution subsidiaries is “well managed”;


• | each of its depository institution subsidiaries has at least a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating at its most recent examination; and


• | the bank holding company has filed a certification with the Federal Reserve Board stating that it elects to become a financial holding company.

Under federal law, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution, or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution 
30

in danger of default. This law would potentially be applicable to the Company if it ever acquired as a separate subsidiary a depository institution in addition to the Bank.
The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended by Section 613 of the Dodd-Frank Act, regulates interstate banking activities by establishing a framework for nationwide interstate banking and branching. As amended, this interstate banking and branching authority generally permits a bank in one state to establish a de novo branch at a location in another host state if state banks chartered in such host state would also be permitted to establish a branch at that location in the state. Under these amendments, the Bank is permitted to establish branch offices in other states in addition to its existing New Jersey and New York branch offices.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 eliminated most of the barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial companies previously imposed under federal banking laws if certain criteria are satisfied. Certain subsidiaries of well-capitalized and well-managed banks may be treated as “financial subsidiaries,” which are generally permitted to engage in activities that are financial in nature, including securities underwriting, dealing, and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be closely related to banking.
New Jersey Regulation. Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a company owning or controlling a savings bank is regulated as a bank holding company. The New Jersey Banking Act defines the terms “company” and “bank holding company” as such terms are defined under the BHCA. Each bank holding company controlling a New Jersey-chartered bank or savings bank must file certain reports with the Commissioner and is subject to examination by the Commissioner.
Acquisition of Investors Bancorp, Inc. Under federal law and under the New Jersey Banking Act, no person may acquire control of the Company or the Bank without first obtaining approval of such acquisition of control by the Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner. 
Federal Securities Laws. The Company’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The Company’s common stock held by persons who are affiliates (generally officers, directors and principal stockholders) of the Company may not be resold without registration or unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. If the Company meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of the Company is able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted to address, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information.
As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. We have existing policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations.
Taxation
Federal Taxation 
General. The Company and its subsidiary are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The Company and its subsidiary file a consolidated federal income tax return. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) was enacted. The new legislation reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and will impact the manner in which the Company is taxed going forward. The Company’s federal tax returns are not currently under audit. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company or its subsidiary.
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal and state income tax returns. 
31

Bad Debt Reserves. Historically, the Bank was subject to special provisions in the tax law regarding allowable bad debt tax deductions and related reserves. Tax law changes were enacted in 1996 pursuant to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”), which eliminated the use of the percentage of taxable income method for tax years after 1995 and required recapture into taxable income over a six-year period of all bad debt reserves accumulated after 1987. The Bank has fully recaptured its post-1987 reserve balance. Currently, the Bank uses the specific charge off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes. 
Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 (pre-base year reserves) were subject to recapture into taxable income if the Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests. As a result of the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves accumulated after 1987 are required to be recaptured into income over a six-year period. However, all pre-base year reserves are subject to recapture if the Bank makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its stock, pays dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits, or ceases to maintain a bank charter. At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s total federal pre-base year reserve was approximately $45.2 million. 
Alternative Minimum Tax. The Tax Act repealed the alternative minimum tax on corporations for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.
Net Operating Loss Carryovers. A corporation may carry forward net operating losses arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 indefinitely, subject to a deduction limitation of 80% of taxable income in a given year. However, net operating losses arising in tax years on or before December 31, 2017 are not subject to the 80% limitation deduction. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of $5.6 million related to prior acquisitions, arising in tax years prior to December 31, 2017. 
Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction. The Company may exclude from its federal taxable income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a wholly owned subsidiary. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 65% when the dividend is received from a corporation having at least 20% of its stock owned by the recipient corporation. A 50% dividends-received deduction is available for dividends received from a corporation having less than 20% of its stock owned by the recipient corporation.
State Taxation 
New Jersey State Taxation. The Company and its subsidiary file separate New Jersey corporate business tax returns on an unconsolidated basis. Generally, the income of corporations and savings institutions in New Jersey, which is calculated based on federal taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, is subject to New Jersey tax. On July 1, 2018, Assembly Bill 4202 was signed into law, providing significant revisions to New Jersey’s Corporation Business Tax laws. Among the changes provided for in the new legislation is a surtax, an additional imposition of tax, on corporate taxpayers that have allocated New Jersey net income in excess of $1 million. For tax years 2018 and 2019, the surtax is imposed at a rate of 2.5%; and for tax years 2020 and 2021, the surtax rate is 1.5%.
For 2018, the Company is required to file a standalone New Jersey income tax return. The Company meets the requirements to elect to be taxed as a New Jersey Investment Company, which allows it to be taxed at a rate of 3.6% compared to the 9% New Jersey statutory corporate rate. 
New Jersey tax law has not allowed for a taxpayer to file a tax return on a combined or consolidated basis with another member of the affiliated group where there is common ownership. On July 1, 2018, Assembly Bill 4202 was signed into law, mandating combined reporting for tax years ending on or after July 31, 2019.
In connection with the Company’s second step conversion, a $20.0 million charitable contribution was made to the Investors Charitable Foundation, $10.0 million of which was made by the Bank and the remaining $10.0 million by the Company. For the Company, the excess contribution over the allowable deduction limit for the standalone entity may be carried forward to the succeeding 5 taxable years. Based on the entity’s standalone future state taxable income, a valuation allowance was established for the portion of the state tax benefit related to the contribution that is not more likely than not to be realized. At December 31, 2018, the Company’s valuation allowance pertaining to the charitable contribution was reversed due to the enactment of New Jersey tax reform within the reporting period, which allows for charitable contributions at the Company standalone entity level to be subtracted from the combined group’s entire net income in future years, thus resulting in the projection of full utilization of the charitable deductions.
New York State Taxation. The New York State corporate franchise tax is based on the combined entire net income of the Company and its affiliates allocable and apportionable to New York State and taxed at a rate of 6.5%. The amount of revenues that are sourced to New York State under the new legislation can be expected to fluctuate over time. In addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (“MTA”) Surcharge allocable to business activities carried on in the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District. The MTA surcharge for 2018 was 28.6% of a recomputed New York 
32

State franchise tax, calculated using a 6.5% tax rate on allocated and apportioned entire net income. The Bank is currently under audit with respect to its New York State combined franchise tax return for tax years 2013 and 2014. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted. Since the starting point for computing entire net income, the primary base of the New York general corporation franchise tax, is federal taxable income, the federal concepts of income and deductions which apply for New York franchise tax purposes, subject to statutory additions, subtractions and modifications, continue to apply in the same manner as prior to the enactment of the new legislation.
New York City Taxation. The Company and its affiliates are subject to the combined corporate tax for New York City calculated on a similar basis as the New York State franchise tax, subject to the New York City apportionment rules. While the majority of the Company’s entire net income is derived from outside of the New York City jurisdiction, the sourcing rules enacted by the 2015 tax law provisions have increased the income apportioned to New York City and in turn, caused an increase to our effective tax rate. 
Pennsylvania Taxation. Considered a mutual thrift institution conducting business in Pennsylvania, the Bank is subject to the mutual thrift institutions tax. The mutual thrift institutions tax is imposed at the rate of 11.5% on apportionable net taxable income and is required to be reported and filed on the annual Net Income Tax Report. Mutual thrift institutions are exempt from all other Pennsylvania corporate taxes.
Delaware State Taxation. As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Company is exempted from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file annual returns and pay annual fees and an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware.
Other State Taxation. On February 2, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of a $345.8 million equipment finance portfolio, comprised of both loans and leases secured by various equipment including, but not limited to, trucks, railcars and container vessels, domiciled across numerous states. The Company’s filing obligations with respect to the equipment finance portfolio vary from state to state and depend upon the reporting requirements in the various jurisdictions.
