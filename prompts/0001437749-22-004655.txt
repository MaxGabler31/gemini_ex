ITEM 1.    Business
Overview 
 Boyd Gaming Corporation (the "Company," the "Registrant," "Boyd Gaming," "we" or "us") is a multi-jurisdictional gaming company that has been in operation since 1975. Headquartered in Las Vegas, we operate 28 wholly owned gaming entertainment properties in Nevada, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Through our strategic partnership with and as a 5% equity owner of FanDuel Group, the nation’s leading sports-betting and iGaming operator, we are also pursuing sports-betting and online gaming opportunities across the United States. At December 31, 2021, there were 11 FanDuel-branded sportsbooks operating within our properties, and FanDuel operated online sports-betting in partnership with us in three states. In addition, we operate Stardust-branded iGaming casinos in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In January 2022, we opened FanDuel-branded sportsbooks at two additional properties and FanDuel commenced operations of an online sportsbook in an additional state.
 
We continually work to position our Company for greater success by strengthening our existing operations and growing through acquisitions, capital investments and other strategic initiatives. As our properties reopened following the COVID-19 closures in mid-2020, we implemented a strategic shift in our operating philosophy to increase our focus on building loyalty with core customers and adopted a more efficient approach to doing business. This new operating model is focused on maximizing gaming revenues, streamlining our cost structure, targeting our marketing investments and reducing lower margin offerings, which allows us to flow a higher percentage of our revenues to the bottom line.
 
In addition, we believe the following factors have contributed to our success in the past and are central to our success in the future:
 

• | we have an experienced management team; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | our operations are geographically diversified within the United States; 
• | our Las Vegas Locals properties are well-positioned to capitalize on the attractive Las Vegas locals market; 
• | three of our properties are located in the growing downtown Las Vegas market and also market to a unique niche - Hawaiian customers;
• | we have used our increased free cash flow to strengthen our balance sheet; and 
• | we have the ability to expand certain existing properties and to act opportunistically to make strategic acquisitions. 

Properties 
 As of December 31, 2021, we own and operate 28 properties offering a total of 1,694,482 square feet of casino space, 31,635 slot machines, 686 table games and 10,751 hotel rooms. We derive the majority of our revenues from our gaming operations, which generated approximately 80% and 81% of our revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Food & beverage revenues, room revenues and other revenues each contributed less than 10% of revenues in each of 2021 and 2020.
 
We view each operating property as an operating segment. For financial reporting purposes, we aggregate our properties into three reportable business segments: (i) Las Vegas Locals; (ii) Downtown Las Vegas; and (iii) Midwest & South.
 
For financial information related to our segments as of and for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, see Note 13, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements presented in Part II, Item 8.

We have strong, informal relationships with Hawaiian travel agencies and offer affordable all-inclusive packages.

Competition
 Our properties generally operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against other gaming companies as well as other hospitality, entertainment and leisure companies. We face significant competition in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such competition may intensify in some of these jurisdictions if new gaming operations open in these markets or existing competitors expand their operations. Our properties compete directly with other gaming properties in each state in which we operate, as well as in adjacent states. We also compete for customers with other casino operators in other markets, including Native American casinos, and other forms of gaming, such as lotteries and internet gaming. In some instances, particularly with Native American casinos, our competitors pay substantially lower taxes or no taxes at all. We believe that increased legalized gaming in other states, particularly in areas close to our existing gaming properties and the development or expansion of Native American gaming in or near the states in which we operate, could create additional competition for us and could adversely affect our operations or future development projects.

During its initial phase, the BoydPay digital wallet is linked to a player's B Connected card and used to play or cash out on slot titles, also in partnership with Aristocrat. Pending regulatory approvals, we anticipate deploying this product at all of our casino properties nationwide.
 
During future phases, and pending regulatory approval, we will utilize Aristocrat technology to link the BoydPay wallet to our B Connected Mobile app, creating a contactless experience that will allow customers to use their smartphones to play and cash out on casino games and pay for amenities throughout the property.

Other Development Opportunities
 Development and Management Agreements with Wilton Rancheria
 We have separate development and management agreements with Wilton Rancheria, a federally-recognized Native American tribe, to develop and manage a gaming entertainment complex, located southeast of Sacramento, California. With all the necessary approvals in place and financing obtained, construction of Wilton's Sky River Casino began in first quarter 2021, and it is expected to open in fourth quarter 2022. 
Frequent Player Loyalty Programs
 B Connected 
 We have established a nationwide branding initiative and loyalty program. Our players use their "B Connected" cards to earn and redeem points at nearly all of our properties. The program has five player tiers - Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Onyx and Titanium. The "B Connected" club, among other benefits, rewards players for their loyalty and allows players to qualify for promotions and earn rewards toward slot, video poker, or table games play.
 
Benefits for our loyal customers include annual cruises, vacations, and gifts of luxury jewelry and electronics. The B Connected program is currently available at all properties except for Eastside Cannery and Jokers Wild.
 
Other Promotional Activities
 We provide other promotional offers and discounts targeted towards new customers, frequent customers, inactive customers, customers of various levels of play, and prospective customers who have not yet visited our properties, and mid-week and other promotional activities that seek to generate visits to our properties during slower periods. Complementaries are usually in the form of monetary discounts, and other rewards generally can only be redeemed at our restaurants, retail and spa facilities.
Government Regulation
 We are subject to extensive regulation under laws, rules and supervisory procedures primarily in the jurisdictions where our facilities are located or docked. The states in which we operate empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and may require access to periodic reports respecting those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A detailed description of the governmental gaming regulations to which we are subject is filed as Exhibit 99.1 and is herein incorporated by reference.
 
If additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate, such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. From time to time, various proposals have been introduced in the legislatures of some of the jurisdictions in which we have existing or planned operations that, if enacted, could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and us. We do not know whether or not such legislation will be enacted. The federal government has also previously considered a federal tax on casino revenues and the elimination of betting on National Collegiate Athletic Association events. With the recent expansion of sports wagering in various state jurisdictions, the federal government may elect to enact legislation taxing and regulating sports wagering, or alternatively may elect to prohibit such wagering. In addition, gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. Any material increase in these taxes or fees could adversely affect us.

Human Capital and Labor Relations 
 As of December 31, 2021, we have 15,114 Team Members, including 14,406 Team Members at our properties and 708 Team Members in our corporate function. We operate in ten states, and we have collective bargaining agreements with three unions covering 1,058 employees.
 
Our Team Members are the most important contributors to our business. For our business to operate successfully, to execute on our long-term strategy, and to continue to grow, we depend upon having Team Members with the necessary talent and skills to support our property operations and corporate function. 
 
Our access to talent is impacted by local factors in each of our communities, including employment levels, and demand for and availability of specialized skills. In the near term, we expect hiring pressures to be a challenge for our business, however we are confident that we will be able to maintain our workforce and add Team Members with the specialized skills and experience necessary to sustain and grow our business.
 
We strive to attract individuals who are people-focused and share the values of our culture, which we refer to as "Boyd Style." Our Culture includes valuing relationships, exceeding expectations, working smart, and exhibiting our commitment to integrity in everything we do. These values are expected and reinforced at all levels of our organization. We believe this fosters dignity and respect between our Team Members and creates a positive working environment, reinforces the customer experience, and promotes long-term stakeholder value.
 
We have programs dedicated to selecting new talent and enhancing the skills of our Team Members, including recruiting relationships with numerous industry associations, government agencies and colleges. We provide competitive wages and benefits to attract and retain the talent necessary for the successful operation of our business. Our benefits include healthcare and retirement benefits, holiday and paid time off, and tuition assistance. Additionally, the Company paid out over $10 million in team member appreciation bonuses in 2021 and recently announced a pathway to $15 per hour for all non-tipped, non-represented positions over the next 18 months.
 
We believe our business is differentiated from our competitors due to our commitment to customer service and delivering a customer experience that fosters long-term loyalty. As such, our business depends on the capability and friendliness of each of our Team Members in order to provide outstanding customer service to each of our guests. Every Team Member at Boyd Gaming is required to complete the Company’s guest service training program. The program is strongly linked to our culture and values and gives Team Members the tools and training to create outstanding customer service experiences for our guests. Additionally, all Boyd Gaming leaders are required to attend leadership training. The program provides our leaders with the tools and training to effectively communicate and coach their team to success.
 
We are committed to the diversity, equity and inclusion of our workforce. Currently, 51% of our workforce are women and 52% are minority Team Members. As a Company, we work hard to promote and increase the diversity of our workforce. Our goal is to attract, retain and grow individuals that reflect the diversity of the communities where we do business, to develop policies and practices that help our Team Members realize their potential, and to create goodwill with our Team Members and customers. Additionally, through our most recent annual Team Member Opinion Survey, 87% of Team Members reported high levels of satisfaction in regard to being treated with respect regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, age or any other aspect of team member identity.
 
The Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct that promotes ethical behavior and encourages Team Members to talk to supervisors, managers, or other appropriate personnel when in doubt about the best course of action. Furthermore, we also maintain a confidential Team Member hotline operated by an independent firm for anonymously reporting suspected wrongdoing.
 
Boyd Gaming strives to provide all Team Members a work environment free of discrimination and harassment. All supervisors and management staff are required to attend annual harassment awareness training and are responsible for ensuring that all Team Members comply with this policy and that appropriate action is taken if harassment occurs in the workplace.
 
We seek feedback from our Team Members through an annual Team Member Opinion Survey to measure the performance of our culture and to improve our work environment for Team Members. The annual survey regularly achieves over 80% participation. In our most recent survey, 78% of Team Members reported high levels of job satisfaction. Additionally, we have formal, annual goal setting and performance review processes to drive engagement, performance and retention. Our commitments to Team Member engagement are evidenced by our high average tenure of 9.5 years.
