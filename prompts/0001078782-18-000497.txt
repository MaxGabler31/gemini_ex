Item 1. BUSINESS
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on January 23, 2004. In May 2011, Paul Tidwell became Chairman and President and introduced our business plan of researching the location of and salvaging sunken ships. The Company is currently actively considering and negotiating several projects that have been extensively researched by its President. Several trips, including to Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, have been taken or have been scheduled. 
 
On November 21, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to assist a company in Singapore to recover a large shipment of tin from a sunken ship that is believed to be in the waters between Indonesia and Malaysia. An investor and minority shareholder provided the $200,000 needed by the Company to participate in this contract. The planning and preparation phase of the project, including the ship inspection procedures and engaging a crew, is underway so that the actual salvage effort can start in April 2018. 
 
The parties of the agreement have also agreed to use a portion of the proceeds for a $600,000 project to recover another cargo believed to have sunk off the coast of the Philippines.
 
No assurances can be given that the sunken ship will be found and, if found, will have the amount of recoverable tin that the parties to the contract are seeking.
 
The other projects being discussed and reviewed include:
 


The right to undertake an exploration to find the Flor de la Mar, a Portuguese ship that sank in 1511 with a rumored large cargo of treasures.



The right to participate in the salvage of the contents of the Flor de la Mar.



The right to sell or auction all or a portion of the contents salvaged from the Flor de la Mar.



A program to salvage/recover shipwreck artifacts at various sites throughout Panay Island, Philippines.



A program to salvage a Japanese submarine sunk during World War ll.

The contract/project discussions are being undertaken with a variety of people and entities, including Government officials outside the United States. Before any contract can be completed, the parties have to negotiate how the proceeds of any salvaged assets would be distributed. The likely outcome of these projects and discussions cannot be predicted at this time.

Competition
 
There are a number of other entities that seek to salvage sunken vessels. These firms generally have greater resources than do we. We believe that our competitive advantage comes from the extensive research done over a long period of time by our President. This research gives us strong indications as to the specific location and possible contents of targeted sunken vessels. It also provides knowledge as to the likelihood of claims by Governments, insurance companies and others with respect to any contents that are recovered.

We cannot predict whether the competitive advantages that we believe exist will result in success of our operations.

Intellectual Property 
 
We have no patents or trademarks. 

Employees
 
As of April 30, 2018, we had one employee, Paul Tidwell, our President, who devotes fulltime to us. Our president oversees all responsibilities in the areas of business plan development and execution. We do not have any other employees at this time. We plan on using subcontractors and independent consultants to work with us on all projects that we undertake.
