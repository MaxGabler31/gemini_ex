Item 1. Business
Overview
 Zevia PBC ("Zevia PBC") was incorporated as a Delaware public benefit corporation on March 23, 2021, and prior to the consummation of the reorganization described herein and our initial public offering (“IPO”), did not conduct any activities other than those incidental to our formation and the IPO. In connection with the completion of the IPO on July 26, 2021, Zevia PBC became a holding company, and its sole material asset is a controlling equity interest in Zevia LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Zevia LLC”). As the sole managing member of Zevia LLC, Zevia PBC operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Zevia LLC and, through Zevia LLC, conducts its business. Subsequent to July 26, 2021, Zevia PBC consolidates the results of Zevia LLC with a non-controlling interest reflected for the portion of Zevia LLC not owned by Zevia PBC.

Business
 Zevia is a high-growth beverage company that is disrupting the liquid refreshment beverage industry with great tasting reduced/zero calorie, zero sugar, naturally sweetened beverages. We offer a portfolio of products of carbonated and non-carbonated soft drinks under the Zevia® brand name that include a broad variety of flavors across Soda, Energy Drinks, Organic Teas, Mixers, Kidz drinks, and Sparkling Water. All Zevia® beverages are made with a handful of simple plant-based ingredients, contain no artificial sweeteners, and are all Non-GMO Project Verified, gluten-free, Kosher, vegan and zero sodium. Our products are distributed and sold principally across the U.S. and Canada through a diverse network of major retailers including grocery stores, natural products stores, warehouse club stores, specialty outlets, and through e-commerce channels. We believe that consumers increasingly select beverage products based on taste, ingredients and fit with today’s consumer preferences, which has benefited our brand and resulted in over one billion cans of Zevia sold to date.
 We are guided by our mission to support the health of individuals and the communities we serve by creating reduced/zero calorie, naturally sweetened beverages. This purpose sets the foundation for our existence, as we strive to make the world a better place. Our focus on environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, impact is core to how we do business, and we believe makes us a more successful company. These ideals are embodied through our “Certified B Corporation” status, and we are acutely focused on:
 •Improving Public Health: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that Americans are consuming too much added sugars in their diets, which can lead to health problems. One of the leading sources of added sugars in the U.S. diet is sugar-sweetened beverages. Our products help consumers reduce their sugar intake and avoid artificial ingredients by offering a refreshing and enjoyable zero sugar, naturally sweetened alternative to high-sugar and artificially sweetened competitors. We estimate that by choosing Zevia, our consumers have eliminated almost 53,000 metric tons of sugar from their diets since 2011.
 •Providing Access: We are committed to supporting underserved communities by partnering with health professionals such as dietitians and nutrition educators to provide health-focused educational materials, webinars and product samples that educate patients and address the effects of sugary beverage consumption. Our products are priced at an average retail cost per ounce of $0.07, representing the 36th percentile within all non-alcoholic, ready-to-drink beverages, excluding dairy and non-dairy protein, therefore is less expensive than 64% of non-alcoholic beverage options, making Zevia affordable for a broad range of income levels. 


•Delivering Sustainability: We actively seek to minimize our environmental impact and continuously re-evaluate our packaging formats and processes to limit environmental waste. We have never sold a single plastic bottle, which we estimate has eliminated 800 million plastic bottles from littering our roadways, our waterways, and our communities by selling only aluminum packaging since 2011. In addition, one of our main ingredients, stevia, requires less agricultural water resources than sugar, furthering our sustainability mission.
 •Creating An Inclusive Company Culture: Our social impact mission extends beyond the can and is embedded in the way we treat our people—all full-time Zevia employees have an equity interest in the Company, are paid a fair wage and receive competitive benefits.
 •Driving Positive Social Change: We are a Delaware public benefit corporation and have been designated as a “Certified B Corporation” by B Lab, an independent non-profit organization, in recognition that we balance profit and purpose to meet the highest verified standards of social and environmental performance, public transparency and legal accountability.
 Certified B Corporation
 Consistent with our focus on ESG and social impact, while not required by Delaware law or the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we have elected to have our social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency assessed against the proprietary criteria established by B Lab, an independent non-profit organization. As a result of this assessment, we have been designated as a Certified B Corporation.
 In order to be designated as a Certified B Corporation, companies are required to take a comprehensive and objective assessment of their positive impact on society and the environment. The assessment evaluates how a company’s operations and business model impacts its workers, customers, suppliers, community and the environment using a 200-point scale. While the assessment varies depending on a company’s size (number of employees), sector and location, representative indicators in the assessment include payment above a living wage, employee benefits, stakeholder engagement, supporting underserved suppliers and environmental benefits from a company’s products or services. After completing the assessment, B Lab will verify the company’s score to determine if it meets the 80-point minimum bar for certification. The review process includes a phone review, a random selection of indicators for verifying documentation and a random selection of company locations for onsite reviews, including employee interviews and facility tours. Once certified, every Certified B Corporation must make its assessment score transparent on B Lab’s website.
 Acceptance as a Certified B Corporation and continued certification is at the sole discretion of B Lab. To maintain our certification, we will be required to update our assessment and verify our updated score with B Lab every three years.
 Public Benefit Corporation Status
 In line with our mission to support the health of individuals and communities we live in, we have elected to be treated as a public benefit corporation under Delaware law.
Under Delaware law, a public benefit corporation is required to identify in its certificate of incorporation the public benefit or benefits it will promote and its directors have a duty to manage the affairs of the corporation in a manner that balances the pecuniary interests of the corporation’s stockholders, the best interests of those materially affected by the corporation’s conduct, and the specific public benefit or public benefits identified in the public benefit corporation’s certificate of incorporation. Public benefit corporations organized in Delaware are also required to assess their benefit performance internally and to disclose to stockholders at least biennially a report detailing their success in meeting their benefit objectives.
 As provided in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the public benefits that we promote are: to (i) create and provide better-for-you beverages, food or other products that support the health of our consumers and their communities, (ii) promote the wellbeing of our employees in a supportive and empowering environment and (iii) forge an enduring profitable business.
Products
 Our platform of tasty and "better-for-you" beverages combined with our global mission and core set of values has been validated by our resonance with consumers and our growth in sales.
 



Since our founding in 2007, we have grown from three flavors of soda to a platform brand with six product lines and approximately 40 flavor variations. Each of our product lines has been carefully crafted for consumer enjoyment, ensuring that flavor is not sacrificed in the process of eliminating unhealthy sugar and artificial ingredients including coloring, preservatives and flavors. In addition, continuous improvement is a Zevia core value, and as such we strategically reformulate our products to further enhance taste and simplify ingredients.
 Soda. Soda, our flagship product released in 2008, is the better-for-you alternative to conventional sodas and diet sodas with no artificial ingredients. Our Soda is available in 15 different flavors. Our Soda sales constituted approximately 87% of our net sales in 2021.
 Energy. Energy drinks are zero sugar energy drinks that contain 120 mg of organic caffeine. We offer Energy in six flavors: Grapefruit, Kola, Mango Ginger, Raspberry Lime, Pineapple Paradise and Strawberry Kiwi. We released our Energy drinks in 2016.
 Mixers. Mixers are our non-alcoholic mixers that are meant to complement any cocktail or mocktail or can be enjoyed straight out of the can. We offer Mixers in three flavors: Ginger Beer, Tonic and Lemon Lime with Bitters. We released our Mixers in 2017.
 Organic Tea. Our Organic Tea is a pioneer in the zero calorie, naturally sweetened ready-to-drink tea segment, and was released in 2018. Zevia Organic Tea is USDA Organic and brewed with Fair Trade Certified Tea. We offer Organic Tea in eight flavors, including two caffeine-free options.
 Kidz. Kidz is our product line for kids, packaged in smaller cans for smaller hands, and the right size for lunch boxes and afternoon snacks. Our Kidz drinks are available in six kid-friendly flavors and were released in 2020.
 Sparkling Water. Sparkling Waters are lightly flavored sparkling water. We offer Sparkling Water in two flavors: Blackberry and Cucumber Lemon. We released our Sparkling Waters in 2016.
 


We benefit from sustained shifts across the liquid refreshment beverage market. Consumers are becoming more health conscious and focused on reducing sugar in their diets and are increasingly averse to added sugars versus naturally-occurring sugars. Many consumers are making choices with sustainability in mind, including plastic waste reduction. As a great-tasting, clean label beverage supporting a positive environmental and social impact, we are positioned to appeal to a broad range of consumer needs in our current markets and beyond.
 Consumers can purchase our products in both brick and mortar and e-commerce channels. We are an omnichannel brand found in more than 31,000 stores across the traditional Grocery channel, Natural Grocery channel, Warehouse Club channel, Drug channel, and e-commerce platforms.
Industry Overview
 We believe there is a sustained shift in consumer demand for better-for-you products that is transforming the $771 billion global liquid refreshment beverages market. This market, which is expected to grow at a 1.4% compound annual growth rate from 2019 to 2025 according to Euromonitor, is comprised of a broad set of categories that includes both current and potential Zevia offerings: soft drinks, energy drinks, ready-to-drink teas and coffees, mixers, kids beverages, sparkling water, isotonics and juice. Our categories have tremendous reach, creating significant runway to extend the Zevia® brand.
 The global beverages industry is comprised primarily of legacy, multinational category leaders. Consumer mega-trends, including growing concerns about the negative health impacts of sugar, consumers’ perception of artificial ingredients and the proliferation of plant-based alternatives, have allowed for emerging brands with reduced sugar products and natural product formulations to disrupt the status quo and capture market share from incumbent category leaders.
Consumer Mega-Trends Driving Category Growth
 •Health and Wellness—health and wellness has become a significant focus in our everyday lives, especially for the growing Millennial and Gen-Z demographics. According to Euromonitor, the global health and wellness beverage category generated $301 billion in retail sales in 2020 and grew at a 2.0% CAGR from 2018 to 2020, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.8% from 2019 to 2025.
 •Plant-Based Alternatives—the proliferation of plant-based alternatives has accelerated in conjunction with consumer concern with sugar content in their diets. U.S. adults have become more concerned with the level of sugar in their diets, and are particularly concerned with sugar content in their sodas and carbonated beverages.
 •Sustainability and Transparency—sustainability and transparency are influencing consumers’ purchase decisions, which we believe makes them more inclined to choose brands with post-consumable or recyclable packaging and ethical supply chain practices.
 •Omnichannel—consumers are changing the way they shop, and the brand discovery and selection process has migrated from retail locations to online. For omnichannel brands, e-commerce is both a transaction and a discovery opportunity, and this trend has benefited from a meaningful acceleration over a multi-year period.
 We believe that consumers are seeking out brands they can trust and that align with their values, and that they are becoming increasingly aware of the harmful effects of sugar. At Zevia, it is part of our mission to both educate consumers and offer a solution. Non-diet soft drinks make up almost half of total added sugars for American consumers according to the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, with most 12-ounce cans of sugar-laden soda containing 35 to 45 grams of sugar. Consuming sugary drinks regularly can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and other chronic diseases. Our products enable consumers to cut their added sugar intake in half without sacrificing flavor. Given the extensive availability of scientific and health data, consumers are becoming more aware of the benefits of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and a clean environment. Today’s consumers expect more than just a refreshing moment from the beverage brands they purchase, which presents an opportunity for better-for-you and socially responsible brands to gain share and redefine the future of the beverage industry. We believe we are poised to benefit from these shifts in shopper patterns and the evolving landscape going forward.
 Reduced/Zero Calories Sodas were a $7.6 billion segment in 2021, growing 10% versus 2020. These beverages can help address global health concerns, as well as reduce environmental impacts like plastic pollution. We believe consumer awareness of the negative health and environmental impacts of traditional, sugar-laden beverages is changing and accelerating the trajectory of our industry. In addition to shifting consumer preferences, regulatory changes are driving growth as well with governments in more than 50 jurisdictions imposing various taxes on sugary beverages.
 Our Strengths
 A Powerful Brand Platform Built Upon a Core Set of Values
 We have established an authentic, trusted brand that supports the health of individuals. The Zevia® brand promise is to offer delicious beverages that are better-for-you and better for the environment. We take pride in our ability to educate our consumers and our communities about the harmful effects of sugar, and the value of reducing plastic waste by using only aluminum cans as beverage containers. We market Zevia under one unified brand across multiple beverage categories, including Soda, Energy Drinks, Ready-To-Drink Teas, Mixers, Kidz drinks and Sparkling Water. We believe our brand has extensive consumer reach potential, as we deliver beverage offerings with a diversity of flavors and categories that appeal to every family member, time of day, and usage occasion. This is evidenced by our #1 brand ranking within carbonated soft drink brands in the Natural Enhanced channel according to SPINS, and as the #1 selling carbonated soft drink brand on Amazon in 2021 based on dollar sales according to Stackline.
Passionate and Loyal Consumer Base
 We measure loyalty, or “share of stomach,” based on how much brand purchasers spend on that brand, as a percentage of their total category spending. Our brand has grown significantly over the past decade, which has been largely tied to a dedicated and growing consumer base. In 2021 Zevia added one million new households to the brand and expanded purchasing options across new channels, such as Warehouse Club, with Zevia variety offerings that satisfy the entire household. Additionally, we believe our repurchase rate compares favorably relative to those same category leading brands.
 Our consumers are our best advocates and their loyalty is rooted in their alignment with our messaging and mission. Our consumer base over-indexes to Millennials, whom we believe will continue to favor our better-for-you, more sustainable liquid refreshment beverages as they age. Our consumer base also includes families and health-conscious consumers, whom we believe increasingly seek better-for-you options and are driven less by discounts. We believe the majority of Zevia consumers come from other traditional and low-calorie soda brands, a meaningful share of consumers purchase Zevia as an incremental beverage and a handful of consumers migrate from energy drinks, juice and waters. We believe that consumers care about their diets and their planet, and are willing to pay a premium for those attributes. Zevia drinkers have historically increased their brand spending over time, and tend to spend more on average than traditional shoppers within the soft drink, energy and ready-to-drink tea categories. According to Numerator data for the 12 months ending December 31, 2021, Zevia households increased their total spend on Zevia, purchased the brand more often, and spent more on the brand on every trip. Those households most engaged with the brand and purchasing multiple product lines increased their purchases even more, spending 2-3x more than the average for total Zevia households as they tried additional products across the Zevia portfolio.
 Asset-Light Business Model
 Our business is supported by a flexible and efficient supply chain that currently has the capacity to support our continued growth. Our beverages are produced and distributed through a network of third-party contract manufacturers, logistics providers and distribution centers, as well as one fully-owned warehouse and distribution center. We have valuable, long-standing relationships across our supply chain, creating an expansive supply network with large capacity for continued growth that allows us to more closely focus on executing our strategic initiatives across sales, marketing, innovation and ESG.
We continue to invest in innovation, new product development, supply chain capabilities and marketing initiatives, as we believe the demand for our products will continue to increase globally across both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce channels.
Our asset-light business model is designed to leverage reduced costs and overhead and supports our strategic initiatives and financial flexibility.


We work closely with our external supply chain to maximize forward-looking capacity and take a thoughtful approach to how we can leverage our existing relationships with our innovation efforts. Over time, we expect to further benefit from economies of scale providing significant financial flexibility to continue to reinvest in our business as we scale.
 Leverage Our Platform and Mission to Increase Velocity and Expand Our Consumer Base
 We are undertaking a number of initiatives to increase product trial and enhance brand messaging, which include increased investments in digital marketing, constant innovation, and expanding distribution. According to Numerator, our household penetration of 5.4% during the year ended December 31, 2021 versus 4.6% during the year ended December 31, 2020 is extremely low when compared to 40% to 67% penetration of full calorie category brand leaders, and we see a meaningful opportunity to grow by increasing our brand trial alone. We anticipate that as we continue to scale and enter new categories and channels, more people will become aware of our brand and mission. As our brand trial grows, we expect to convert those consumers into repeat Zevia purchasers and to bring health-conscious consumers back to the fun and enjoyment of carbonated soft drinks.
Invest in Our Ongoing Innovation Efforts
 We are a mission-driven brand dedicated to addressing consumer needs by providing the best-tasting, highest-quality beverages to people. We have experienced consistent growth from our existing portfolio, and we foresee multiple opportunities to pursue meaningful innovation across categories, usage occasions, and day parts.
 We are extremely selective about the categories in which we choose to develop new products. At the heart of our innovation strategy is our consumer we have an unrelenting focus on ensuring we offer people the best tasting zero calorie, naturally sweetened beverages. We pioneered our first non-soda innovation in 2016, and have now expanded our innovation categories to include Energy (2016), Sparkling Water (2016), Mixers (2017), Organic Tea (2018), and Kidz drinks (2020).
 In addition to entering new categories, our innovation team is constantly assessing different ways to develop great tasting beverage products that enhance our brand. We plan to continue to grow our current portfolio through line extensions and additional flavors, as well as enhancing our ingredients and sustainable packaging formats to drive incremental purchases. Continually innovating our ingredients to find the optimal taste and redesigning our packaging to enhance sustainability and margin is a key driver of our future growth. In addition to introducing line extensions within our existing categories, we have a robust pipeline of new category innovations to thoughtfully and strategically roll out over time in order to capture as much share of stomach as we can.
 Continue to Expand Distribution Within Existing Channels
 We believe we have created a meaningful flywheel for consumer acquisition in which shoppers are able to discover and learn about and purchase our brand online and offline across multiple channels and platforms. Our online platforms serve as trial generating and transaction intensification opportunities, allowing for full Zevia portfolio offerings including our bestselling variety packs which stimulate significant consumer engagement. In addition to aiding Zevia in being the #1 total carbonated soft drink brand on Amazon, our e-commerce buyers are also heavily engaged with the brand offline. According to Numerator, 64% of Zevia shoppers who purchase us on Amazon in 2021 also purchase Zevia in brick-and-mortar retailers. Moreover, shoppers who buy Zevia products on Amazon spend 3.5x more on our brand across all channels on average.
Offline, we have strong, long-standing relationships with food, drug, mass and natural retailers with whom we can grow distribution and sales through increased store penetration and shelf space. In 2021 we gained both overall store distribution and increases in items carried in these existing channels. We increased our store count by more than 3,000 locations versus 2020 according to SPINS and Nielsen data. We also increased the number of overall Zevia items carried across retailers, particularly with the introduction of larger packs that satisfied consumer needs for stocking up at home. We believe that our brick-and-mortar retailers value Zevia’s continued sales growth and margin profile with significant upside with both overall store count growth with major retailers and with expansion of items carried in each store.
Capitalize on Significant Distribution Opportunities
 We believe we will leverage our history of success across existing channels and apply it to building a presence in new ones.
 Beyond our existing channels, we believe there is significant opportunity to continue expanding distribution and total item availability in the drug, warehouse club, convenience, and foodservice channels in order to be everywhere our shoppers are seeking to buy us.
 We believe our products’ accessible price point, the broad demographic segments to which we appeal, and the core values of the Zevia® brand provide the opportunity to become a leader in each of the retail channels in which beverages are distributed. Entering new channels will not only provide volume growth for our brand but will also enhance our omnichannel strategy and raise awareness of our brand among new potential enthusiasts.
 Innovation
 Innovation is an integral part of what we do. We constantly look for ways to improve product taste, expand our offerings across categories and usage occasions, improve the sustainability of our packaging formats and simplify our plant-based ingredients.
 Our product development team collaborates across our organization and supplier base to identify areas to improve our existing offerings and create new offerings. Our development team coordinates the creation, testing, launch and improvement of our products in collaboration with our suppliers. We employ in-house food scientists to help create the next iterations of our products.
 We have refined the formulas of our products to ensure they meet our shoppers’ evolving taste profile, and have launched line and flavor extensions within existing categories to further fulfill consumer needs. Our robust pipeline of new category innovations allows us to thoughtfully and strategically enter new segments within the beverage space and maximize share of stomach by offering flavors and beverages for every family member.
 Our team is also working to improve our ingredients and packaging. Our main ingredient, after carbonated water, is stevia sweetener, which is extracted from the leaves of the stevia rebaudiana plant, the leaves of which contain many different naturally-occurring sweet compounds called steviol glycosides (“SG”). Each specific SG has a unique taste perception property, and is present in the leaf at widely differing percentages, driving cost differences between high-content SGs and low-content SGs. We have continually refined our stevia blend to maintain leadership in our sweetener system and currently use a specific stevia extract product that contains a particular blend of SGs that was found to perform the best across our beverage platform,

providing more rounded sweetness with minimal aftertaste commonly associated with prior stevia sweeteners. In addition, we continuously evaluate and research alternate ingredients, including plant-based sweeteners other than stevia extract, that may meet or exceed our sensory and cost standards. We also assess how we can reduce our carbon footprint and plastic waste through our packaging. We believe that by consistently offering great tasting products that are all zero calorie and naturally sweetened, with sustainable packaging under one brand, we will attract consumers to our new flavors and categories.
 Sales and Marketing and Consumer Outreach
 Our marketing strategy is to target consumers as close to the point of purchase as possible, as we believe that many purchasing decisions are made in-store during the shopping experience. As such, we seek to deploy funding to enhance our presence at shelf, including shelf tags, product displays and other means to build consumer awareness. We also deploy marketing funds in-store, through advertising and couponing vehicles, and around the store via geotargeted digital advertising and offers. In addition, we seek to raise awareness of the Zevia® brand through advertising programs targeted to key lifestyle segments such as families, fitness communities, and consumers following special diets, whether elective or medically directed.
 Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Zevia conducted significant sampling activities, with the goal of driving increased consumer awareness and product trial. We paused these activities due to health concerns associated with COVID-19, but anticipate re-engaging in product sampling, both in-store and at sampling events outside of the store, when these opportunities return.
 From a messaging perspective, we aim to create authentic content that focuses on Zevia’s taste experience—flavor, sweetness, bubbles and enjoyment—without the guilt that comes from drinking sugary or artificially sweetened beverages. We believe that combining our focus on taste with the positive ESG benefits of our brand—zero sugar, zero plastic, and products that are affordable to consumers across a broad range of income brackets—creates a compelling proposition that will drive both initial product trial and ongoing brand consumption.
 Sales
 As of December 31, 2021, our sales team is comprised of 33 people. The team works in close coordination with a national network of broker and distributor sales teams that gives us access to accounts across the U.S.
Marketing and Social Media
 We are undertaking a number of initiatives to increase trial and enhance brand messaging through awareness-building tactics, which include an improved approach to digital-first marketing, innovation, and expanding distribution. Our omnichannel approach engages with consumers over multiple touchpoints throughout their product discovery journey, stimulating trial, and leverages our brand awareness to grow cross-portfolio velocities and market share.
 We maintain a website at https://www.zevia.com, which serves as the most comprehensive source of information regarding our products. Our website is used as a platform to introduce our entire brand portfolio, promote and sell our products, provide news, share recipes, highlight nutritional facts and provide general information on where to purchase our products.
 We also use social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter for online collaboration to support our brand awareness strategy. These platforms allow us to directly engage with our consumers and publish content related to our products, activities and company and to better connect with potential and existing consumers.
 Our Supply Chain
 Ingredients and Ingredient Suppliers
 The principal ingredients of our beverages, aside from carbonated water, are stevia sweetener, flavor and citric acid. Our stevia extract is sourced through a multi-year supply agreement with a large multi-national ingredient company with international agriculture operations and substantial research and development capabilities. Although we do not view our stevia blend as a commodity ingredient, we believe that we can, within a reasonable period of time, make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of an interruption of supply from our supplier. Our product development team provides ongoing sensory and cost evaluation of competing stevia extract products as well as other plant-based sweeteners as a means of planning alternate sources of supply that meet or exceed our sensory expectations.
 Flavors are developed in collaboration with our product development team and our three flavor ingredient suppliers, as well as with our tea supplier. These suppliers produce and supply the unique flavor ingredients to our contract manufacturers. We do not have long-term supply agreements with these ingredient suppliers. For flavors and for our other ingredients, we believe that we can, within a reasonable period of time, make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of a supply interruption.
 Packaging and Packaging Suppliers
 We have chosen aluminum beverage cans as our primary packaging containers, which have the highest recycling rate of any beverage packaging format and a low carbon footprint in the supply chain. We source beverage cans through multiple suppliers, including a direct supply contract with a major can manufacturer, two agreements with contract manufacturers and opportunistic spot purchasing. Although the current global shortage of aluminum cans has broadly impacted the beverage industry, we have taken proactive measures, including diversifying our suppliers of aluminum cans and building finished goods and empty can inventory, which have allowed us to mitigate the risk of such shortage.
Manufacturing and Supply Planning
 We have relationships with four contract manufacturers who operate our manufacturing facilities across the U.S. and Canada. We currently produce Zevia products at over 17 of their locations. There is periodic entry into additional facilities, or exit from current facilities, owned by this network. We also may expand into additional facilities owned by contract manufacturers outside of our current network in 2022 to support growth plans as needed. This network allows us to mitigate supply risk in the event of a disruption at a specific facility and to disperse production geographically to reduce freight miles driven to distribute our products. Our contracts are typically in the form of multi-year master service agreements which define overall commercial and legal terms, while volume commitments, production costs and other services are typically re-evaluated annually or as-needed. The majority of such agreements are pricing and volume-based commitments rather than "take or pay", however we may enter into ‘take or pay’ arrangements to improve assurance of supply for both co-pack volume and aluminum cans.
Quality Control
 Upon receipt of ingredients, we receive certifications from our suppliers in order to confirm that they meet our specifications. Contract manufacturers perform in-process quality checks common to the carbonated soft drink industry, throughout the manufacturing process. We provide beverage specifications for every unique formula, as well as Zevia-specific quality requirements to our manufacturers to ensure they comply with our unique needs.
 Zevia personnel also conduct a secondary layer of quality control checks to identify any potential quality discrepancies not reported or identified by our contract manufacturers, and to document their ongoing performance. Our quality team places specific inventory on hold at all inventory locations if either the contract manufacturer or our quality team identifies any suspected discrepancy, to allow for immediate investigation and corrective action if necessary.
 Distribution
 We distribute our products from 12 distribution centers across the U.S. and Canada, from which we ship most products that we sell to our customers. We also have 13 repack locations and two consolidators used for specific customers. We generally manage the shipping of our products from our distribution centers to our customers. We periodically source freight lanes from carriers and freight brokers to help us manage costs, and seek to lock in rates for specified time periods. We have implemented a transportation management system to support the tendering, management and costs associated with our freight.
Competition
 We believe we compete broadly with all categories of liquid refreshment beverages. The beverage industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve in response to changing consumer preferences. Competition is generally based on brand recognition, taste, quality, price, ingredients, availability, selection and convenience, as well as factors related to corporate responsibility and sustainability. We believe we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors. Our competitors in the beverage market include category leaders such as The Coca-Cola Company, Keurig Dr. Pepper, PepsiCo, Inc., National Beverage Corp., Monster Energy, and Red Bull, as well as a range of emerging brands.
Human Capital Resources
 Zevia’s passion to democratize healthier lifestyles -- by providing affordable, better-for-you, naturally-sweetened beverages without sugar or calories and never in plastic containers – is reflected in the organization’s people and culture. We offer a diverse, inclusive and challenging work environment comprised of team members who are representative of the communities we serve. Our core values - passion, respect, gratitude, learning, a positive attitude, teamwork, continuous improvement, and living our best, – are at the foundation of our strategies to drive our mission and business. In order for us to attract and retain the best talent, we have an inclusive, strategic and well-defined human capital planning process and a management approach that aligns to our business needs and mission.
As of December 31, 2021, we had 119 full-time and 7 part-time team members in the United States, and 5 team members in Canada. We also utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. None of our team members is represented by a labor union. We maintain a strong relationship with our team members and have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage.
 Our Board of Directors provides oversight on certain human capital management matters, including through its Compensation Committee, which is responsible for governance over policies regarding human capital, diversity and inclusion, pay equity, recruiting, retention, training and development, safety, and creating a working environment consistent with our culture, objectives and strategy.
 Employee Health and Safety during COVID-19
 The health, safety and well-being of our team members is our top priority. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and based upon the guidance of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, OSHA, and local health authorities, we put appropriate measures in place to help reduce the spread of infection to our team members and customers, including the institution of social distancing protocols and increased frequency of cleaning and sanitizing in our offices and warehouse. This included the implementation of a company-wide remote work policy where all team members outside of our warehouse team, including hourly employees, are provided with the ability to work from home. We transformed our business communications to video conferencing as our preferred communication format. We have also limited employee business travel to only essential business needs. We developed strict protocols for any Headquarters visit, to include COVID-19 safety guidelines, a CDC attestation survey, and a tracker to document every visit.
 We have custom Injury and Illness Prevention Programs for headquarters and warehouse operations. The latter includes safety training for all employees, including certified forklift drivers, and safety walk-throughs.
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion starts at the top with a highly skilled, diverse group in both gender and race, and representative board of directors and executive leadership team. We promote diversity, equity and inclusion at all levels of our organization, and our senior leadership team takes full ownership of and responsibility for our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and programs.

Zevia promotes equity through consistency and fairness with our people policies and practices that offer access, opportunity, and career growth for all team members equally. We have best practice standards across all stages of the employee lifecycle including performance standards. Promotions, compensation and growth opportunities are impartial, just and transparent. We also offer a consistent level of discretionary bonus and long-term incentive compensation in the form of equity for all levels of the organization, including hourly employees. Everyone is an owner at Zevia and we work together as one team to deliver results and achieve performance.
 Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Taskforce, comprised of a diverse group of representatives from all levels of the organization, aims to give our team members a voice in DEI work and allows different perspectives to shape and hold accountable and transparent our people policies and practices. In partnership with our People team, the taskforce prioritizes topics related to the lifecycle of an employee's experience at Zevia and through a DEI lens, offers suggestions for improvement. Team members participate in the DEI Taskforce for approximately 12-months and regularly report on its work, priorities and accomplishments to the overall organization, to foster transparency and trust.
 Culture and Engagement
 Our team drives the success of our brand, and every leadership or full team engagement features a conscious effort to engage and communicate with a focus on our values. We celebrate team member life events, offer company Z-clubs to promote team engagement across diverse topics to drive inclusion, and maintain an intranet for internal communication, peer-to-peer feedback, and company news.
In order to ensure that we are meeting our human capital objectives we frequently utilize internal employee surveys to understand the effectiveness of our people programs and where we can improve across the organization. Our team also has access to participate in independent third-party surveys through Comparably.com, providing qualitative results that reported a rating of 4.6 out of 5 stars for Company Culture, and 98 out of 100 stars for CEO Rating.
In 2021, the Company was recognized with the following nine awards from Comparably.com, measured by anonymous employee surveys: 2021 Best Company For Women, 2021 Best Company Culture, 2021 Best Company Perks & Benefits, 2021 Best Company Career Growth, 2021 Best CEOs for Diversity, 2021 Best CEOs for Women, 2021 Best Teams Operations, 2021, Best Company Los Angeles, and 2021 Best Company Outlook.
 Talent Acquisition
 We hired 44 new team members in 2021, 95.5% of which were sourced by internal recruitment. As part of our DEI initiative, we have implemented best-in-class recruitment practices to remove bias in the selection process and we reflect our values to candidates through job description language using gender-neutral pronouns, no video calls during the first interview, and standard assessments for applicable roles. We find candidates through a wide variety of sources to expand diversity, we offer flexible education requirements by role, and structure interviews with consistent processes to minimize bias. We conduct transparent, collaborative and panel interviews for group input on all hires.
Benefits and Compensation Strategies
 Our compensation program is designed to ensure our talented team is fairly paid and well rewarded for performance. The foundation of our compensation policy is a base salary and a performance-based bonus with targets tied to the Company’s annual financial performance. We regularly review and survey our compensation and benefit programs against the market, to ensure we remain competitive in our hiring practices. We aim for equity and make conscious efforts to close the pay equity gap through market adjustments and new-hire offers considered, with thorough and transparent analysis.
 Every full-time team member is eligible to receive equity-based compensation, which provides a sense of ownership and next-level engagement among employees at all levels. Zevia also offers a Fortune-500 style benefits package that incorporates a robust contribution for all tiers of coverage to include: medical, dental, vision, voluntary life & AD&D, critical illness, hospital indemnity, accident, short-term and long-term disability insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts, pet insurance, legal access, and ID protection. We offer a 401(k) Safe Harbor Retirement savings plan with Company matching contributions and no vesting schedule. We have comprehensive paid time off and sick policies, paid bereavement, holidays, flexible schedules, remote work, employee assistance programs, and a generous parental leave policy.
The same policies apply worldwide, with consistent competitive benefit packages for all team members but tailored to market-specific practices.
 Training and Organizational Development
 Our team members have access to various internal and external formal training and development courses to support individual growth. We offer an annual professional development allowance for continued advancement, with focus on a team member’s career path at Zevia. We seek to promote from our internal talent pool as part of our enterprise-wide succession plan. Our internal trainings include custom trainings by department and role, 100% participation in DEI training, and management training and development. In 2021, we launched Zevia University where we offer unlimited courses online for all levels of employees, to enhance soft skills, professional acumen and discipline-specific skills. Out of 108 invited learners, 85% joined the program and 51% were active learners in 2021.
Performance Management
 We are focused on setting clear and specific expectations for performance that align with individual strengths and company objectives. We believe in a customized approach, where high-performers are rewarded. Our managers complete 90-day reviews for new hires, annual reviews for all employees, goals management throughout the year via an online portal, incorporate short- and long-term career goals during each review, and conduct regular one-on-one sessions to provide feedback, coaching and support. Our approach is designed to foster accountability, transparency and recognition, which drives both retention and high performance. Our 2021 turnover rate for full time employees was 9.6% relative to headcount.
 ESG and Social Impact
 We are dedicated to acting responsibly and strive to do our part in making the world a better place with every drink. We are committed to creating real ESG impact through combatting the harmful effects of sugar, reducing plastic waste, democratizing healthier lifestyles and fostering an employee-centric culture.


As a public benefit corporation, it is core to our mission to support the health of our consumers. Our products help consumers reduce their sugar intake and avoid artificial ingredients by offering a refreshing and enjoyable zero sugar, naturally sweetened alternative to high-sugar and artificially sweetened competitors. We estimate that by choosing Zevia, our consumers have eliminated over 53,000 metric tons of sugar in their diets since 2011.
 Sustainable packaging is a top priority for us and we actively seek to minimize our environmental impact. Since our founding in 2007, we have never sold a beverage in a plastic bottle. Through only using aluminum cans, we estimate that we have saved over 18,000 metric tons of plastic since 2011. In addition, we reduce use of packaging materials where possible. For example, we have eliminated corrugate trays from our supply chain for our ten pack Soda items and eliminated plastic rings from our Canadian six pack Soda items, replacing those with a recyclable cardboard overwrap.
 We also know health equality is about ensuring that consumers in underserved communities can find sustainable ways to maintain healthy lifestyles, and so we partner with thousands of health professionals across the U.S. and Canada to support their educational initiatives. These include dietitians, nutrition educators, and other health professionals. We provide both educational materials about dietary changes that can support patients’ health conditions, and also samples of Zevia products, which align with the smarter dietary choices and lifestyle changes these health professionals advocate.
 Seasonality
 As is typical in the beverage industry, sales of our beverages are seasonal, with the highest sales volumes generally occurring in the second and third fiscal quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets. As our business continues to grow, we expect to see continued seasonality effects, with net sales tending to be greater in the second and third quarters of the year.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 We own domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business, including our principal trademark, Zevia. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained. All of our material trademarks are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Our trademarks are valuable assets that reinforce the distinctiveness of our brand to our consumers. We have applied for or have trademark registrations internationally as well. We believe the protection of our trademarks and domain names is important to our success.
 We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademark laws and other laws related to proprietary rights around the world. Our domain name is https://www.zevia.com.
Government Regulation
 In the normal course of our business, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. Regulations apply to many aspects of our business, including our products and their ingredients, manufacturing, safety, labeling, transportation, recycling, advertising and sales.
 Our products are regulated in the United States as conventional foods. Our products and their manufacturing, labeling, marketing and sale in the U.S. are subject to stringent regulations and standards established by, among others, the FTC, the FDA, the USDA, the EPA, OSHA and similar state and local agencies. The regulations and standards include various aspects of the FDCA, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Food Safety Modernization Act, the Lanham Act, state consumer protection laws and state warning and labeling laws, such as Proposition 65 in California. Under these statutes, federal and state agencies regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, preparation, quality control, import, export, packaging, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, marketing, advertising, promotion, distribution, safety, and/or adverse event reporting of conventional foods. Among other things, manufacturers of conventional foods must meet current good manufacturing practices and other requirements applicable to the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding of foods. In addition, our products are manufactured pursuant to special certification programs such as those for organic, kosher, and non-GMO products among others, and we must comply with strict standards imposed by federal, state, and third-party certifying organizations.
 Pursuant to the Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”), the FDA promulgated additional requirements to enhance food safety and prevent food contamination, including more frequent inspections and increased recordkeeping and traceability requirements. The FSMA also holds imported foods to the same standards as domestic foods. The FDA requires that certain nutrient and product information appear on product labels and that the labels and labeling be truthful, not misleading. Similarly, the FTC requires that marketing and advertising claims be truthful, not misleading, not deceptive to customers and substantiated by adequate scientific data. We are also restricted from making certain claims about our products, including health claims, claims that our products treat, cure, mitigate or prevent disease or claims regarding the effects of our products on the structure or function of the body except under certain limited circumstances.
 Products that do not comply with any governmental or third-party regulations and standards may be considered adulterated or misbranded and we may face adverse consequences, including but not limited to, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, import holds, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, or criminal prosecution.
 Various states, provinces and other authorities require deposits, eco-taxes or fees on certain products or packaging. Similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the U.S. and elsewhere.
 We are also subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers.
 In Canada, the manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of our products are also subject to compliance with similar laws, rules and regulations.
