ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Effective January 21, 2021, we changed our name from Black Ridge Oil & Gas, Inc. to Sow Good Inc. (“SOWG,” “Sow Good,” or the “Company”). Our common stock is traded on the OTCQB under the trading symbol “SOWG”.
 
During 2021, the Company launched a line of freeze-dried snacks, smoothies, soups and granola. We are marketing our line of products via our direct-to-consumer focused website, as well as via the business-to-business sales channel.
 
Our business operates under two distinct brands, Sow Good and Sustain Us. Our unique food products are target the large, and growing, freeze-dried food products market. The global freeze-dried food products market is estimated by Technavio to total nearly $60B in 2020, with the United States representing almost 30% of the total. Technavio further projects market growth to continue at over 8% per year through 2024.
 
With the extensive freeze-dried manufacturing and food product-focused business development experience of our senior management team, including recent additions, we believe we are well positioned to lead the Company's growth and development in the freeze-dried food industry.
 
S-FDF Business Combination
 
On October 1, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of S-FDF, LLC (the "Seller"), a Texas limited liability company, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, between the Company and the Seller, dated June 9, 2020, as subsequently amended effective October 1, 2020. In connection with the closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired approximately $2.2 million in cash and certain assets and agreements related to the Seller’s freeze-dried fruits and vegetables business for human consumption and entered into certain employment and registration rights agreements. The Company did not assume any liabilities of Seller or any liabilities, liens, or encumbrances pertaining to or encumbering the Purchased Assets, except for those related to agreements or arrangements specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Seller transferred the Purchased Assets to the Company in exchange for the issuance of 1,120,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to the Seller. The number of Seller Shares to be issued was subject to adjustment, as specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement, as amended, based on the extent to which the amount of cash proceeds held by the Company, as derived from the sale of the Company’s holdings of Allied Esports Entertainment Inc. ("AESE") Shares, were less than $5 million or greater than $6 million on the date specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement, which resulted in the issuance of an additional 500,973 Seller Shares that were issued on January 4, 2021. The combined issuances represented approximately 46% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock, on a fully diluted basis. Black Ridge Oil & Gas, Inc. was determined to be the acquiror of the business combination.
 
Pursuant to its obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement, on the Closing Date the Company, (a) created three new seats on the Company’s Board of Directors and appointed the Seller’s principals, Ira Goldfarb and Claudia Goldfarb, and a third person designated by the Goldfarbs, Greg Creed, as directors, (b) entered into employment agreements with Ira Goldfarb and Claudia Goldfarb, (c) delivered a registration rights agreement with respect to the Seller Shares and any shares of common stock delivered as part of the employment compensation for Ira Goldfarb or Claudia Goldfarb, and (d) amended the Company’s 2020 Stock Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved thereunder. At closing, the Company also assumed the Seller’s obligations under a real property lease for its facility in Irving, Texas under which an entity owned entirely by Ira Goldfarb is the landlord.

BRAC Business Combination
 
On October 10, 2017, the Company’s sponsored special purpose acquisition company, Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. (“BRAC”), completed an IPO raising $138,000,000 of gross proceeds (including proceeds from the exercise of an over-allotment option by the underwriters on October 18, 2017). In addition, the Company purchased 445,000 BRAC units at $10.00 per unit in a private placement transaction for a total contribution of $4,450,000 in order to fulfill its obligations in sponsoring BRAC, a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. BRAC’s efforts to identify a prospective target business were not limited to a particular industry or geographic region. Following the IPO and over-allotment, BROG owned 22% of the outstanding common stock of BRAC and managed BRAC’s operations via a management services agreement through December 31, 2019. On December 19, 2018, BRAC entered into a business combination agreement, which subsequently closed on August 9, 2019. BRAC was renamed Allied Esports Entertainment, Inc. following the merger, or “AESE”, and referred to herein, as such.
Going Concern Uncertainty
 
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a cash balance of $3,345,928 and total working capital of $4,488,207. We are too early in our development stage to project revenue with a necessary level of certainty; therefore, we may not have sufficient funds to sustain our operations for the next twelve months and we may need to raise additional cash to fund our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has commenced sales and continues to develop its operations. In the event sales do not materialize at the expected rates, management would seek additional financing or would attempt to conserve cash by further reducing expenses. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving these objectives.
 
We continue to pursue sources of additional capital through various financing transactions or arrangements, equity or debt financing or other means. Our ability to scale production and distribution capabilities and further increase the value of our brands, is largely dependent on our success in raising additional capital.
 
We may not be successful in identifying suitable funding transactions in a sufficient time period or at all, and we may not obtain the capital we require by other means. If we do not succeed in raising additional capital, our resources may not be sufficient to fund or expand our business.
 
The report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies its audited financial statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K contains an explanatory paragraph regarding the substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the going concern uncertainty.
