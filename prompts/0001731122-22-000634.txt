Company Overview
 
Data Storage Corporation, headquartered in Melville, New York, with its three subsidiaries, DSC, Flagship Solutions LLC and Nexxis, Inc., provides solutions and services to a broad range of clients in several industries, including healthcare, banking and finance, distribution services, manufacturing, construction, education, and government. The subsidiaries maintain business development teams, as well as independent distribution companies. As an example, the Company’s distribution channel of companies provides long-term subscription-based disaster recovery and cloud infrastructure without investing in the infrastructure, data centers, telecommunications or specialized technical staff, which substantially lowers their barrier of entry in providing these solutions to their client base. The distribution company has typically provided equipment and software. However, a client’s awareness in 2021 of the ability to migrate to an IBM Power cloud infrastructure and disaster recovery affords the distributor the ability to maintain the client and create an annuity year after year. To further support that awareness, over 55,000 visitors arrived at the Company’s website in 2021.
 
During 2021, based on the May capital raise and the up list to Nasdaq, the Company added distribution, business development representatives, marketing, and technical personnel. Management continues to be focused on building the Company’s sales and marketing strategy and expanding its technology assets throughout its data center network.
 
The Company’s business offices are located in New York and Florida. The offices include a technology center and lab, adapted to meet the technical requirements of the Company’s clients. The Company maintains its own infrastructure, storage, and networking equipment required to provide subscription solutions in seven geographically diverse data centers located in New York, Massachusetts, Texas, Florida and North Carolina, and in Canada, Toronto, and Barrie, serving clients in the United States and Canada.
 
The Company’s business continuity solutions allow clients to quickly recover from system outages, human and natural disasters, and cyber security attacks, such as Ransomware. The Company’s managed cloud services begin with migration to the cloud and provide ongoing system support and management that enables its clients to run their software applications and technical workloads in a multi-cloud environment. The Company’s cyber security offerings include comprehensive consultation and a suite of data security, disaster recovery, and remote monitoring services and technologies that can be incorporated into the Company’s cloud solutions or be delivered as a standalone managed security offering covering the client site endpoint devices, users, servers, and equipment.


Solution architects and the Company’s business development teams work with organizations identifying and solving critical business problems. The Company carefully plans and manages the migration and configuration process, continuing the relationship and advising its clients long after the services have been implemented. As of this filing, the Company has proposals outstanding of approximately $20 million in total contract value; and, total proposals outstanding for subscriptions solutions of approximately $14 million in total contract value. Reflecting on client satisfaction, the Company’s renewal rate on client subscription solutions is approximately 94% after their initial contract term expired.
 
The Company provides its clients subscription-based, long-term agreements for cloud disaster recovery, cloud infrastructure, telecommunications solutions, and high processing on-site computing power and software solutions. While a significant portion of the Company’s revenue has been subscription-based, it also generates revenue from the sale of equipment and software for cybersecurity, data storage, IBM Power systems equipment and managed service solutions. As of this filing the Company has a backlog of over $500,000 in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and equipment and software backlog of approximately $2 million.

Competitive Landscape
 
The markets for the Company’s products and services are competitive. However, competition is limited in the Company’s $46.7 billion marketplace, compared to the limitless competitors, competing against Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google, and Microsoft today which hold an estimated 51% of the marketplace for X86 cloud infrastructure and X86 disaster recovery platforms. Today, the IBM Power community, based on a recent IBM user survey, only 15% of the IBM Power server community utilizes the cloud. Other Company services and solutions, outside of the IBM Power user community face many competitors for cyber security and data analytics, however, these solutions and services are typically provided by the Company to their existing clients and distribution companies.
 
These markets are characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances. The Company’s financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product features, relative price and performance, product quality and reliability, strong third-party software, marketing and distribution capability, service and support and corporate reputation.
 
The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities globally related to disaster recovery and cloud infrastructure, primarily focused on the IBM community. These markets are highly competitive and include several large, well-funded and experienced participants.
 
The Company’s future financial condition and operating results depend on the Company’s ability to continue to provide a high-quality solution as well as increase distribution of the solutions in each of the markets in which it competes.

COVID-19
 
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was reported in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization determined that the outbreak constituted a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” and declared a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting businesses and affecting production and sales across a range of industries, as well as causing volatility in the financial markets. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s customer demand, sales and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including, among other things, the duration and spread of the outbreak and the impact on its customers and employees, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. See “Risk Factors” for information regarding certain risks associated with the pandemic.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated cloud transformation efforts for new and existing customers and underscored the importance and mission-critical nature of multi-cloud strategies. Over the last year, customers have increasingly turned to cloud solutions to pivot to new business models, improved their disaster recovery of mission-critical data, migrated to cloud-based solutions and reduced their capital expenditure requirements. 
 Since September 2021 the Company has adopted a hybrid model that allows for its employees to either work remotely utilizing solutions the Company provides to their clients and distribution channels, or work in its offices. Additionally, the Company’s remote, technology-enabled model has enabled minimal disruption to its go-to-market efforts and service delivery organizations. 
 
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a significant impact on the Company’s operations or financial performance; however, the ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and its impact on the Company’s customers, vendors and employees and its impact on its sales cycles as well as industry events, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.
 
The extent of the impact, if any, will depend on future developments, including actions taken to contain COVID-19. See also “Risk Factors” for more information.

The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and international laws with respect to its receipt, storage and processing of personal information and other customer data.
 
The Company receives, stores, and processes personal information and other customer data. Personal privacy has become a significant issue in the United States and in many other countries where the Company may provide its offering of solutions. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently complex and evolving, and it is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. There are numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other customer data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among countries or conflict with other rules. The Company generally seeks to comply with industry standards and is subject to the terms of its privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties. The Company strives to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations, and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection to the extent possible. Any failure or perceived failure by the Company to comply with its privacy policies, its privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, its privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other customer data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, or public statements against the Company by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause its customers to lose trust in it, which could have an adverse effect on its reputation and business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or industry practices regarding the use or disclosure of the Company’s customer’s data, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of customers for the use and disclosure of such data is obtained, could require the Company to modify its solutions and features, possibly in a material manner, and may limit its ability to develop new services and features that make use of the data that its customers voluntarily share with the Company.

The Company’s solutions are used by customers in the health care industry, and the Company must comply with numerous federal and state laws related to patient privacy in connection with providing its solutions to these customers. In particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) include privacy standards that protect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of individually identifiable health information and implementing data security standards. Because the Company’s solutions may backup individually identifiable health information for its customers, its customers are mandated by HIPAA to enter into written agreements with the Company known as business associate agreements that require it to safeguard individually identifiable health information. Business associate agreements typically include:
 

● | a description of the Company’s permitted uses of individually identifiable health information; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a covenant not to disclose that information except as permitted under the agreement and to make the Company’s subcontractors, if any, subject to the same restrictions; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | assurances that appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards are in place to prevent misuse of that information; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an obligation to report to the Company’s customers any use or disclosure of that information other than as provided for in the agreement; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a prohibition against the Company’s use or disclosure of that information if a similar use or disclosure by its customers would violate the HIPAA standards; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the ability of the Company’s customers to terminate their subscription to its solution if the Company breaches a material term of the business associate agreement and are unable to cure the breach; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the requirement to return or destroy all individually identifiable health information at the end of the customer’s subscription; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | access by the Department of Health and Human Services to the Company’s internal practices, books, and records to validate that the Company is safeguarding individually identifiable health information.
