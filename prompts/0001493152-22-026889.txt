ITEM 1 - BUSINESS 
GENERAL
 
NetSol Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq CM: NTWK) is a worldwide provider of IT and enterprise software solutions to the global finance and leasing industry. We believe that our solutions constitute mission critical applications for clients, as they encapsulate end-to-end business processes, facilitating faster processing and increased transactions.
 
NETSOL’s primary sources of revenues have been licensing, subscriptions, modification, enhancement and support of its suite of financial applications, under the brand name NFS Ascent® to leading businesses in the global finance and leasing space. With constant innovation being a major part of NETSOL’s DNA, we have enabled NFS Ascent® deployment on the cloud with several implementations already live and some underway. This shift to the cloud will enable NETSOL’s new customers to opt for a subscription-based pricing model rather than the traditional licensing model.
 
NETSOL’s clients include blue chip organizations, Dow-Jones 30 Industrials, Fortune 500 companies, financial institutions, global vehicle manufacturers through their captive finance companies (“auto captives”), unrelated automotive finance companies (“non-captives”), equipment finance and leasing companies, and banks. All of which are serviced by NETSOL’s strategically placed support and delivery locations around the globe.
 
Founded in 1997, NETSOL is headquartered in Calabasas, California. NETSOL follows a global strategy for sales and delivery of its portfolio of solutions and services through its offices in the following locations:
 

■ | North America | Los Angeles Area 
--+-------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Company Business Model
 
NETSOL believes that our technology solutions offer our customers a return on their investment and allow us to thrive in a hyper competitive and mature global marketplace. Our solutions are bolstered by our people. NETSOL believes that people are the drivers of success; therefore, we invest heavily in our hiring, training and retention of top-notch staff to ensure not only successful selling, but also the ongoing satisfaction of our clients. Taken together, this “selling and attentive servicing” approach creates a distinctive advantage for NETSOL and a unique value for its customers. NETSOL continues to underpin its proven and effective business model which is a combination of affordable pricing through effective cost arbitrage, subject matter expertise, domain experience, scalability and proximity with its global and regional customers.

Simultaneously, we are able to extend services and even support development through a combination of onsite and off-site resources. This approach has allowed us to offer blended rates to our customers by employing a unique and cost-effective global development model.
 
While our business model is built around the development, implementation and maintenance of our suite of financial applications, we have employed the same facilities and competencies to extend our offerings into related segments, including but not limited to:

PRICING AND REVENUE STREAMS
 
The company’s revenue streams are the outcome of the following four main areas:
 

■ | Product licensing 
--+------------------------------------------------------
■ | Subscription-based pricing 
■ | Implementation and customization-related services 
■ | Post implementation, support-related services 

 
License fees can range to a multi-million-dollar fee for single or multiple module implementations. License revenue is realized with traditional, non-SaaS-based agreements, whereas SaaS-based agreements do not contain license fees and are offered via flexible, value-driven, subscription-based pricing. There are various attributes which determine the level of pricing complexity, a few of which are: number of contracts; size of the portfolio; IT budgets; business strategy of the customer; internal business processes followed by the customer; number of business users; amount of customization required; complexity of data migration and branch network of the customer.
 
We recognize revenue from license contracts when the software has been delivered to the customer. Implementation-related services, including customization, configuration, data migration, training and third-party interfaces are recognized as the services are performed. Post implementation support services are then provided on a continued basis. The annual support fee, which typically is an agreed upon percentage of overall monetary value of the license, then becomes an ongoing revenue stream realized on a yearly basis. Revenue from software services includes fixed price and time and materials-based contracts and is recognized as the services are performed.
 
Additionally, in order to avoid lumpiness in our revenues and to ensure a predictable revenue base over coming years, the business has shifted to a pricing strategy whereby the business is now offering its cloud-ready products at SaaS/subscription-based pricing models. Rapid deployments coupled with affordable prices/payment schedules is expected to lead the business towards volume-based selling. Moreover, this value-driven pricing plan is intended to decrease the initial buy-in cost for new customers by eliminating heavy license fees, reduce the sales cycles and provide an alternative to current customers seeking lower software usage and maintenance costs.

GROWTH PROSPECTS FOR NFS ASCENT®
 
Growth prospects for NFS Ascent® are linked to the constant innovation in the product and its growing customer base across different geographic and product markets. NETSOL is eyeing key international markets for growth in sales. Its sales strategy not only focuses on expansion into new geographic markets, including the Americas, Europe, and further penetration of our leading position in Asia Pacific, but also within existing markets into new verticals with targeting of Tier 2 and Tier 3 prospects as well.
 
Growth in North America and Europe is expected to come from the potential market for replacement of legacy systems as well as acquisition of new customers. NFS Ascent® is aimed at providing a highly flexible and robust solution based on the latest technology and advanced architecture for North American and European customers looking to replace their legacy systems. We believe that NFS Ascent® can provide substantial competitive disruption to the market’s lagging technology provided by incumbent vendors. The existing customer base may also represent latent demand for increased service and support revenues by offering business process optimization, customization and upgrade services. With a market ready product with successful implementation, the prospects for NFS Ascent® in the region are positive.
 
Further traction in Europe will come from NFS Ascent® deployed on the cloud, which will continue to allow the Europe division to support not only larger organizations, but also small and medium sized organizations including startups.
 
Growth in NETSOL’s traditionally strong base in Asia Pacific is expected through diversification across market segments to include new customers in related banking and commercial lending areas. At the same time, the existing customer base is tapped for increased service and support revenues by offering enhanced features and new solutions to emerging customer needs. In addition, there is a potential for NFS Ascent® in Asia Pacific in the form of existing customers who are looking for replacement of their current system.
 
In China, NETSOL is a leader in the leasing and finance enterprise solution domain. With this position, NETSOL continues to enjoy demand for the current NFS™ solution, as well as NFS Ascent®. NETSOL will continue strengthening its position within existing multinational auto manufacturers, as well as local Chinese captive finance and leasing companies.
 
THE MARKETS 
 
We provide our services primarily to clients in global commercial industries. In the global commercial area, our service offerings are marketed to clients in a wide array of industries including, automotive, banks and other financial lending service companies.
 
The Asian continent, including Australia and New Zealand, from the perspective of marketing, are targeted by the Asia Pacific Region from our Bangkok, Beijing, Jakarta, Lahore, Shanghai, Tianjin and Sydney facilities. The marketing for our core offerings in the Americas and Europe is carried out from our Los Angeles Area and London Metropolitan Area and Horsham offices, respectively.
 
PEOPLE AND CULTURE

Our key values are delivering world-class quality solutions, client-focused timely delivery, leadership, long-term relationships, creativity, transparency and professional growth. The services provided by NETSOL require proficiency in many fields, such as software engineering, quality assurance, project management, business analysis, technical writing, sales and marketing, communication and presentation skills.

Due to the growing demand for our core offerings and IT services, retention of technical and management personnel is essential. Our employee turnover was under 16.04 % in 2022 with a goal to maintain the turnover level under 18% during the 2023 fiscal year and onwards. In addition, we are committed to improving key performance indicators such as efficiency, productivity and revenue per employee. 
 
To encourage all employees to build on our core values, we reward teamwork and promote individuals that demonstrate these values. We believe that our growth and success are attributable in large part to the high caliber of our employees and our commitment to maintain the values on which our success has been based. We support gender diversity on a global basis. We are an equal opportunity employer with the largest concentration of female employees in Lahore, Pakistan and our U.S. headquarters.
 
NETSOL believes it should give back to the community and employees as much as possible. Certain subsidiaries of NETSOL are located in regions where basic services are not readily available. Where possible, NETSOL acts to not only improve the quality of life of its employees, but also the standard of living in these regions. Examples of such programs are as follows:
 

■ | Literacy Program: Launched to educate children of our unskilled staff, the main objective of this program is to enable them to acquire basic reading, writing and arithmetic skills. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | Higher Education and Science and Research Institutions: In order to support higher education in Pakistan, we have contributed endowments to NUST, Forman Christian College, and a few other universities who are focused on science and engineering. 
■ | Noble Cause Fund: A noble cause fund has been established to meet medical and education expenses of the children of the lower paid employees. Our employees voluntarily contribute a fixed amount every month to the fund and NETSOL matches the employee subscriptions with an equivalent contribution amount. A portion of this fund is also utilized to support social needs of certain institutions and individuals, outside of NETSOL. 
■ | Day Care Facility: NETSOL’s human resources are its key assets and thus we take numerous steps to ensure the provision of basic comforts to our employees. In Pakistan, the provision of outside pre-school childcare is a rarity. With this in mind, a children’s day care facility has been created near NETSOL’s offices providing employees with peace of mind knowing their children are nearby and being taken care of by qualified staff in a child friendly facility. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the facility is temporarily closed. 
■ | Preventative Health Care Program: In addition to the comprehensive out-patient and in-patient medical benefits, preventive health care has also been introduced. This phased program focuses on vaccination of our employees against such diseases as Hepatitis – A/B, Tetanus, Typhoid, Flu and COVID-19 on a routine basis. 

 
There is significant competition for employees with the skills required to perform the services we offer. We run an elaborate training program for different cadres of employees to cover technical skills and business domain knowledge, as well as communication, management and leadership skills. We believe that we have been successful in our efforts to attract and retain the highest level of talent available, in part because of the emphasis on core values, training and professional growth. We intend to continue to recruit, hire and promote employees who share our vision.
 
As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately 1,781 employees; comprised of 80.4 % technical staff and 19.6 % non-IT personnel.
 
COMPETITION 
 
No company dominates the IT market in the space in which we compete. A substantial number of companies offer services that overlap and are competitive with those offered by NETSOL.
 
We compete chiefly against leading suppliers of IT solutions to the global asset finance and leasing industry, including, but not limited to, White Clarke Group, Alfa, Cassiopae, LineData, FIS, International Decision Systems (IDS) and Data Scan.
 
In the IT-based business services areas, we compete with both smaller local firms and many global IT services providers, including, but not limited to, Wipro, InfoSys, Satyam Infoway, HCL and TCS (Tata Consulting).
