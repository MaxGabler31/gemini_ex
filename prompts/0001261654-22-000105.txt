ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Founded in 1965, with more than 250,000 graduates in its history, Universal Technical Institute, Inc. (“we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading provider of transportation and technical training programs. As of September 30, 2022, we offered certificate, diploma or degree programs at 16 campuses across the United States under the banner of several well-known brands, including Universal Technical Institute (“UTI”), Motorcycle Mechanics Institute and Marine Mechanics Institute (collectively, “MMI”), NASCAR Technical Institute (“NASCAR Tech”), and MIAT College of Technology (“MIAT”). Additionally, we offer manufacturer specific advanced training (“MSAT”) programs, including student-paid electives, at our campuses and manufacturer or dealer sponsored training at certain campuses and dedicated training centers. We offer the majority of our programs in a blended learning model that combines instructor-facilitated online teaching and demonstrations with hands-on labs. 
All of our campuses are nationally accredited and are eligible for federal student financial assistance funds under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (“HEA”), commonly referred to as Title IV Programs, which are administered by the U.S. Department of Education (“ED”). Our programs are also eligible for financial aid from federal sources other than Title IV Programs, such as the programs administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) and under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. 
Business Model and Industry Partnerships
We serve students, partners and communities by providing quality education and training for in-demand careers. We continue to evolve our business model to provide our students with accessible, affordable training with a focus on bringing education to the students at convenient locations. The market for qualified service technicians across the programs that we offer is large and growing. The United States Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics (“U.S. DOL BLS”) estimates that an average of approximately 117,000 new job openings, due to growth and net replacements, will exist annually for newly trained technicians in the automotive, diesel, and collision fields through 2031. Additionally, the U.S. DOL BLS estimates that an average of 42,500 new jobs openings for industrial machinery mechanics, 47,600 new job openings for welders, 40,100 new job openings in the HVAC industry, 14,700 new job openings for computer-controlled machine tool operators, 13,100 new job openings for avionic technicians, 6,100 new job openings for robotics, 4,800 new job openings for marine and motorcycle technicians and 1,900 new job openings for wind turbine service technicians will exist annually for new entrants through 2031 in these fields. 
Our student recruitment efforts begin with our commitment to positive outcomes, both for our students and our industry relationships. We use a multi-touch media approach for our three primary admissions channels (high school, adult, and military) to enroll and start students, which involves national and local outreach to generate a high quality and quantity of prospective students. To maximize the likelihood of student retention and graduation, our admissions process is intended to identify students who have the desire and ability to succeed in their chosen program. In addition, we have established processes to identify students who may be in need of assistance to succeed in and complete their chosen program. To assist these students in graduating, we employ student service professionals that provide tutoring, and academic, financial, personal, and employment advisement. Additionally, as our campus locations do not offer housing for students, we have service professionals who leverage third-party relationships and assist our students in finding affordable housing near our campuses.
To ensure our programs provide students with the necessary hard and soft skills needed upon graduation, we have relationships with over 35 original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and industry brand partners across the country to understand their needs for qualified service professionals. Through our industry relationships, we are able to continuously refine and expand our programs and curricula. We believe our industry-focused educational model and national presence have enabled us to develop valuable industry relationships, which provide us with significant competitive advantages and supports our market leadership, along with enabling us to provide highly specialized education to our students, resulting in enhanced employment opportunities and the potential for higher wages for our graduates.
Our industry relationships also extend to thousands of local employers, after-market retailers, fleet service providers and enthusiast organizations. Other target groups for relationship-building, such as parts and tools suppliers, provide us with a variety of strategic and financial benefits that include equipment sponsorship, new product support, licensing and branding opportunities and financial sponsorship for our campuses and students.
Business Strategy
Our core business strategies are aligned with our mission to serve students, partners and communities by providing quality education and training for in-demand careers. Additionally, as we evolve our business model, we are focused on growth and diversification achieved through acquisitions, opening new campus locations, expanding program offerings, and new funding and business operating models. 
Recruit, Train and Identify Employment Opportunities for More Students
Our student recruitment efforts begin with our commitment to positive outcomes for our students and our industry relationships. Our responsibility to present job-ready graduates to employers requires that we recruit, enroll and train prospective students who have the drive and potential to successfully pursue a career in their field of training.
Our student recruitment efforts for prospective students are conducted through three admissions channels: 
•High School: Field-based representatives develop and maintain relationships with high school guidance counselors, teachers and administrators as well as local employers. These representatives generate student interest in pursuing a professional technician career path and our training programs through career presentations and workshops at high schools and career fairs and inviting students and their influencers on field trips and tours of our campuses and local employers’ businesses. 
•Adult: Campus-based representatives serve adult career-seeking or career changing students who typically inquire with our schools as a result of our advertising campaigns. 
•Military: Our military representatives are strategically located throughout the country. These representatives focus on building relationships with military installations in order to serve the needs of those transitioning from military service. 
We collaborate with employers to help prospective students and their families understand the potential career opportunities that may be available during and after completing one of our programs. As competition for the graduates we train grows, employers are increasingly partnering with us to raise awareness of the benefits of a technician career path for prospective students. 
Return on Education
We provide an excellent return on our students’ education investment by working with our industry partners to offer manufacturer-specific training that is tailored to industry standards and requirements, that improves students’ opportunities to find employment and maximizes their earnings potential. We actively engage transportation industry partners in defining our core curriculum and improving and expanding our MSAT courses. We regularly evaluate program offerings, schedules and locations that are most appealing to students and aligned with employer expectations. We also update and expand our core and MSAT courses to align our training programs with current industry standards and requirements. 
These unique industry-aligned course offerings make our students more valuable to employers by giving them training that is consistent with industry needs and rapidly changing technology and the opportunity to earn a variety of industry-recognized certifications and credentials. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to better meet the industry’s demand for skilled technicians.
We provide relevant services to assist students with possible tuition financing options, educational and career counseling, opportunities for part-time work while attending school, and ultimately, graduate employment. Our national career services team develops job opportunities and outreach, while our local career services teams advise active students on employment search and interviewing skills, facilitate employer visits to campuses, provide access to reference materials and assist with the composition of resumes.
Strengthen Industry Relationships
Our relationships with leading manufacturer brand partners and other strategic partners are important to our business. We deliver value to these partners and employers by functioning as an efficient hiring source and low cost training option for new and existing technicians. These relationships give us direct input on the latest needs and requirements of employers, which 

not only guides our prospective student recruitment, but also strengthens our curricula and our students’ opportunities for employment and higher earnings after graduation. In addition, our manufacturer brand partners support our students through manufacturer-paid courses, scholarships, tuition reimbursement programs and early employment initiatives. 
Growth and Diversification 
Our growth strategy is predicated on adding new campuses and expanding program offerings in the transportation and skilled trades fields. We also have the opportunity to pursue our growth strategy through acquisitions. With a national higher-education market in transition, we are exploring potential acquisition opportunities that would allow us to enter new markets, expand our presence in existing markets, broaden our program offerings, enter into adjacent markets such as other skilled trades or high demand energy, or that could drive significant cost and operational synergies.
Our diversification strategy is focused on program diversification by adding new disciplines; evolving our instructional and delivery model to leverage enabling technologies resulting in better usage of campus facilities and instructional costs per student; executing on new instructional strategies that drive student outcomes and allow the business to more effectively scale; and identifying and adding new ways for programs to be funded by and for students.
During the year ended September 30, 2022, we executed the following as part of our growth and diversification strategy: 
Acquisitions
•Entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Concorde Career Colleges, Inc. (“Concorde”) in May 2022. Concorde is a leading provider of industry-aligned healthcare education programs in fields such as nursing, dental hygiene and medical diagnostics. Concorde currently operates 17 campuses across eight states with approximately 8,000 students, and offers its programs in ground, hybrid and online formats. The acquisition aligns with our growth and diversification strategy, which is focused on offering a broader array of high-quality, in-demand workforce solutions which both prepare students for a variety of careers in fast-growing fields and help close the country's skills gap by leveraging key industry partnerships. On December 1, 2022, we closed the Concorde acquisition. 
•Completed the acquisition of MIAT College of Technology (“MIAT”) from HCP & Company on November 1, 2021. MIAT had an average of approximately 950 undergraduate full-time active students during the year ended September 30, 2022 through its campuses in Canton, Michigan and Houston, Texas. MIAT offers vocational and technical certificates as well as associates degrees in fields with robust and growing demand for skilled technical workers, including aviation maintenance, energy technology, wind power, robotics and automation, non-destructive testing, HVACR, and welding. The acquisition enables us to further expand our program offerings into growing industry sectors and rapidly expanding fields likely to be bolstered by technological innovation and the country’s focus on sustainable energy.

Affordability and Accessibility
During the year ended September 30, 2022, tuition at our UTI, MMI and NASCAR Tech campuses ranged from approximately $20,000 for our CNC program (lasting 36 weeks) to $60,000 for our Automotive and Diesel program with one specialized elective program (lasting 90 weeks). During fiscal 2022, tuition at our MIAT campuses ranged from approximately $20,000 for our Industrial Maintenance Technician program (lasting 28 weeks) to $50,000 for our Aviation Maintenance Technology program (lasting 96 weeks). During the year ended September 30, 2022, the average annual revenue per student was approximately $32,600, net of scholarships or grants funded by the institution. We are focused on making our training more affordable and accessible through financing options, proprietary loans, institutional and relocation grants, scholarships based on need and merit, and employer sponsored training and tuition reimbursement. During the year ended September 30, 2022, approximately 42% of our active students received a UTI-funded scholarship or grant and approximately 22% of active students received funding from the proprietary loan program. 
To maximize student affordability and speed to completion, we are working with high schools across the nation to increase our Technical Education Institutional Grant (“TEIG”) agreements. The TEIG agreements allow students who have completed course(s) related to their selected program of study to receive a corresponding tuition credit for up to six courses. Our students may opt out of the courses provided they pass an Advanced Placement Opportunities Test for each selected course. We have approximately 5,200 curriculum-specific TEIG agreements in place across the country. This represents approximately 6% of the high schools covered by our admissions teams. We continue to identify new opportunities to expand the volume of these curriculum-specific TEIG agreements.
In response to growing demand for trained technicians, our industry partners and employers are increasingly willing to participate in our students’ cost of education by providing them with scholarship money and relocation assistance to attend school and by offering our graduates tuition reimbursement plans and competitive compensation and benefit packages, including signing bonuses, relocation grants and tool incentives. There are over 5,700 employer location incentive opportunities, which when made available make our training programs more affordable for students and may provide them with valuable relationships or employment opportunities following graduation.
Student Enrollment 
We enroll students throughout the year, and courses typically start every three to six weeks. For the year ended September 30, 2022, our average number of undergraduate full-time active students was 12,838, representing an increase of approximately 11.7% as compared to 11,489 for the year ended September 30, 2021. A portion of this increase was due to our acquisition of MIAT which for the year ended September 30, 2022, had an average number of undergraduate full-time active students of 950. At September 30, 2022, our end of period number of undergraduate full-time active students was 14,380, an increase of 5.1% from our ending full-time enrollment of 13,682 at September 30, 2021.

Currently, our student body is geographically diverse. While our campus locations attract local students that live within 50 miles, we estimate that approximately 50% of our students elect to relocate to attend our programs, with this percentage varying across campuses and programs. Due to the seasonality of our business and normal fluctuations in student populations, we expect variability in our quarterly results. See "Seasonality" within Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and operating results.
Graduate Employment
Identifying employment opportunities and preparing our graduates for their future careers is critical to our ability to deliver value to our graduates from their education. Accordingly, we dedicate significant resources to maintaining an effective career services team. Our campus-based staff facilitate several career development processes, including instruction and coaching for interview skills, interview etiquette and professionalism. Additionally, the career services team provides students with reference materials and assistance with the composition of resumes. Finally, we place emphasis on and devote significant time to assisting students with part-time and graduate job searches.
We also have a centralized department whose focus is to build and maintain relationships with potential and existing national employers and develop graduate job opportunities and, where possible, relocation assistance, sign-on bonuses, tool packages and tuition reimbursement plans with our manufacturer brand partners and other industry employers. Together, the campuses and centralized department coordinate and host career fairs, industry awareness presentations, interview days and employer visits to our campus locations. We believe that our graduate career services provide our students with a compelling value proposition and enhance the employment opportunities for our graduates and are a competitive differentiator from other education institutions. 
Our employment rate for 2021 and 2020 graduates who were employed within one year of graduation was 82% and 80%, respectively. The employment calculation is based on all graduates, including those that completed MSAT programs, from October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021 and October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020, respectively, excluding graduates not available for employment because of continuing education, military service, medical reasons, incarceration, death or international student status. We count a graduate as employed based on a verified understanding of the graduate’s job duties to assess and confirm that the graduate’s primary job responsibilities are in his or her field of study. We verify employment by sending written verification requests to the graduate and/or the employer or collecting written information with all required elements. Verifications must include employer name, job duties, job title, hire date and employer contact information. Once we receive written verification from either source, the graduate is classified as employed in field as long as all verification requirements are met. If any information provided in a written format requires clarification, a call is made to clarify certain elements with notes documented in our student database. In instances where we are unable to obtain written verification, we also classify graduates as employed in field if we are able to obtain verbal verification, collecting the same information as noted above, from both the graduate and the employer. We periodically review a sample of employment verifications to ensure accuracy. 
The table below summarizes the graduate employment rate data(1): 

 | Year Ended September 30,
 | 2021 | | 2020
Graduate employment rate | 82 | % | | 80 | %
Graduates | 7,308 | | | 6,832 | 
Graduates available for employment | 6,914 | | | 6,476 | 
Graduates employed | 5,692 | | | 5,176 | 

(1)    We completed the acquisition of MIAT on November 1, 2021. As such, this table does not include the graduate employment rate data for MIAT graduates. 
Competition 
The for-profit, postsecondary education industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented, with no one provider controlling significant market share. We compete with other institutions that are eligible to receive Title IV funding, including not-for-profit public and private schools, community colleges and for-profit institutions which offer automotive, diesel, collision repair, motorcycle, marine, welding, CNC machining, aviation, HVACR, robotics, and closely related skilled 

trades training programs. Our competition differs in each market depending on the curriculum we offer and the availability of other choices, including job prospects. Other competitive factors that influence our ability to attract new students include the employment market, community colleges, other career-oriented and technical schools, and the military. 
Prospective students may choose to forego additional education and enter the workforce directly, especially during periods when the unemployment rate declines or remains stable as it has in recent years. This may include employment with our industry partners or with other manufacturers and employers of our graduates. 
We compete with local community colleges for students seeking programs that are similar to ours, mainly due to local accessibility, low tuition rates and in certain cases free tuition. Public institutions are generally able to charge lower tuition than our schools, due in part to government subsidies and other financial sources not available to for-profit schools. No single community college is a significant competitor; rather, the sector as a whole provides competition. 
Within the for-profit career-oriented and technical school sector, some of our national and regional competitors are Lincoln Technical Institute and Tulsa Welding School. We also consider other single location institutions with a larger local presence near one of our campuses to be competitors. Competition is generally based on location, tuition rates, the type of programs offered, the quality of instruction and instructional facilities, graduate employment rates, reputation and recruiting. Additionally, the military often recruits or retains potential students when branches of the military offer enlistment or re-enlistment bonuses. 
Human Capital Management 
As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 1,950 full-time employees, including approximately 650 instructors, 350 admissions representatives, and 600 student support employees.
Each of our employees plays a key role in our mission to serve students, partners and communities by providing quality education and training for in-demand careers. We believe that diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DE&I”) among our employees is essential in this process, as a truly innovative educational institution relies on a wealth of backgrounds and experiences to enhance student outcomes. We have a Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion who is responsible for setting the DE&I strategy and roadmap to ensure that we meet our objectives both internally, of creating a company where everyone feels they belong, and externally, by working closely with our marketing and talent acquisition function to attract diverse talent. To attract a truly diverse workforce, we strive to instill a culture where employees are encouraged to draw upon their own unique skills and perspectives when engaging with our growing and diverse student population. 
Faculty members are hired nationally in accordance with established criteria, applicable accreditation standards and applicable state regulations. Members of our faculty are primarily industry professionals and are hired based on their prior work and educational experience. We require a specific level of industry experience in order to enhance the quality of the programs we offer and to address current and industry-specific issues in our course content. We provide intensive instructional training and continuing education to our faculty members to maintain the quality of instruction in all fields of study. A majority of our existing instructors have a minimum of five years’ experience in the industry and an average of seven years of experience teaching at UTI. 
We employ field, military and campus-based admissions representatives who work directly with prospective students to facilitate the enrollment process. Additionally, each school has a support team that typically includes a campus president, an education director, a financial aid director, a student services director, and an career services director. 
We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively implement our growth and diversification strategy and continue to drive positive educational and employment outcomes for our students. For discussion of the risks relating to the attraction and retention of management and executive management employees, see Item 1A. “ Risk Factors.”
Environmental Matters
We use hazardous materials at our training facilities and campuses and generate small quantities of regulated waste, including, but not limited to, used oil, antifreeze, transmission fluid, paint, solvents, car batteries and aircraft batteries. As a result, our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, the use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste, and the clean-up of contamination at our 

facilities or off-site locations to which we send or have sent waste for disposal. Certain of our campuses are required to obtain permits for our air emissions. In the event we do not maintain compliance with any of these laws and regulations, or if we are responsible for a spill or release of hazardous materials, we could incur significant costs for clean-up, damages, and fines or penalties.
Regulatory Environment 
Our institutions are subject to extensive regulatory requirements imposed by a wide range of federal and state agencies, as well as by institutional and programmatic accreditors. These regulatory requirements cover the vast majority of our operations, including our educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations and financial condition. These regulatory requirements also affect our ability to acquire, expand or open additional institutions or campuses, to revise or expand our educational programs, and to change our corporate structure and ownership.
The approvals granted by these entities permit our schools to operate and to participate in a variety of government-sponsored financial aid programs that assist students in paying for their education. The most significant of these is the federal student aid programs administered by the ED pursuant to HEA Title IV Programs. Generally, to participate in Title IV Programs, an institution must be licensed or otherwise legally authorized to operate in the state where it is physically located, be accredited by an accreditor recognized by ED, be certified as an eligible institution by ED, offer at least one eligible program of education, and comply with other statutory and regulatory requirements. 
We also are subject to oversight by other federal agencies including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Internal Revenue Service and the Departments of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Defense (“DOD”), Treasury, Labor, and Justice. Below, we discuss certain elements of this regulatory environment.
State Authorization
To operate and offer postsecondary programs, and to be certified to participate in Title IV Programs, each of our institutions must obtain and maintain authorization from the state in which it is physically located (“Home State”). To engage in educational or recruiting activities outside of its Home State, each institution also may be required to obtain and maintain authorization from the states in which it is educating or recruiting students. The level of regulatory oversight varies substantially from state to state and is extensive in some states. State laws may establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, location and nature of facilities and equipment, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, student outcomes reporting, disclosure obligations to students, limitations on mandatory arbitration clauses in enrollment agreements, financial operations, and other operational matters. Some states prescribe standards of financial responsibility and mandate that institutions post surety bonds. Many states have requirements for institutions to disclose institutional data to current and prospective students, as well as to the public, and some states require that our schools meet prescribed performance standards as a condition of continued approval. States can and often do revisit, revise, and expand their regulations governing postsecondary education and recruiting.
Our institutions are also authorized to participate in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (“SARA”). SARA is an agreement among member states, districts and territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of post-secondary distance education courses and programs. SARA is overseen by a national council (“NC-SARA”) and administered by four regional education compacts. As of September 2022, 49 states (all but California), the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have joined SARA. Each of our institutions holds the state and/or SARA authorizations required to operate and offer postsecondary education programs, and to recruit in the states in which it engages in recruiting activities.
Accreditation
Accreditation is a non-governmental process through which an institution voluntarily submits to ongoing qualitative reviews by an organization of peer institutions. Institutional accreditation by an ED-recognized accreditor is required for an institution to be certified to participate in Title IV Programs. All of our institutions are accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (“ACCSC”), which is an accrediting agency recognized by ED. 

ACCSC reviews the academic quality of each institution’s instructional programs, as well as the administrative and financial operations of the institution to ensure that it has the resources necessary to perform its educational mission, implement continuous improvement processes, and support student success. Our institutions must submit annual reports, and at times, supplemental reports, to demonstrate ongoing compliance and improvement. ACCSC requires institutions to disclose certain institutional information to current and prospective students, as well as to the public, and requires that our schools and programs meet various performance standards as a condition of continued accreditation. ACCSC often revisits, revises, and expands its standards and policies. Institutions must periodically renew their accreditation by completing a comprehensive renewal of accreditation process. 
We strive to maintain the highest standards. Currently 13 of our campuses are classified as ACCSC Schools of Excellence or ACCSC Schools of Distinction. Six of our campuses have achieved this award twice in their history, and one campus has received this award three times in its history. 
The table below sets out the renewal cycle for each of our schools:

Title IV Programs
The federal government provides a substantial part of its support for postsecondary education through Title IV Programs in the form of grants and loans to students who can use those funds at any institution that has been certified as eligible to participate by ED. All of our institutions are certified to participate in Title IV Programs. The HEA, which authorizes Title IV Programs, has not been comprehensively reauthorized since 2008. Despite repeated attempts, Congress has not completed a full reauthorization since then. In addition to HEA reauthorization, policies directly related to Title IV Programs and funding for those programs may be impacted by the annual budget and appropriations process as well as by other legislation. At this 

time, we cannot predict all or any of the changes that Congress may ultimately make, and any of those changes could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. 
In fiscal year 2022, we derived approximately 67% of our revenues, on a cash basis as defined by ED, from Title IV Programs. We derived approximately 49% of our revenues, on a cash basis, from the Direct Loan program, pursuant to which ED makes loans to students or their parents. We derived approximately 18% of our revenues, on a cash basis, from the Pell program, pursuant to which ED makes grants to students who demonstrate financial need. And we derived less than 1% of our revenues, on a cash basis, from the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (“FSEOG”) program. FSEOG grants are designed to supplement Pell grants for students with the greatest financial need. Institutions must provide matching funding equal to 25% of all awards made under this program. 
The Title IV Program statutes and regulations are applied primarily on an institutional basis. The HEA defines an “institution” as a main campus and its additional locations. Pursuant to this definition, ED recognizes UTI as owning and operating four institutions (“OPE IDs”), organized as follows:

Institution: | Universal Technical Institute of Arizona 
Main campus: | Universal Technical Institute, Avondale, Arizona 
Additional campuses: | Universal Technical Institute, Lisle, Illinois 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Long Beach, California 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Miramar, Florida 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Rancho Cucamonga, California 
 | NASCAR Technical Institute, Mooresville, North Carolina 
Institution: | Universal Technical Institute of Phoenix 
Main campus: | Universal Technical Institute DBA Motorcycle Mechanics Institute, Motorcycle & Marine Mechanics Institute, Avondale, Arizona
Additional campuses: | Universal Technical Institute, Sacramento, California 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Orlando, Florida for the following divisions: 
 | Motorcycle Mechanics Institute, Orlando, Florida 
 | Marine Mechanics Institute, Orlando, Florida 
 | Automotive, Orlando, Florida 
Institution: | Universal Technical Institute of Texas 
Main campus: | Universal Technical Institute, Houston, Texas 
Additional campuses: | Universal Technical Institute, Exton, Pennsylvania 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Bloomfield, New Jersey 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Austin, Texas 
Institution: | MIAT College of Technology 
Main campus: | MIAT College of Technology, Canton, Michigan 
Additional campuses: | MIAT College of Technology, Houston, Texas 

Generally, to participate in Title IV Programs, an institution must be licensed or otherwise legally authorized to operate in the state where it is physically located, be accredited by an accreditor recognized by ED, be certified as an eligible institution by ED, offer at least one eligible program of education, and comply with other statutory and regulatory requirements. To obtain and maintain certification, institutions also must demonstrate ongoing compliance with the HEA and its extensive and complex implementing regulations; regulations that ED frequently revisits, revises, and expands. Because all of our institutions are certified to participate in Title IV Programs, they must all comply with this complex framework of statutes, 

regulations, and guidance, and undergo detailed oversight and review. Below, we discuss the core components of the Title IV Programs’ regulatory framework. 
Eligibility and Recertification
All institutions participating in the Title IV Programs must first establish their eligibility to do so. The Program Participation Agreement (“PPA”) document serves as ED’s formal recognition that an institution and its associated additional locations have satisfied this requirement, and are authorized to participate in Title IV Programs for a specified period of time. An institution seeking to expand its activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location or raising the highest academic credential it offers, must obtain approval from ED. Every institution is also required to periodically renew its certification by applying for continued certification before its current term of certification expires. Terms of certification are typically six years, but can be three years or shorter. We received fully recertified PPAs for Universal Technical Institute of Texas, Universal Technical Institute of Arizona and Universal Technical Institute of Phoenix in June 2022, which will expire June 30, 2024. 
The 90/10 Rule
As a condition of participation in Title IV Programs, proprietary institutions must agree when they sign their PPA to comply with the 90/10 rule. Under the current 90/10 rule, to remain eligible to participate in the federal student aid programs, a proprietary institution cannot derive more than 90% of its revenues for each fiscal year from Title IV Program funds. A proprietary institution is subject to sanctions if it exceeds the 90% level for a single year, and loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs if it derives more than 90% of its revenue from Title IV Programs, as applicable, for two consecutive fiscal years. 
In 2021, President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”), which amended the 90/10 rule. Section 2013 of the ARPA amended the rule to require covered institutions to derive at least 10% of their revenue from sources other than “Federal education assistance funds.” The phrase “Federal education assistance funds” was broadly defined as “federal funds that are disbursed or delivered to or on behalf of a student to be used to attend such institution.” Congress directed ED to clarify the impact of this change with new regulations. ED published a new proposed 90/10 rule on July 28, 2022 and a final rule on October 28, 2022. This rule takes effect July 1, 2023 and applies to any annual audit submission for a proprietary institutional fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2023.
Significantly, pursuant to this proposed rule, “Federal education assistance funds” would include most educational assistance funds provided by a Federal agency to an institution or a student to cover tuition, fees and other institutional charges, including funds provided by the VA or DOD. 
We regularly monitor compliance with the 90/10 requirement to minimize the risk that any of our institutions would derive more than the allowable maximum percentage of its revenue from Title IV Programs for any fiscal year. As of September 30, 2022, our institutions’ annual Title IV percentages as calculated under the current 90/10 rule ranged from approximately 64% to 70% between our institution’s four OPE IDs. Based on our review of the final 90/10 rule, including the scope of the phrase “Federal education assistance funds” we do not believe our ability to comply with 90/10 requirements will be materially impacted once the new rule takes effect. 
Administrative Capability
To continue its participation in Title IV Programs, an institution must demonstrate that it remains administratively capable of providing the education it promises and of properly managing the Title IV Programs. ED assesses the administrative capability of each institution that participates in Title IV Programs under a series of standards listed in the regulations, which cover a wide range of operational and administrative topics, including the designation of capable and qualified individuals, the quality and scope of written procedures, the adequacy of institutional communication and processes, the timely resolution of issues, the sufficiency of recordkeeping, and the frequency of findings of noncompliance, to name a few. ED’s administrative capability standards also include thresholds and expectations for federal student loan cohort default rates (discussed below), satisfactory academic progress, and loan counseling. Failure to satisfy any of the standards may lead ED to find the institution ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs, require the institution to repay Title IV Program funds, change the method of payment of Title IV Program funds, place the institution on provisional certification as a condition of its continued participation or take other actions against the institution. 
Three-Year Student Loan Default Rates
To remain eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, institutions also must maintain federal student loan cohort default rates below specified levels. ED calculates an institution’s cohort default rate on an annual basis. Under the current calculation, the cohort default rate is derived from student borrowers who first enter loan repayment during a federal fiscal year (“FFY”) ending September 30 and subsequently default on those loans within the two following years; parent borrowers are excluded from the calculation. This represents a three-year measuring period. 
The following tables set forth the most recent three-year cohort default rates for our institutions: 

 | Three-Year Cohort Default Rates for 
 | Cohort Years Ended September 30, (1)
Institution: | 2019(2) | 2018 | 2017 
Universal Technical Institute of Arizona | 3.1% | 11.9% | 13.8%
Universal Technical Institute of Phoenix | 3.7% | 11.9% | 14.0%
Universal Technical Institute of Texas | 2.7% | 12.1% | 16.1%
MIAT College of Technology(3) | 1.9% | 15.4% | 21.8%
All proprietary postsecondary institutions (4) | 3.1% | 11.2% | 14.7%

(1) Based on information published by ED.
(2)    Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ED paused all loan payments from March 13, 2020 through December 31, 2022. This has significantly decreased the default rates starting with the 2019 Cohort. 
(3) We completed the acquisition of MIAT on November 1, 2021. As a result, the cohort default rates presented here relate to periods prior to our ownership. However, since these rates affect our current collection timing on disbursements of federal student loans, we have included the rates within the table. 
(4) Includes other proprietary institutions beyond UTI. 
An institution whose cohort default rate exceeds 30% in consecutive fiscal years may be subject to conditions and restrictions, and will lose eligibility if the rate remains above 30% three years in a row. An institution also will lose eligibility if its rate exceeds 40% for any fiscal year. As demonstrated in the table above, none of our institutions had a three-year cohort default rate of 30% or greater for 2019, 2018 or 2017, for the three most recent FFYs with published rates. An institution whose three-year cohort default rate is 15% or greater for any one of the three preceding years is subject to a 30-day delay in receiving the first disbursement on federal student loans for first-time borrowers. As of September 30, 2022, Universal Technical Institute of Texas and MIAT College of Technology were subject to a 30-day delay in receiving the first disbursement on federal student loans for first-time borrowers due to a three-year cohort default rate that was 15% or greater for one of the three most recent years. 
Financial Responsibility
All institutions participating in Title IV Programs also must satisfy specific ED standards of financial responsibility. Among other things, an institution must meet all of its financial obligations, including required refunds to students and any Title IV Program liabilities and debts, be current in its debt payments, comply with certain past performance requirements, and not receive an adverse, qualified, or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited financial statements. Each year, ED also evaluates institutions’ financial responsibility by calculating a “composite score,” which utilizes information provided in the institutions’ annual audited financial statements. The composite score is based on three ratios: (1) the equity ratio which measures the institution’s capital resources, ability to borrow and financial viability; (2) the primary reserve ratio which measures the institution’s ability to support current operations from expendable resources; and (3) the net income ratio which measures the institution’s ability to operate at a profit.
ED assigns a strength factor to the results of each of these ratios on a scale from negative 1.0 to positive 3.0, with negative 1.0 reflecting financial weakness and positive 3.0 reflecting financial strength. ED then assigns a weighting percentage to each ratio and adds the weighted scores for the three ratios together to produce a composite score for the institution. If an institution’s composite score is above 1.5, and it meets all other requirements, it is deemed financially responsible. If its 

composite score is below 1.5, but at least 1.0, the institution is still considered to be financially responsible, but must agree to additional oversight by ED in the form of cash monitoring and other participation requirements. 
If an institution’s composite score is below 1.0, the institution is considered by ED to lack financial responsibility. ED may permit the institution to continue to participate in the Title IV Programs if it agrees to, among other things: (1) post a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 50% of the total Title IV Program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year; or (2) post a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 10% of such prior year’s Title IV Program funds, accept provisional certification for a period of no more than three years, comply with additional ED notification and operating requirements and conditions, and agree to receive Title IV Program funds under an arrangement other than ED’s standard advance funding arrangement. If an institution is unable to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis, the institution may be subject to financial penalties, restrictions on operations and loss of external financial aid funding. 
ED has historically evaluated the financial condition of our institutions on a consolidated basis based on the financial statements of Universal Technical Institute, Inc. as the parent company. ED’s regulations permit ED to examine the financial statements of Universal Technical Institute, Inc., the financial statements of each institution and the financial statements of any related party. ED has not required us currently to post a letter of credit on behalf of any of our schools. ED has required us to provide certain information on a regular basis following our issuance of preferred stock on July 15, 2016, and we continue to provide monthly reports to ED pursuant to such direction. For our year ended September 30, 2022, we calculated our composite score to be 2.3. However, the composite score calculations and resulting requirements imposed on our institutions are subject to determination by ED once it receives and reviews our audited financial statements. 
Between composite score calculations, ED also will reevaluate the financial responsibility of an institution following the occurrence of certain “triggering events,” which must be timely reported to the agency. Specifically, ED may determine that an institution is not able to meet its financial or administrative obligations if one of the following events occurs:
•The institution incurs a liability from a settlement, final judgment or final determination arising from an administrative or judicial action or proceeding initiated by a federal or state entity and, as a result of that liability, the institution’s recalculated composite score is less than 1.0 as determined by ED under procedures described in the regulations;
•For a proprietary institution whose composite score is less than 1.5, there is a withdrawal of owner’s equity from the institution by any means (as defined by the regulations) and, as a result of that withdrawal, the institution’s recalculated composite score is less than 1.0 as determined by ED under procedures described in the regulations; 
•The SEC issues an order suspending or revoking the registration of the institution’s securities or suspends trading of the institution’s securities on any national securities exchange; 
•The national securities exchange on which the institution’s securities are traded notifies the institution that it is not in compliance with the exchange’s listing requirements and, as a result, the institution’s securities are delisted;
•The SEC is not in timely receipt of a required report and did not issue an extension to file the report; or 
•If two or more “discretionary” triggering events (as described below) take place within a certain time period unless a triggering event is resolved before any subsequent event(s) occurs.
ED may also determine that an institution is not able to meet its financial or administrative obligations if one of the following discretionary triggering events occurs and is likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the institution:
•The accrediting agency for the institution issued an order, such as a show cause order or similar action, that, if not satisfied, could result in the withdrawal, revocation or suspension of institutional accreditation; 
•The institution violated a provision or requirement in a security or loan agreement and a default, delinquency or other event occurs that triggers or enables the creditor to require or impose on the institution an increase in collateral, a change in contractual obligations, an increase in interest rates or payments, or other sanctions, penalties, or fees; 

•The institution’s state licensing agency notifies the institution of an intent to withdraw or terminate the institution’s state licensure if the institution does not take the steps necessary to come into compliance with a state licensing agency requirement; 
•The institution did not receive at least 10% of its revenue in compliance with the 90/10 rule for its most recently completed fiscal year as calculated by ED; 
•The institution has high annual drop-out rates as calculated by ED; or 
•The institution’s two most recent official cohort default rates are 30% or greater, as determined under the regulations and unless the institution has a pending or successful appeal that sufficiently reduces at least one of the rates.
ED regulations give the institution an opportunity to provide information to the agency demonstrating that the triggering event is not material to the institution’s financial position in advance of any final determination regarding the institution’s financially responsibility. 
Substantial Misrepresentation
The regulatory definitions of “misrepresentation” and “substantial misrepresentation” enforced by ED are exceptionally broad and do not require intent by the institution to misrepresent, or actual reliance by the person to whom the alleged misrepresentation was made. Therefore, it is possible that a statement made by the institution or one of its service providers or representatives could be construed by ED to constitute a substantial misrepresentation, even if the statement was made in error, without intent to misrepresent, and the person to whom it was made did not actually rely upon it. 
Incentive Compensation
The “incentive compensation” prohibition forbids institutions from providing any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, on success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the awarding of Title IV Program funds. We have made adjustments to the compensation practices for our admissions representatives which we believe comply with the current regulations and ED’s guidance. We will continue to evaluate other compensation options under these regulations and guidance. 
Distance Education
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ED provided broad approval for institutions to use distance education without going through the standard ED approval process. ED also permitted accreditors to waive their distance education review requirements. Taking advantage of these flexibilities, we transitioned our students into blended program formats, which permitted their non-clinical training to be offered online. 
ED’s temporary flexibilities currently remain in place, and will continue through the end of the payment period that begins after the date on which the federally-declared national emergency related to COVID-19 is rescinded. However, having observed that our blended learning programs offer a range of academic, operational, and financial efficiencies, we have determined to seek the permanent approvals that will permit us to continue offering blended learning programming after the noted temporary flexibilities have expired. We also continue to work to ensure that our blended learning programming complies with applicable distance education rules and standards, including ED’s new distance education rules, which became effective July 1, 2021. We intend to offer our Automotive, Diesel, Automotive/Diesel, Motorcycle and Marine programs in a blended learning format on a permanent basis. Additionally, we intend to continue to invest in our blended learning platform and curriculum to further enhance the student experience and student outcomes. 
To date, we have received approval from ACCSC to permanently offer blended format programs that utilize both distance
and on-ground education. Additionally, we have received permanent approvals from all state education authorizing agencies
to offer blended format programs. 
Title IV Program Rulemaking
ED is almost continuously engaged in one or more negotiated rulemakings, which is the process pursuant to which the agency revisits, revises, and expands the complex and voluminous Title IV Program regulations. Currently, ED is conducting two significant, negotiated rulemaking efforts to revise rules concerning 16 different issue areas.

Between October and December of 2021, the Affordability and Student Loans committee negotiated new rules relating to nine issue areas: (1) borrower defense to repayment, (2) closed school loan discharges, (3) total and permanent disability discharges, (4) false certification discharges, (5) income-driven loan repayment plans, (6) interest capitalization on Federal student loans, (7) pre-dispute arbitration and class action waiver clauses, (8) Pell Grants for prison education programs, and (9) Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Shortly thereafter, between January and March 2022, the Institutional and Programmatic Eligibility committee considered new rules relating to seven issue areas: (1) the 90/10 rule, (2) ability to benefit, (3) certification procedures for participation in Title IV Programs, (4) change of ownership and control, (5) financial responsibility, (6) gainful employment, and (7) standards of administrative capability. 
On October 28, 2022, ED published a final rule amending regulations governing Pell Grants for prison education programs, the 90/10 rule, and changes in ownership and control, effective July 1, 2023. On November 1, 2022, ED published a final rule governing borrower defense to repayment rule, closed school loan discharges, pre-dispute arbitration and class action waiver clauses, interest capitalization on Federal student loans, Public Student Loan Forgiveness, total and permanent disability discharges, and false certification discharges, also effective July 1, 2023. The regulated community is awaiting proposed rules on the remaining topics covered by ED’s negotiated rulemakings. We devote significant effort to understanding the effects of ED regulations and rulemakings on our business and to developing compliant solutions that also are congruent with our business, culture, and mission to serve our students and industry relationships. 
ED Non-Discrimination Rulemakings
As a condition of receiving federal financial assistance, we are responsible for complying with applicable laws and regulations promulgated by ED regarding non-discrimination. On July 12, 2022, ED published a proposed rule to amend the regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”). This proposed rule represents a significant revision of the current rules. ED also has indicated that it will be proposing a rule to amend regulations related to nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in the Spring of 2023. We devote significant effort to complying with non-discrimination laws and regulations. We are monitoring all proposed non-discrimination rules and will carefully review any proposed or final regulations promulgated by ED.
Department of Veterans Affairs Benefit Programs
Some of our students receive financial aid from VA benefit programs. In 2022, we derived approximately 13% of our revenues, on a cash basis, from veterans’ benefits programs, which include the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the Montgomery GI Bill, the Reserve Education Assistance Program (“REAP”) and VA Vocational Rehabilitation. To continue participation in veterans’ benefits programs, an institution must comply with certain requirements established by the VA, including that the institution report on the enrollment status of eligible students; maintain student records and make such records available for inspection; follow rules applicable to the individual benefits programs; and comply with applicable limits on the percentage of students receiving certain veterans’ benefits on a program and campus basis.
The VA shares responsibility for VA benefit approval and oversight with designated State Approving Agencies (“SAAs”). SAAs play a critical role in evaluating institutions and their programs to determine if they meet VA benefit eligibility requirements. Processes and approval criteria, as well as interpretation of applicable requirements, can vary from state to state. Therefore, approval in one state does not necessarily result in approval in all states. 
The VA imposes limitations on the percentage of students per program receiving benefits under certain veterans’ benefits programs, unless the program qualifies for certain exemptions. This rule, the 85/15 Rule, prohibits paying VA benefits to students enrolling in a program when more than 85% of the students enrolled in that program are having any portion of their tuition, fees, or other charges paid for them by the school or VA. If the ratio of supported students to non-supported students exceeds 85% at the time a new VA student enters or reenters (such as after a break in enrollment), the student cannot be certified to receive benefits in the program.
If the VA determines that a program is out of compliance with these limitations, the VA will continue to provide benefits to current students, but new students will not be eligible to use their veterans’ benefits for an affected program until we demonstrate compliance. Additionally, the VA requires a campus be in operation for two years before it can apply to participate in VA benefit programs. With the exception of our two newest campuses in Austin, Texas and Miramar, Florida which opened between May and August 2022, all of our campuses are eligible to participate in VA education benefit programs.

In 2012, President Obama signed an Executive Order directing the DOD, VA and ED to establish “Principles of Excellence” (“Principles”), based on certain guidelines set forth in the Executive Order, to apply to educational institutions receiving federal funding for service members, veterans and family members. As requested, we provided written confirmation of our intent to comply with the Principles to the VA in June 2012. We are required to comply with the Principles to continue recruitment activities on military installations. Additionally, there is a requirement to possess a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with the DOD as well as with certain individual installations. Our access to bases for student recruitment has become more limited due to recent changes in the Transition Assistance Program (Transition Goals, Plans, Success) and increased enforcement of the MOU requirement. Each of our institutions has an MOU with the DOD. We have MOUs with certain key individual installations and are pursuing MOUs at additional locations; however, some installations will not provide MOUs to institutions that do not teach at the installation. We continue to strengthen and develop relationships with our existing contacts and with new contacts in order to maintain and rebuild our access to military installations. 
Other Federal and State Student Aid Programs
Some of our students receive financial aid from federal sources other than Title IV or VA Programs, such as from the DOD or under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. Additionally, some states provide financial aid to our students in the form of grants, loans or scholarships. Our Long Beach, Rancho Cucamonga and Sacramento, California campuses, for example, are currently eligible to participate in the Cal Grant program. All of our institutions must comply with the eligibility and participation requirements applicable to each of these funding programs, which vary by funding agency and program.
Consumer Protections Laws and Regulations
As a postsecondary educational institution, we are subject to a broad range of consumer protection and other laws, such as recruiting, marketing, the protection of personal information, student financing and payment servicing, enforced by federal agencies such as the FTC and CFPB and various state agencies and state attorneys general. We devote significant effort to complying with state and federal consumer protection laws. 
We received a January 18, 2022 letter from the CFPB explaining that it was assessing whether UTI “is subject to the CFPB’s supervisory authority based on its activities related to student lending.” The CFPB’s letter then requested certain information about extensions of credit to our students; generally explained the source and scope of the CFPB’s regulatory authority; and advised that, after it reviewed the requested materials, the CFPB “anticipates providing guidance regarding whether UTI is subject to CFPB’s supervisory authority.” We have provided the requested information and are awaiting further guidance, if any, from the CFPB.
We, along with 69 other proprietary institutions, received an October 6, 2021 letter from the FTC providing notice that engaging in deceptive or unfair conduct in the education marketplace violates consumer protection laws and could lead to significant civil penalties. The notice stated that an institutions receipt of the letter “does not reflect any assessment as to whether they have engaged in deceptive or unfair conduct,” and the FTC did not request any information.
Federal Student Loan Forgiveness
On August 24, 2022, the Biden administration announced a student loan relief plan. Under this plan, the Department will provide up to $20,000 in debt relief to Pell Grant recipients with loans held by the Department and up to $10,000 in debt relief to non-Pell Grant recipients. Borrowers are eligible for this relief if their individual income is less than $125,000 or $250,000 for households. The plan is currently subject to a number of legal challenges in court. Should the plan survive judicial scrutiny, we expect many of our alumni and a portion of our current students as of this filing, would qualify for and take advantage of this relief.
