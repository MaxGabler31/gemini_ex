 Overview/Corporate History 
 CytoDyn Inc. was originally incorporated under the laws of Colorado on May 2, 2002 under the name RexRay Corporation (our previous name). Effective August 27, 2015, we completed a reincorporation from Colorado to Delaware. Our principal business office is 1111 Main Street, Suite 660, Vancouver, Washington 98660. Our website can be found at www.cytodyn.com. We will make available on our website, free of charge, the proxy statements and reports on Forms 8-K, 10-K, and 10-Q that we file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as soon as reasonably practicable, after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to, the SEC. The SEC also maintains a website that contains our SEC filings. The address of the site is www.sec.gov. Further, a copy of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is located at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room can be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.We do not intend to incorporate any contents from our website into this annual report. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this prospectus to CytoDyn, the Company, we, our, or us are to CytoDyn Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the clinical development and potential commercialization of humanized monoclonal antibodies to treat HIV infection. Our lead product candidate, PRO 140, belongs to a class of HIV therapies known as entry inhibitors that block HIV from entering into and infecting certain cells. We believe that monoclonal antibodies are a new emerging class of therapeutics for the treatment of HIV to address unmet medical needs in the area of HIV and other immunologic indications, such as Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) and certain types of cancer. As we progress in evaluating PRO 140 in different pathways of human disease and inflammation, we are encouraged by the opportunity to build a broad pipeline of indications.

The preclinical and clinical development of PRO 140 was led by Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Progenics) through 2011. We acquired the asset from Progenics in October 2012, as described in PRO 140 Acquisition and Licensing Arrangements below, and have recently advanced PRO 140 through achieving primary endpoint in a Phase 2b/3 pivotal trial for HIV combination therapy and are progressing forward with the preparation and filing of a biologics license application. 
 PRO 140 
 We believe the PRO 140 antibody shows promise as a powerful anti-viral agent with the advantage of fewer side effects, lower toxicity and less frequent dosing requirements, as compared to daily drug therapies currently in use for the treatment of HIV. The PRO 140 antibody belongs to a class of HIV therapies known as entry inhibitors that block HIV from entering into and infecting certain cells. PRO 140 blocks HIV from entering a cell by binding to a molecule called the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), a normal cell surface receptor protein to which certain strains of HIV, referred to as R5 strains, attach as part of HIVs entry into a cell. 
 PRO 140 does not affect the normal function of the CCR5 co-receptor for HIV. Instead, PRO 140 binds to a precise site on CCR5 that R5 strains of HIV use to enter the cell and, in doing so, inhibits the ability of these strains of HIV to infect the cell without affecting the cells normal function. The R5 strains of HIV currently represent approximately 67% of all HIV infections in the U.S. As a result, we believe PRO 140 represents a distinct class of CCR5 inhibitors with advantageous virological and immunological properties and may provide a unique tool to treat HIV infected patients. 
 We believe PRO 140 is uniquely positioned to address a growing HIV market, as an alternative, or in addition to current therapies, which are failing primarily due to compliance, which causes drug resistance. There are several factors giving rise to compliance issues, such as, toxicity and side effects, coupled with the need for a strict regimen of daily dosing. In seven clinical trials previously conducted, PRO 140 was generally well tolerated, and no drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs), or dose-proportional adverse events (AEs), were reported. In addition, there were no dose-limiting toxicities or patterns of drug-related toxicities observed during these trials. The results of these studies established that PRO 140s antiviral activity was potent, rapid, prolonged, dose-dependent, and statistically significant following a single dose. Because PRO 140s mechanism of action (for a monoclonal antibody use in HIV) is a relatively new therapeutic approach, it provides a very useful method of suppressing the virus in treatment-experienced patients who have failed a prior HIV regimen and need new treatment options. PRO 140, as a single agent therapy, has also demonstrated that it could replace highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) altogether for a subpopulation of R5 patients who have suppressed viral load with HAART, but are seeking an alternative treatment that allows the patient an improved quality of life, with the advantages of fewer side effects, lower toxicity and less frequent dosing requirements. 
 To date, PRO 140 has been tested and administered to patients either intravenously or as a subcutaneous injection. We believe that, if PRO 140 is approved for use as an injectable by the FDA, it may nonetheless be an attractive and marketable therapeutic option for patients, particularly in the following scenarios: 
 

 | Patients desiring a break from existing treatment regimens, whether due to side-effects or for any personal reasons;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Patients with difficulty adhering to daily drug regimens;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | Patients who poorly tolerate existing therapies;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | Patients with compromised organ function, such as hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Patients with complex concomitant medical requirements; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


 | Patients who choose not to start their HAART regimen immediately after being infected with HIV.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe PRO 140 has demonstrated potent (as compared to existing treatments) antiretroviral activity and an encouraging safety profile in prior clinical testing, that PRO 140 has the potential to be the first long-acting (weekly or every other week), self-administered HIV therapy, and that PRO 140 inhibits CCR5-tropic HIV while preserving CCR5s natural function. We believe PRO 140 represents a distinct class of CCR5 inhibitors with unique virological and immunological properties and may provide another distinct tool to treat HIV-infected patients. 
 Our ongoing HIV-related clinical trials, described in greater detail below, have been designed to demonstrate the proof of concept that PRO 140 monotherapy can continue to suppress the viral load in certain HIV-infected, treatment-experienced patients who had suppressed viral load on HAART, but would like an alternative treatment that provides a higher quality of life with one dose a week through a self-injection. Once the viral load is undetectable, weekly administration of PRO 140 can help maintain the suppressed viral load in a subpopulation of R5 patients over an extended period of time (currently shown to be approaching four years). Based on the preliminary results of such studies, we believe that a PRO 140 treatment option could also address the unmet medical need for therapy options for certain HIV-infected patients with uncontrolled viral load, despite conventional HAART treatments.

To facilitate our self-funded and sponsored clinical research plans and trials, we engaged Amarex Clinical Research, LLC (Amarex), as our principal contract research organization (CRO), to provide comprehensive clinical trial management services. 
 Proposed ProstaGene Transaction 
 On July 12, 2018, we announced a strategic expansion of our clinical focus to include the evaluation of PRO 140 in certain cancer and immunological indications where CCR5 antagonism has shown initial promise. In connection with this expansion, we signed a non-binding letter of intent regarding a proposed acquisition of intellectual property and other assets of ProstaGene LLC (ProstaGene), a privately held company focused on prostate cancer diagnostics and therapeutics aimed at blocking cancer metastasis by blocking CCR5. At the same time, we remain committed to advancing our clinical programs with PRO 140 in HIV and GvHD, and is continuing with our previously announced plans to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) for PRO 140 as a combination therapy for HIV. 
 As part of the proposed transaction with ProstaGene, Richard G. Pestell, M.D., Ph.D., M.B.A., F.A.C.P., F.R.A.C.P., the Chief Executive Officer of ProstaGene and President of the Pennsylvania Cancer and Regenerative Medicine Research Center, will join as our Chief Medical Officer. It is also expected that Dr. Pestell will join our Board of Directors at the closing of the transaction. The transaction is subject to completion of due diligence review, customary definitive documentation, deal structure and requisite corporate and regulatory approvals. The final terms of the transaction will be available upon the execution of definitive documentation. 
 Current Clinical Trials 
 PRO 140 is currently being studied in four clinical trials: 
 

 | Our first ongoing clinical trial is an extension study of our Phase 2b treatment substitution trial, which was initially completed in January 2015. There are a total of six patients in this extension study and each has surpassed three and one-half years of suppressed viral load with PRO 140 as a single agent therapy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our second ongoing clinical trial is a pivotal Phase 2b/3 trial for PRO 140 as a combination therapy to existing HAART drug regimens. This trial was a double blind placebo controlled trial. In late February 2018, the Company reported that it had enrolled 52 patients and the trials primary endpoint was achieved with a p-value of 0.0032. The primary endpoint for efficacy was defined as 0.5log of viral load drop after one week of therapy with PRO 140 in combination with the patients failing HAART regimen. Patients for the safety analysis in a Biologics License Application will be provided by all of our HIV trials, providing that those patients have been on a PRO 140 therapy for 24 weeks, with the same or higher dose as the combination therapy trial.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The third ongoing trial is an investigative Phase 2b/3 trial including 300 patients to assess the treatment strategy of using PRO 140 subcutaneously as a long-acting single-agent maintenance therapy. This is a 48-week trial in patients with suppressed viral load with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection. The primary endpoint is the number of patients who can maintain suppressed viral load under a PRO 140 monotherapy replacing their HAART regimen for 48 weeks. The secondary endpoint is the number of weeks a patient is off of their ART regimen. The Company is currently exploring a higher dose arm (525 mg), which is a 50% increase from the original dosage (350 mg), as well as a 700mg dose. The Company believes that the higher dose will result in a higher response rate, which is supported by preliminary data.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our fourth ongoing trial of PRO 140 is a Phase 2 study for GvHD and is the first non-HIV, immunologic indication for PRO 140. This trial is designed to evaluate the feasibility of the use of PRO 140 as an add-on therapy to standard GvHD prophylaxis treatment for prevention of acute GvHD in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HST). On October 5, 2017, we announced that the FDA had granted orphan drug designation to PRO 140 for the prevention of GvHD. In March 2018, we announced the completion of a planned interim analysis of trial data on the first 10 patients enrolled, which resulted in certain amendments to the trial protocol described in greater detail below.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We will require a significant amount of additional capital to complete the foregoing clinical trials for HIV and to prepare and file our BLA submission. See Liquidity and Capital Resources under the heading Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations below.

Phase 2b Extension Study for HIV, as Monotherapy 
 Currently, there are a total of six patients in this ongoing extension study and each has surpassed three and one-half years of suppressed viral load with PRO 140 as a single agent therapy. These patients are continuing in extension studies of this monotherapy trial by self-administering a weekly injection of PRO 140. 
 Phase 2b/3 Pivotal Trial for HIV, as Combination Therapy 
 This is a pivotal 25-week trial for PRO 140 as a combination therapy to existing HAART drug regimens. This trial was a double blind, placebo controlled trial. In late February 2018, the Company reported that it had enrolled 52 patients and the trials primary endpoint was achieved with a p-value of 0.0032. The primary endpoint for efficacy was defined as 0.5log reduction in viral load after one week of therapy with PRO 140 in combination with the patients failing HAART regimen. Following the achievement of primary endpoint, the trial is continuing to enroll under an open label for safety analysis. Nearly all patients have successfully completed this trial and most of the patients have transitioned into a FDA-cleared rollover study, in order to provide continued access to PRO 140 therapy, at the request of their treating physician. 
 Rollover Study for HIV, as Combination Therapy 
 This study is designed for patients who successfully complete the Phase 2b/3 Combination Therapy trial and for whom the treating physicians request a continuation of PRO 140 therapy in order to maintain suppressed viral load. 
 Phase 2b/3 Investigative Trial for HIV, as Long-term Monotherapy 
 This is a trial of 300 patients that assesses using PRO 140 subcutaneously as a long-acting single-agent maintenance therapy for 48 weeks in patients with suppressed viral load with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection. The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants with a suppressed viral load to those who experienced virologic failure. The secondary endpoint is length of time to virologic failure. We are currently exploring a high-dose arm with a 50% increase in dosage (525mg), as well as a 700mg dose, within the trials protocol in order to evaluate an increased response rate of all patients. Patients who are completing this trial are transitioning to a roll-over protocol, as requested by the treating physicians to enable the patients to have continued access to PRO 140 as a single-agent, self-injection maintenance therapy. The first patients were enrolled in December 2016 and enrollment is now continuing beyond 300 patients in order to evaluate the response rate of two higher dose arms. 
 Phase 2 Trial for Graft-versus-Host Disease 
 This Phase 2 multi-center 100-day study with 60 patients is designed to evaluate the feasibility of the use of PRO 140 as an add-on therapy to standard GvHD prophylaxis treatment for prevention of acute GvHD in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HST). Enrollment of the first patient was announced in May of 2017. On October 5, 2017, the Company announced that the FDA had granted orphan drug designation to PRO 140 for the prevention of GvHD. 
 In March 2018, we announced that the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) for PRO 140 Phase 2 trial in GvHD had completed a planned interim analysis of trial data on the first 10 patients enrolled. Following this review of data from the first 10 patients in the Phase 2 trial, we filed amendments to the protocol with the FDA. The amendments included switching the pre-treatment conditioning regimen from aggressive myeloablative (MA) conditioning to a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), and switching from a blinded one-for-one randomized placebo-controlled design to an open-label design under which all enrollees receive PRO 140. The amendments also provide for a 50% increase in the dose of PRO 140 (to 525 mg) to more closely mimic preclinical dosing. The next review of data by the IDMC will occur following enrollment of 10 patients under the amended protocol after each patient has been dosed for 30 days. 
 Immunological Applications for PRO 140 
 We are continuing to explore opportunities for clinical applications for PRO 140 involving the CCR5 receptor, other than HIV-related treatments, such as inflammatory conditions, autoimmune diseases and cancer. 
 The target of PRO 140 is the important immunologic receptor CCR5. The CCR5 receptor is more than the door for HIV to enter T-cells; it is also a crucial component in inflammatory responses. This opens the potential for multiple pipeline opportunities for PRO 140. 
 
5 
 
The CCR5 receptor is a protein located on the surface of white blood cells that serves as a receptor for chemical attractants called chemokines. Chemokines are the key orchestrators of leukocyte trafficking by attracting immune cells to the sites of inflammation. 
 At the site of an inflammatory reaction, chemokines are released. These chemokines are specific for CCR5 and cause the migration of T-cells to these sites promoting further inflammation. The mechanism of action of PRO 140 has the potential to block the movement of T-cells to inflammatory sites, which could be instrumental in diminishing or eliminating inflammatory responses. Some disease processes that could benefit from CCR5 blockade include new reactions to cancer, transplantation rejection, autoimmunity and chronic inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. 
 Due to our mechanism of action, we believe PRO 140 has significant advantages in terms of safety and reduced side effects over other CCR5 antagonists. Prior studies have demonstrated that PRO 140 does not cause direct activation of T-cells.    We have already reported encouraging human safety data for our clinical trials with PRO 140 in HIV-infected patients. 
 We have initiated our first clinical trial with PRO 140 in an immunological indication  a Phase 2 clinical trial with PRO 140 for GvHD in patients with AML or MDS who are undergoing bone marrow stem cell transplantation. GvHD represents an unmet medical need, with patients who contract GvHD during stem cell transplant having a significantly decreased 1-year survival rate with relapsed GvHD as the leading cause of death. Our pre-clinical study in GvHD has been published in the peer-reviewed journal Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation. 
 We are also expanding the clinical focus with PRO 140 to include the evaluation in certain cancer and immunological indications where CCR5 antagonism has shown initial promise. 
 Other Product Candidates 
 Except as otherwise disclosed above, until the clinical trials for PRO 140 have advanced further, we do not plan to devote any resources towards the development, research, testing, approval or commercialization of other product candidates. 
 PRO 140 Acquisition and Licensing Arrangements 
 We originally acquired PRO 140, as well as certain other related assets, including the existing inventory of PRO 140 bulk drug substance, intellectual property, and FDA regulatory filings, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 25, 2012 (the Progenics Purchase Agreement), between CytoDyn and Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Progenics). Pursuant to the Progenics Purchase Agreement, we are required to pay Progenics a remaining milestone payment and royalties as follows: (i) $5,000,000 at the time of the first U,S. new drug application approval by the FDA or other non-U.S. approval for the sale of PRO 140; and (ii) royalty payments of up to 5% on net sales during the period beginning on the date of the first commercial sale of PRO 140 until the later of (a) the expiration of the last to expire patent included in the acquired assets, and (b) 10 years, in each case determined on a country-by country basis. To the extent that such remaining milestone payment and royalties are not timely made, under the terms of the Progenics Purchase Agreement, Progenics has certain repurchase rights relating to the assets sold to us thereunder. 
 Payments to Progenics are in addition to payments due under a Development and License Agreement, dated April 30, 1999 (the PDL License), between Protein Design Labs (now AbbVie Inc.) and Progenics, which was assigned to us in the Progenics Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we have an exclusive worldwide license to develop, make, have made, import, use, sell, offer to sell or have sold products that incorporate the humanized form of the PRO 140 antibody developed under the agreement. Pursuant to the PDL License, we are required to pay AbbVie Inc. remaining milestone payments and royalties as follows: (i) $500,000 upon filing a Biologic License Application with the FDA or non-U.S. equivalent regulatory body; (ii) $500,000 upon FDA approval or approval by another non-U.S. equivalent regulatory body; and (iii) royalties of up to 7.5% of net sales for the longer of 10 years and the date of expiration of the last to expire licensed patent. Additionally, the PDL License provides for an annual maintenance fee of $150,000 until royalties paid exceed that amount. To the extent that such remaining milestone payments and royalties are not timely made, under the terms of the PDL License, AbbVie Inc. has certain termination rights relating to our license of PRO 140 thereunder. 
 Effective July 29, 2015, we entered into a License Agreement (the Lonza Agreement) with Lonza Sales AG (Lonza) covering Lonzas system know-how technology with respect to our use of proprietary cell lines to manufacture new PRO 140 material. The Lonza Agreement provides for an annual license fee and future royalty payments, both of which varies based on whether Lonza, or we or our strategic partner manufactures PRO 140. We currently use an independent party as a contract manufacturer for PRO 140. Therefore, if this arrangement continues, an annual license fee of £300,000 (approximately US$400,000 given current exchange rate) would continue to apply, as well as a royalty, up to, 2% of the net selling price upon commercialization of PRO 140, excluding value added taxes and similar amounts.

Patents, Proprietary Technology and Data Exclusivity 
 Protection of our intellectual property rights is important to our business. We may file patent applications in the U.S., Canada, China, and Japan, European countries that are party to the European Patent Convention and other countries on a selective basis in order to protect inventions we consider to be important to the development of our business. 
 Generally, patents issued in the U.S. are effective for either (i) 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date, if the application was filed on or after June 8, 1995, or (ii) the longer of 17 years from the date of issue or 20 years from the earliest asserted filing date, if the application was filed prior to that date. A U.S. patent, to be selected by us upon receipt of FDA regulatory approval, may be subject to up to a five-year patent term extension in certain instances. While the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law, most countries provide for a patent term of 20 years measured from the application filing date and some may also allow for patent term extension to compensate for regulatory approval delay. We pursue opportunities for seeking new meaningful patent protection on an ongoing basis. We currently anticipate that, absent patent term extension, patent protection relating to the PRO 140 antibody itself will start to expire in 2023, certain methods of using PRO 140 will start to expire in 2026, and certain formulations comprising PRO 140 will start to expire in 2031. 
 Patents do not enable us to preclude competitors from commercializing drugs in direct competition with our products that are not covered by granted and enforceable patent claims. Consequently, patents may not provide us with any meaningful competitive advantage. See related risk factors under the heading Risk Factors below. We may also rely on data exclusivity, trade secrets and proprietary know-how to develop and attempt to achieve a competitive position with our product candidates. We generally require our employees, consultants and partners who have access to our proprietary information to sign confidentiality agreements in an effort to protect our intellectual property. 
 Separate from and in addition to the patent rights noted above, we expect that PRO 140 will be subject to at least a 12-year data exclusivity period measured from the first date of FDA licensure, during which period no other applications referencing PRO 140 will be approved by FDA. Further, no other applications referencing PRO 140 will be accepted by FDA for a 4-year period measured from the first date of FDA licensure. Accordingly, this period of data exclusivity is expected to provide at least a 12-year term of protection against competing products shown to be biosimilar or interchangeable with PRO 140. Similar data exclusivity or data protection periods of up to about five years or more are provided in at least Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, and New Zealand. 
 We note that data exclusivity is not an extension of patent rights, and it does not prevent the introduction of generic versions of the innovative drug during the data exclusivity period, as long as the marketing approval of the generic version does not use or rely upon the innovators test data. Patents and data exclusivity are different concepts, protect different subject matter, arise from different efforts, and have different legal effects over different time periods.

 Research, development and commercialization of a biopharmaceutical product often require choosing between alternative development and optimization routes at various stages in the development process. Preferred routes depend upon currentand may be affected by subsequentdiscoveries and test results, availability of financial resources, and other factors, and cannot be identified with certainty. There are numerous third-party patents in fields in which we work, and we may need to obtain licenses under patents of others in order to pursue a preferred development route of one or more of our product candidates. The need to obtain a license would decrease the ultimate value and profitability of an affected product. If we cannot negotiate such a license, we might have to pursue a less desirable development route or terminate the program altogether. See Risk Factors below.

Government Regulation 
 Regulation of Health Care Industry 
 The health care industry is highly regulated, and state and federal health care laws and regulations are applicable to certain aspects of our business. For example, there are federal and state health care laws and regulations that apply to the operation of clinical laboratories, the business relationships between health care providers and suppliers, the privacy and security of health information and the conduct of clinical research. 
Regulation of Products 
 The design, testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products is regulated by numerous third parties, including the FDA, foreign governments, independent standards auditors and our customers. 
 In the United States, biological products have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling, import, export and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the FDA through its Center for Devices and Radiological Health and its Center for Biological Evaluation and Research continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation for FDA clearance of current and new biologic products. The FDA can ban certain biological products; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded biological products; order repair, replacement or refund of these products; and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to biological products that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain certain violations of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, or the Public Health Service Act pertaining to certain biological products or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. 
 The lengthy process of seeking drug approvals, and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Failure to comply with applicable regulations can result in refusal by the FDA to approve product license applications. The FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted product approvals. 
 Pharmaceutical products such as PRO 140 may not be commercially marketed without prior approval from the FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries. In the United States, the process for obtaining FDA approval for products like PRO 140 typically includes pre-clinical studies, the filing of an Investigational New Drug application (IND), human clinical trials and filing and approval of either a New Drug Application (NDA), for chemical pharmaceutical products, or a Biologics License Application (BLA) for biological pharmaceutical products, such as PRO 140. The results of pre-clinical testing, which include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product and its formulations, details concerning the drug manufacturing process and its controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND that must be reviewed and become effective before clinical testing can begin. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an independent institutional review board (IRB), for approval. Once a sponsor submits an IND, the sponsor must wait 30 calendar days before initiating any clinical trials, during which time the FDA has an opportunity to review the IND and raise concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials outlined in the IND. If the FDA has comments or questions, they must be resolved to the satisfaction of the FDA before clinical trials can begin. In addition, the FDA, an IRB or we may, at any time, impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Our non-clinical and clinical studies must conform to the FDAs Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), and Good Clinical Practice (GCP), requirements, which are designed to ensure the quality and integrity of submitted data and protect the rights and well-being of study patients. Information for certain clinical trials also must be publicly disclosed within certain time limits on the clinical trial registry and results databank maintained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 
 The results of the pre-clinical and clinical testing, chemistry, manufacturing and control information and proposed labeling are then submitted to the FDA in the form of either an NDA or BLA for review and potential approval to commence commercial sales. In responding to an NDA or BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information in a complete response letter, or deny the approval if it determines that the NDA or BLA does not provide an adequate basis for approval. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of an NDA or BLA and may require additional testing. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDAs satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter, which authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications, and sometimes with specified post-marketing commitments. Any approval required from the FDA might not be obtained on a timely basis, if at all.

Among the conditions for an NDA or BLA approval is the requirement that the manufacturing operations conform on an ongoing basis with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs). In complying with cGMPs, we must expend time, money and effort in the areas of training, production and quality control within our own organization and at our contract manufacturing laboratories. A successful inspection of the manufacturing facility by the FDA is a prerequisite for final approval of a biological product like PRO140. Following approval of the NDA or BLA, we and our third-party manufacturers remain subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. We also face similar inspections coordinated by the European Medicines Agency by inspectors from particular European Union (EU) member countries that conduct inspections on behalf of the EU and from other foreign regulatory authorities. Any determination by the FDA or other regulatory authorities of manufacturing or other deficiencies could materially adversely affect our business. 
 Regulatory requirements and approval processes in EU countries are similar in principle to those in the United States and can be at least as costly and uncertain. The EU has established a unified centralized filing and approval system administered by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use designed to reduce the administrative burden of processing applications for pharmaceutical products derived from new technologies. In addition to obtaining regulatory approval of products, it is generally necessary to obtain regulatory approval of the facility in which the product will be manufactured. 
 We use and plan to continue to use third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities. Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product, including new safety risks, or the failure to comply with requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary or FDA-initiated action that could delay further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to an approved products approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, the imposition of additional mandatory post-market studies or clinical trials, or the imposition of or revisions to a risk evaluation mitigation strategies (REMS ) program, including distribution and/or use restrictions. 
 Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements, including requirements for adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports to the FDA, recordkeeping, product sampling and distribution, and, as discussed above, may be subject to mandatory post-market study and REMS requirements. In addition, the FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription drug products and biologics. In particular, a drug or biologic may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the products approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. The FDA also requires substantiation of any claims of superiority of one product over another, including the requirement that such claims be proven by adequate and well-controlled head-to-head clinical trials. The FDA also requires all promotional materials that discuss the use or effectiveness of a prescription drug or biologic to disclose in a balanced manner the risks and safety profile of the product.
Regulation of Laboratory Operations 
 Clinical laboratories that perform laboratory testing (except for research purposes only) on human patients are subject to regulation under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). CLIA regulates clinical laboratories by requiring that the laboratory be certified by the federal government, licensed by the state and comply with various operational, personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that clinical laboratory test results are accurate, reliable and timely. State law and regulations also apply to the operation of clinical laboratories. 
State Governments 
 Most states in which we operate have regulations that parallel federal regulations. Most states conduct periodic unannounced inspections and require licensing under such states procedures. Our research and development activities and the manufacture and marketing of our products are and will be subject to rigorous regulations relating to product safety and efficacy by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. 
Other Laws and Regulations 
 We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions, clinical, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research. The extent of government regulation applying to our business that might result from any legislative or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted.

Environmental 
 We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental protection measures. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our compliance with these regulations did not have during the past year and is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. 
Registrational Clinical Trials Process 
 Described below is the traditional registrational drug development track. Our current business strategy is to focus primarily on our PRO 140 Phase 2b/3 pivotal and investigative trials, to manage our Phase 2 trial for GvHD and to continue to explore other immunologic indications for PRO 140, as described above. 
Phase 1 
 Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug or biologic into humans. These studies are closely monitored and may be conducted in patients, but are usually conducted in a small number of healthy volunteer patients. These studies are designed to determine the metabolic and pharmacologic actions of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1, sufficient information about the investigational products pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects are obtained to permit the design of well-controlled, scientifically valid, Phase 2 studies. Phase 1 studies of PRO 140 have been conducted and completed by or on behalf of Progenics by certain principal investigators prior to our acquisition of PRO 140. 
Phase 2 
 Phase 2 includes the early controlled clinical studies conducted to obtain some preliminary data on the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition. This phase of testing also helps determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 studies are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, often involving several hundred people. In some cases, depending upon the need for a new drug, a particular drug candidate may be licensed for sale in interstate commerce after a pivotal Phase 2 trial. 
 Phase 2 is often broken into Phase 2a, which can be used to refer to pilot trials, or more limited trials evaluating exposure response in patients, and Phase 2b trials that are designed to evaluate dosing efficacy and ranges. 
 Phase 3 
 Phase 3 studies are expanded controlled clinical studies. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained in Phase 2, and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit/risk relationship of the drug. Phase 3 studies also provide an adequate basis for extrapolating the results to the general population and transmitting that information in the physician labeling. Phase 3 studies usually involve significantly larger groups of patients, and considerable additional expense. We were required to pay significant fees to third parties upon the first patient dosing in a Phase 3 trial of PRO 140, and we may be required to make additional fee payments to third parties upon the completion of additional milestones. See the discussion under the subheading PRO 140 Acquisition and Licensing Arrangements above. 
Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our development efforts may compete with more established biotechnology companies that have significantly greater financial and managerial resources than we do. 
 Advancing PRO 140 to commercialization is our highest priority. PRO 140 blocks a cell receptor called CCR5, which is the entry point for most strains of HIV virus. Pfizers Maraviroc (Selzentry®) is the only currently approved CCR5 blocking agent. Maraviroc like all other HIV approved drugs must be taken daily and are believed to have side effects and toxicity. For these reasons, we believe that our lead product, PRO 140, a monoclonal antibody, may prove to be useful in patients that cannot tolerate existing HIV therapies or desire a respite from those therapies. Nonetheless, manufacturers of current therapies, such as Pfizer, Gilead Sciences, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb and ViiV Healthcare, are very large, multi-national corporations with significant resources. We expect that these companies will compete fiercely to defend and expand their market share.

To construct a HAART regimen, three drugs from two classes of drugs are typically needed. Currently there are only five different classes of drugs from which four are primarily used to construct a HAART regimen. Each of these four classes of drugs has many drugs available in its respective class, except the entry inhibitor (EI) class, which has only two drugs available. The only two drugs in the EI class approved by the FDA are Maraviroc, a small molecule drug (which is taken orally once or twice a day) and Ibalizumab (which is an IV infusion administered once every two weeks). If approved, we believe that PRO 140 will be only the second approved drug outside of the main four classes of drugs approved for HIV since 2007. 
 The only other monoclonal antibody that recently received FDA approval is TMB-335, also referred to as Ibalizumab, which was developed by TaiMed Biologics. Ibalizumab targets the CD4 receptor on T-cells which is one of the two co-receptors required for HIV entry into T-cells.
 Our potential competitors include entities that develop and produce therapeutic agents. These include numerous public and private academic and research organizations and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies pursuing production of, among other things, biologics from cell cultures, genetically engineered drugs and natural and chemically synthesized drugs. Our competitors may succeed in developing potential drugs or processes that are more effective or less costly than any that may be developed by us or that gain regulatory approval prior to our potential drug candidates. Worldwide, there are many antiviral drugs for treating HIV. In seeking to manufacture, distribute and market the potential drugs we hope to have approved, we face competition from established pharmaceutical companies. Many of these potential competitors have substantially greater capital resources, management expertise, research and development capabilities, manufacturing and marketing resources and experience than we do. 
 We also expect that the number of our competitors and potential competitors will increase as more potential drugs receive commercial marketing approvals from the FDA or analogous foreign regulatory agencies. Any of these competitors may be more successful than us in manufacturing, marketing and distributing HIV treatments. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of PRO 140. We expect to depend on third-party manufacturing organizations and suppliers for all of our clinical trial quantities of PRO 140, in addition to previously manufactured supplies of PRO 140. We continue to explore alternative manufacturing sources, in order to ensure that we have access to sufficient manufacturing capacity in order to meet potential demand for PRO 140 in a cost-efficient manner. 
 We have engaged a contract manufacturing organization (CMO) to initiate the scale-up to commercial batch quantities of product, and develop the necessary controls and specifications to manufacture product on a consistent and reproducible manner. We have also contracted with a suitable CMO to fill, label, and package product into the final commercial package for commercial use.    In order to commercialize product, this scaled-up material will need to be validated under best practices, and demonstrated to meet approved specifications on an ongoing basis. GMP material will be produced as needed to support clinical trials for all therapeutic indications and until commercial product is approved by the FDA. We will rely on CMOs for all of our developmental and commercial needs. 
Research and Development Costs 
 Our research and development expenses totaled approximately $38.2 million, $20.2 million and $13.7 million for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2018, May 31, 2017 and May 31, 2016, respectively. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in future periods as the activity within our clinical trials expands and our biologics manufacturing processes and related regulatory compliance activities increase. 
Employees and Consultants 
 We currently have six full-time employees, as well as several independent consultants assisting us with our clinical trials of PRO 140 and manufacturing activities. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to identify or hire and retain additional employees or consultants on acceptable terms in the future.
