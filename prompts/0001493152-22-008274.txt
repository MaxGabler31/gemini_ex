Item 1. Business
Overview
 
TraQiQ was incorporated in the State of California on September 9, 2009 as Thunderclap Entertainment, Inc. On July 14, 2017, Thunderclap Entertainment, Inc. changed its name to TraQiQ, Inc. On July 19, 2017, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with the stockholders of OmniM2M, Inc. (“OmniM2M”) and TraQiQ Solutions, Inc. dba Ci2i Services, Inc. (formerly Ci2i Services, Inc. – amended November 6, 2019) (“Ci2i”) whereby the stockholders of OmniM2M and Ci2i agreed to exchange all of their respective shares, representing 100% ownership in OmniM2M and Ci2i in exchange for 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, respectively. The OmniM2M Shareholders and the Ci2i Shareholders were issued their respective 1,500,000 shares on a pro rata basis based on their respective holdings in OmniM2M and Ci2i in the Share Exchange Agreement. The Share Exchange was accounted for as a reverse merger whereas Ci2i is considered the accounting acquirer and TraQiQ, Inc. is considered the accounting acquiree. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements included the accounts of Ci2i for all periods presented and the accounts of TraQiQ, Inc. and OmniM2M, which was acquired by the Company on July 19, 2017 since the date of acquisition. For accounting purposes, the acquisition of OmniM2M is recorded at historical cost in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 805-50-25-2 as this is considered an acquisition of entities under common control as the management of the Company and OmniM2M control the activities of the respective companies. Prior to the merger with Ci2i and acquisition of OmniM2M, the Company was considered a shell company under Rule 12b-2 of Exchange Act. On December 1, 2017, the Company entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Ajay Sikka (“Sikka”), the sole shareholder of Transport IQ, Inc. whereby Sikka sold all of the shares in TransportIQ, Inc. (“TransportIQ”) in exchange for $18,109, in the form of cancellation of all of the debt of TransportIQ that was owed to the Company. The transaction became effective upon the execution of the agreement by Sikka and the Company; and Transport IQ, Inc, is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Because TransportIQ was commonly controlled and owned, the transaction was recorded at the historical carrying value of TransportIQ’s assets and liabilities.
 
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority on March 18, 2022, approved a reverse 1 for 8 stock split of the Company’s common shares. The reverse split was effective on March 21, 2022. The common shares and common share equivalents as well as the per-share amounts have been retroactively restated in accordance with ASC 855-10-25 and the loss per share figures have been retroactively restated in accordance with ASC 260-10-55-12.
 
Ci2i is a services company founded in 1998 that develops and deploys intelligent technologies and products in order to meet the demand for sustainable, integrated solutions. Ci2i’s primary focus has been in the analytics and intelligence segments. The Company is investing significantly in building products in the area of supply chain and last mile delivery.
 
On May 16, 2019, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with TRAQIQ Solutions Private Limited (TraQ Pvt Ltd), formerly known as Mann-India Technologies Pvt Ltd. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the shares of TRAQ Pvt Ltd. and assumed certain net liabilities in exchange for warrants exercisable over five-years to purchase up to 166,159 shares of common stock of the Company valued at $268 at an exercise price of $0.0008. The warrants are exercisable as follows: (i) 12,596 warrants immediately upon closing; (ii) 107,494 warrants exercisable one-year after the date of closing; and (iii) 46,069 warrants exercisable two-years after the date of closing. This transaction is being recorded as a business combination under ASC 805.
 
The warrants that are exercisable in one-year and two-years were conditioned upon TRAQ Pvt Ltd. achieving certain revenue figures and pre-tax profit percentages. For the warrants to become exercisable, TRAQ Pvt Ltd. was required to achieve target revenue of $1.1 million and pre-tax profit of 25% in 2019 and 2020, respectively, with the amount of such warrants becoming exercisable reduced proportionally to the extent TRAQ Pvt Ltd. failed to achieve these targets. A total of 52,391 of these warrants were cancelled effective May 16, 2021 as a result of these criteria not being achieved. There were 56,400 of these warrants exercised during 2021 and 57,368 warrants remain outstanding as of December 31, 2021.
 
Effective December 31, 2020, Ci2i acquired the net assets of OmniM2M and TransportIQ, and then dissolved those entities in January 2021. The value of those transactions were for the assumed liabilities of Omni and TransportIQ, and no cash was exchanged.

Our Company
 
With current operations concentrated in India, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, we are servicing business supply chains with last mile delivery and mobile commerce. We help businesses in emerging markets leverage the gig economy with a two-prong approach as follows: 1) We offer our software as a service so our customers can build their own delivery networks and 2) We currently offer our network of over 14,000 task workers in India through our Mimo network, with plans to expand this network into other geographic regions within our current operating footprint.
 
The Company has 110 employees focused primarily on software development and Mimo network operations, and a strategic planning team comprised of industry consultants who are looking at ways to further disrupt the supply chain across major industry segments. TraQiQ is continually looking at innovative ways to meet customer requirements faster, utilizing artificial intelligence (“AI”) tools to improve the customer experience by trying to predict their requirements in advance, while also regularly experimenting with new hardware technology like drones to improve deliveries. As we identify areas of both improvement and opportunity, our technology team works rapidly to meet those requirements.
 
With a strong team in place, a proven software solution, and an expanding network, as well as a customer base with global operations, TraQiQ expects to expand into two new countries in the next twelve months. These markets will be in South East Asia and Latin America, where the company already has a presence, and for which this contemplated expansion will be facilitated by and accelerated, in part, with anticipated proceeds from the proposed offering.

Market opportunity
 
The gig economy has grown over the last decade with the introduction of notable digital platforms such as Lyft, Uber, DoorDash Ola, Grab, Swiggy, Dunzo, and Task Rabbit, among others. With the rise of technology-enabled gig work platforms, more than 200 million people are now considered part of the global gig workforce, according to data from Mastercard Incorporated and Statista Inc.
 
With the growth of e-commerce, availability of task workers, and changes in general consumer behaviors in favor of “on-demand” products and services, we believe many businesses are increasingly moving towards, or participating in, a gig or task-based model. ASSOCHAM (India), projects the gig sector to grow to $455 billion (a cumulative annual growth rate of 17%) by 2024 in India and has the potential to expand at least two times the pre-pandemic estimates. ASSOCHAM (India) also estimates that India is likely to have 350 million gig jobs by 2025 (growing from the current 15 million as of May 2021), presenting a significant opportunity for job seekers to capitalize and adapt to the changing work dynamics.
 
Ernst & Young estimates that the e-pharma market in India will grow to $18 billion by 2023. We believe the COVID-19 pandemic may have accelerated this growth. Companies such as Amazon and Reliance have entered the medicine delivery market in India. TraQiQ’s Mimo service is preparing to enter the medicine delivery market in India.
 
In India, gig employment is not a novel concept. With its enormous informal economy and casual workers, India has long had the equivalent of gig work in both urban and rural areas, ranging from temporary agricultural workers to daily-wage construction laborers to delivery personnel. What has changed in recent years is the use of technology to match and expand on-demand services.
 
In the current world where so many people are ordering products ranging from food and drinks to medicine to socks online, we believe the “Last Mile” task worker represents a very valuable asset. This is the one and only direct connection to the customer for businesses fulfilling orders online. TraQiQ believes that “Last Mile” task workers are the only way for a business to establish a two-way relationship with the end customer to exchange information, money, transaction data and the actual goods.
 
This is where TraQiQ adds value, and it starts long before the actual delivery. The company’s technology helps our business-to-business customers with deliveries, assists with the financial transactions, and helps to build a long-term customer relationship via the Loyalty and Rewards program.
 
We believe the gig-economy model provides significant benefits for everyone within the gig eco-system:
 

● | The consumer gets instant gratification by, for example, receiving their food within an hour of ordering it. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The employers can minimize their costs and have flexibility to increase or decrease their workforce on demand. 
● | Employees/contractors can have flexibility and opportunity, with the full control over their jobs, hours and who they work with provided by gig jobs. 

 
We believe the gig economy helps companies, employees, and the economy, with benefits that go beyond traditional conceptions of convenience, on-demand availability, and flexibility. This is due to the underlying economic factors that platform-enabled gig work addresses at scale, as well as the collateral advantages it can provide, which can lead to a virtuous expansion cycle.

TraQSuite is a cloud based software platform with a revenue model based on initial and transaction-based licensing fees as well as consulting fees. Licensees pay an initial per-module fee that varies depending on the number of modules that are licensed. This fee is typically $10,000 per module. Customers are also billed on a per-user or per-transaction basis every month. User fees range from a $75 per month fee for the administrator to $5 per month for regular users. Transaction fees averages about $1 per transaction, with discounts for higher volumes. Most customers also pay initial consulting fees upfront for integration of TraQSuite with their legacy software and training of their employees in the use of TraQSuite.
 
Mimo Delivery and Task Services
 
TraQiQ operates the Mimo delivery and task service in India. This service runs on the TraQSuite platform. Mimo has 14,000+ independent contractors across India performing deliveries and fulfilling tasks for the largest corporations in the country. Our team at Mimo uses a sophisticated technology platform and a smartphone app to get their tasks completed. This is coupled with a verification and billing system that allows customers of all sizes to leverage this distribution infrastructure.
 
Mimo offers a broad set of services. These offerings can be classified into three broad categories:
 

● | Data collection and client verification (surveys, verification, on-boarding), 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Cash management & handling services, and 
● | Distribution and demand generation (order fulfilment, demand generation, delivery services for e-commerce companies)

Mimo assists the delivery and pickup segment of the banking and insurance industry by performing verifications, field investigations for loan requests, business verifications and employment verification, and also collects documents, assists in filling forms for banks, and completes data collection from customers.
 
Mimo works with microfinance institutions to collect cash, such as loan payments, convert cash to digital means like debit cards, and conduct data collection and surveys.
 
For consumer goods companies, Mimo does promotional marketing, Last Mile (hyper-local) delivery, merchant onboarding or activation, store audits, and route optimization for delivery. Mimo provides efficient end-to-end transshipment logistics. The framework manages and optimizes last-mile delivery and e-commerce logistics across the entire distribution chain with transparency and seamless integration. Mimo is currently in the planning stages to provide food, alcohol & medicine deliveries as well.
 
During the COVID pandemic, Mimo leveraged video as a platform for verification and document delivery. Now, the task workers include people who are in the field on bikes and trucks, people on a video screen, as well as people on the phone.
 
There are also data digitization tasks being done by Mimo task workers across the country. In a country like India where there are over 20 languages and multiple dialects, the task workers convert paper documents into electronic form in the same language or translate them into another language.
 
Revenue for the Mimo services is entirely based on the number of deliveries or other tasks that are performed. The customer is typically charged a fee of $3-$5 depending upon the geography, duration of task and distance that the task associate must travel. Two thirds of the fee is shared with the task associate, and one-third is retained by Mimo. While this revenue model has worked well in India where the services are currently offered, we may adjust it as needed as the service is offered in other geographic areas.
 
Customers
 
TraQiQ’s geographic focus is emerging and smaller economies. These are markets where we believe the barriers to entry are lower and the market potential is high.
 
TraQiQ is serving or has serviced a variety of large customers over the years. Some of our representative customers, most of which we are currently serving, include:
 

● | Railtel, one of the largest broadband infrastructure providers in India, which owns and operates a nationwide fiber network that runs alongside train tracks across India and for which Mimo collects subscriber payments. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Multiple large banking and finance industry customers, such as Hero Finance Corp, Yes bank, Aditya Birla group, ICICI bank, Ratnakar bank and Edelweiss Finance, for whom Mimo does deliveries and pickup of financial documents. 
● | Companies such as Facebook, for whom TraQiQ has done surveys, Verify360, for whom TraQiQ has done background verifications, and Jio, for whom the company facilitates SIM activation. 
● | Companies such as Unilever Cambodia, Ben & Jerry’s, Lakme and others in Southeast Asia and Australia/New Zealand, for whom TraQiQ facilitates contactless ice cream delivery with a unique wallet and customer retention program, cosmetics products loyalty programs, and virtual point of sale (POS) systems for remote delivery. 
● | A white-labelled delivery service in New Zealand, for whom TraQiQ provided a complete software platform. 
● | Companies in Latin America such as Seguros Bolivar, Panafoto, and BBVA, for whom TraQiQ provides FinTech products and solutions.

Although our strategy is to expand our business operations and customer base through our 2021 acquisitions of Rohuma and Mimo, most of our revenue has come historically from a few customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we had two major customers comprising 50% of our revenues, and at December 31, 2021 five customers represented 93% of our accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and at the end of that year, these customers accounted for 85% of our revenues and our accounts receivable, respectively. We do not believe that the risk associated with these customers will have an adverse effect on our business in the future.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Our gross revenue grew by 50% from 2019 to 2020 to reach the $1 million mark. By the end of the second quarter of 2021, our gross revenue had already equaled our gross revenue for the entire 2020 calendar year. In addition to our significant presence in India, Southeast Asia and Latin America, we have recently announced new customers in Australia, New Zealand and parts of Africa.
 
Our strategy is to grow our business through a combination of organic growth and strategic investments that bring new functionality and revenue streams to the company. We plan to enhance the functionality of our existing products, increase sales in the Indian market and enter into new emerging markets. Our data currently shows that within the first six months our business customers have an average increase of transactions of approximately 20%, and their customer’s transactions through our software increase by 15-20% over that period.
 
We believe we can continue to grow the Mimo network of task workers in India and are currently evaluating markets in Southeast Asia & Latin America for launching the Mimo service, as well. We plan to go live in at least two new markets within the next twelve months.
 
As hardware technology evolves, TraQiQ’s strategy is to provide additional delivery services by adding drones, e-bikes and robotic carts. The company has already had conversations with e-bike companies to equip the Mimo delivery team with electric bikes in the future.
 
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Matters
 
TraQiQ’s Mimo service provides jobs across India. Most of the people who are doing deliveries and performing tasks are not college educated. Based on our records, over 70% of our current task workers do not have a high school diploma. While many of them start with Mimo to supplement their other wages, they migrate towards spending most of their time with Mimo. Mimo gives them an opportunity to earn reasonable wages and they make their own hours. We believe many of these people would have a tough time finding jobs elsewhere due to lack of educational credentials. Many of them have grown into corporate roles at Mimo like trainers and supervisors.
Markets
 
In addition to its significant presence in India, Southeast Asia and Latin America, TraQiQ has recently added new customers in Australia, New Zealand and parts of Africa. Management regards Africa as having substantial growth potential. According to World Mobile Ltd., approximately 66% of sub-Saharan Africans do not have a banking relationship, but Plug and Play Tech Center estimates there are over 525 million smart phones in use in that area. We believe these customers would be likely candidates for phone-based mobile payment systems.
Competition
 
TraQiQ competes to some extent with several Last mile service providers with established global names as well as other service providers that are established brands in India. Unlike TraQiQ, many of these companies market directly to consumers rather than to other businesses. However, several of these competitors have significantly greater resources and name recognitions than TraQiQ.

TraQiQ’s Mimo service has a business-to-business (“B2B”) focus. This inherently results in longer term relationships with clients. We believe this, in turn, has a direct impact on longer term profitability. Mimo also has a deeper focus on semi-urban and rural areas, which we believe is a significant competitive advantage, as we believe most of our competitors have continued to focus on the larger cities. However, there is no assurance we will compete successfully or achieve profitability in the future.
 
We believe Mimo’s technology has some unique elements that provide strong differentiation. There are significant machine learning algorithms that power the service, enabling optimal route planning, reducing time to get a task done and minimizing agent productivity. There are modules in service that enable trackability and audit of all service elements.
 
We also compete with companies offering multiple software products. Larger companies have had software solutions for field-force management for a long time or have extended their products to include workforce management. Similarly, there are multiple fintech companies that offer products to facilitate transactions and payments. In the loyalty & rewards segment, there are also several companies with either a global or regional following.
 
TraQiQ believes its software solution is improved by its service network. We believe running a large-scale service provides a unique advantage to TraQiQ, as the real-time feedback from running the service enables the company to make continuous improvements to its software. In addition, TraQiQ goes beyond just the Last mile delivery. By providing a robust set of fintech and analytics solutions, TraQiQ provides a one-stop-shop for customers and partners.
 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2021 TraQiQ had a total of 110 full time employees. Approximately 100 of these employees are based in India. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we consider our company culture and employee relations to be strong.
 
In addition, we have independent contractor relationships with approximately 14,000 “gig” workers throughout India who primarily provide delivery services and other tasks for business customers.
 
Intellectual Property
 
To date, TraQiQ has not obtained any patents on the software it has developed or registered any of its trademarks. Instead, the company protects its intellectual property rights by relying on national and local statutory and common law rights in the jurisdictions in which it operates, as well as contractual restrictions. TraQiQ enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with its technical employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties who perform technical services. Although the company is not aware that its software or trademarks infringe the patents or trademarks of any other party, it may face allegations by third parties, including its competitors, that aspects of its software or trademarks infringe their trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights in a particular jurisdiction.
