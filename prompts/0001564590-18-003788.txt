 The Company reports certain unallocated selling, general and administrative activities and associated expenses within “Corporate”, including, in part, executive, legal, finance, marketing and certain facility costs. In addition, certain costs and earnings of employee benefit plans, such as pension income and share-based compensation, are included in Corporate and are not allocated to the reportable segments. Prior to the Separation (as defined below), many of these costs were based on allocations from R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (“RRD”); however, beginning October 1, 2016, the Company incurs such costs directly. 
 For the Company’s financial results and the presentation of certain other financial information by segment, see Note 17, Segment Information, to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. For financial information by geographic area, including net sales and long-lived assets, see Note 18, Geographic Area and Products and Services Information, to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.
 Client Services 
 The Company’s business is diversified across a range of products and services that enable it to work with companies and their advisors at different points throughout the business lifecycle, including private companies, public companies and companies that have filed for bankruptcy. The Company’s clientele is primarily focused in three areas: capital markets, investment markets, and language solutions, and the Company also provides clients with Data and Analytics services and products. The Company services clients in each of these areas with distinct, proprietary solutions tailored to meet their varying regulatory, transactional and communications needs and are able to achieve operational leverage through the use of common technology and service platforms. 
Global Capital Markets 
 The Company’s global capital markets (“GCM”) clients consist mainly of companies that are subject to the filing and reporting requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In 2017, approximately 39% of GCM net sales were compliance in nature. The Company also supports public and private companies throughout the mergers and acquisitions transaction process and in public and private capital markets transactions with deal management solutions focused on aiding transactional efficiency from inception to completion. In 2017, approximately 49% of GCM net sales were transactional in nature and approximately 12% of GCM net sales were related to Venue data room services. The Company provides a comprehensive suite of products and services to help its GCM clients comply with disclosure obligations, create, manage and deliver accurate and timely financial communications and manage public and private transaction processes. The Company also provides GCM clients with data and analytics services focused on uncovering intelligence from financial disclosures and offering distribution of company data and public filings.

Many of the Company’s GCM clients are companies required by the SEC to file reports pursuant to the Exchange Act, through the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system. The EDGAR system requires filers to prepare and submit filings using the SEC’s specified file formats. The Company’s EDGAR filing services assist its GCM clients in preparing Exchange Act filings that are compatible with the EDGAR system, and its employees have expertise and significant experience navigating this process with companies and their advisors. Specifically, many of the Company’s GCM clients are required to file proxy statements pursuant to the Exchange Act, and the Company’s Proxy Design service allows its clients to tailor these proxies by helping them to identify and match an appropriate style and format to their unique corporate culture and proxy-related objectives. The Company serves its GCM clients from local offices in most major cities in the U.S. and international jurisdictions in which the Company has operations. The Company believes that its local teams set the standard for reliable and efficient service and convenience. 
 As part of their regulatory filing requirements, the Company’s GCM clients who submit Exchange Act reports are also required to submit tagged files in the SEC-mandated eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) format. The Company provides these clients with a suite of tagging, review and validation tools to assist them with the XBRL requirements, and the Company has teams of accounting and financing professionals that assist its GCM clients with the processes of tag selection, tag review, file creation, validation and distribution, if required for their Exchange Act filings with the SEC. 
 In addition to the EDGAR filing services it provides, in which it formats and manages the content of the filings on behalf of its clients, the Company also offers a cloud-based disclosure management system called ActiveDisclosure that allows its GCM clients to collaboratively create, review and distribute financial communication and regulatory compliance documents on their own systems and then file directly on the SEC’s EDGAR system and File 16 for Section 16 filings, each of which, with assistance from the Company’s experienced professionals as needed, may reduce the time of the financial close process for its clients. 
 The Company provides services for GCM clients throughout the course of public and private business transactions, including those transactions that are subject to the requirements of the Securities Act. The Company assists many of its clients with certain transaction-related EDGAR filing and print services (including registration statements, prospectuses, offering circulars, proxy statements and XBRL-tagged filings), as well as with the technical aspects of the regulatory filing process. The Company has conferencing facilities in most major cities in the U.S. and the international jurisdictions in which it has operations for in-person working groups to meet to strategize and prepare documents for the transactional deal stream. The Company’s sites are outfitted to provide EDGAR filing capabilities, typesetting, meeting rooms and around-the-clock service. 
 In addition, for both public and private transactions, many of the Company’s GCM clients use its line of Venue products and services to manage the transaction process and increase efficiency. The Company’s Venue Virtual Data Room product is a cloud-based service that allows companies to securely organize, manage, distribute and track corporate governance, financing, legal and other documents in an online workspace accessible to internal and outside advisors alike. The Company’s GCM clients use Venue Virtual Data Rooms for capital markets transactions, mergers and acquisition transactions and other transactions to facilitate their document management and due diligence processes. 
 Venue Deal Marketing is a service provided through Peloton Documents, a company in which the Company has made a strategic investment. The Peloton solution creates interactive transaction related documents that enable companies, investors and advisors to communicate a company’s value and market and manage large, complex deals directly from their data room. Peloton’s technology leverages video and other rich media content as the vehicle to illustrate the value of a business by enabling the user to tell a more dynamic company story to better gauge interest from potential buyers and investors. Users include some of the world’s largest investment banks and private equity firms.

The eBrevia technology provides leading enterprise contract review and analysis solutions, leveraging machine learning to produce faster and more accurate results. eBrevia's software, which extracts and summarizes key legal provisions and other information, can be used in due diligence, contract management, lease abstraction, and document drafting. 
 SOXHUB, part of the ActiveDisclosure compliance solution, is a service provided through AuditBoard, a company in which the Company has made a strategic investment. AuditBoard is a SaaS technology company that provides a full suite of easy-to-use audit management and compliance solutions for SOX, operational audits, IT compliance, ERM and workflow management.

Global Investment Markets 
 The Company provides products and services to clients operating in global investment markets (“GIM”) within the United States and internationally, including United States based mutual funds, hedge and alternative investment funds, insurance companies and overseas investment structures for collective investments (similar to mutual funds in the United States). The Company also provides products to third party service providers and custodians who support investment managers, and it sells products and distribution services to the broker networks and financial advisors that distribute and sell investment products. The Company services the top variable annuity and variable life providers as well. The firms use the Company’s software products to manage data and content for data driven regulatory reporting as well as the creation of financial reports, prospectuses, fact sheets and other marketing and disclosure documents. The Company also provides software products to manage the distribution of the data and content in support of marketing, sales, and enrollment processes for the purchase of investment products. The Company supports healthcare clients in content management and the creation of pre- and post-enrollment materials. The Company processes orders and distributes customized, digitized communication for its healthcare clients, their brokers and their plan sponsors.
 In 2017, approximately 95% of GIM net sales, excluding postage and freight, were compliance in nature, while the remaining 5% of GIM net sales were transactional in nature.  In addition, approximately 53% of the Company’s 2017 GIM net sales, excluding postage and freight, were derived from clients in the mutual funds industry, while the remaining 47% of net sales were derived from clients in the healthcare and insurance industries. The Company’s teams currently support clients in the United States, Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, France, Luxembourg, India and Australia. 
 The Company offers its GIM clients a comprehensive set of products and services, including the FundSuiteArc software platform. FundSuiteArc is a suite of online content management products, which enable the Company’s GIM clients to store and manage information in a self-service, central repository so that compliance and regulatory documents can be easily edited, assembled, accessed, translated, rendered, and submitted to regulators. 
 In the United States, mutual funds, variable annuity products, and qualifying institutional hedge funds are required by the SEC to file registration forms and subsequent ongoing disclosures as well as XBRL-formatted filings pursuant to the 1940 Act, through the SEC’s EDGAR system. Using its filing capabilities, the Company works with many of its GIM clients to prepare and submit these 1940 Act and XBRL filings using the SEC’s specified file formats. 
 Changes in how investors consume information have led to new ways for investors to receive disclosure documents. GIM offers various technology and electronic delivery products and services to make the distribution of documents and content more efficient. Through an investment in, and an agreement with Mediant, the Company provides a suite of software to brokers and financial advisors which enable them to monitor and view shareholder communications.  The Company also supports the distribution, tabulation, and solicitation of shareholders for corporate elections and mutual fund proxy events.
 Language Solutions

The Company’s suite of services includes translation, editing, interpreting, proof-reading and multilingual typesetting, plus specialized content services such as transcreation (cultural adaptation of marketing materials), copywriting, linguistic validation by subject matter experts (specifically in the life sciences sector), transcription, voice-over, subtitling, and localization (website software adaptation for a specific market). The Company also provides application testing and quality assurance, which enable consistent performance of web, desktop and mobile applications, as well as cultural consulting services, helping corporations with their cross-cultural communications.

Spin-off Transaction
 Donnelley Financial’s Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended, was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 20, 2016. On October 1, 2016, Donnelley Financial became an independent publicly traded company through the distribution by R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (“RRD”) of approximately 26.2 million shares, or 80.75%, of Donnelley Financial common stock to RRD shareholders (the “Separation”). Holders of RRD common stock received one share of Donnelley Financial common stock for every eight shares of RRD common stock held on September 23, 2016. As part of the Separation, RRD retained approximately 6.2 million shares of Donnelley Financial common stock, or a 19.25% interest in Donnelley Financial. Donnelley Financial’s common stock began regular-way trading under the ticker symbol “DFIN” on the New York Stock Exchange on October 3, 2016.  On October 1, 2016, RRD also completed the previously announced separation of LSC Communications, Inc. (“LSC”), its publishing and retail-centric print services and office products business. On March 28, 2017, RRD completed the sale of 6.2 million shares of LSC common stock (RRD’s remaining ownership stake in LSC) in an underwritten public offering. As a result, beginning in the quarter ended June 30, 2017, LSC no longer qualified as a related party of the Company.
 On March 24, 2017, pursuant to the Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of September 30, 2016, by and between the Company and RRD, the Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 to register the offering and sale of shares of the Company’s common stock retained by RRD. The Registration Statement on Form S-1, as amended, was declared effective by the SEC on June 13, 2017. On June 21, 2017, RRD completed the sale of approximately 6.1 million shares of the Company’s common stock in an underwritten public offering. Upon the consummation of the offering, RRD retained approximately 0.1 million shares of the Company’s common stock which were subsequently sold by RRD on August 4, 2017. In conjunction with the underwritten public offering, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase approximately 0.9 million of the Company’s shares (the “Option Shares”) from the Company. The Company received approximately $18.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of the Option Shares, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions.

Competition 
 Technological and regulatory changes, including the electronic distribution of documents and data hosting of media content, continue to impact the market for our products and services. One of the Company’s competitive strengths is that it offers a wide array of communications products, compliance services and technologies, a global platform, exceptional sales and service and regulatory domain expertise, which provide differentiated solutions for its clients. 
 The financial communications services industry, in general, is highly competitive and barriers to entry have decreased as a result of technology innovation.   Despite some consolidation in recent years, the industry remains highly fragmented in the United States and even more so internationally with many in-country alternative providers. The Company expects competition to increase from existing competitors, as well as new and emerging market entrants. In addition, as the Company expands its product and service offerings, it may face competition from new and existing competitors. The Company competes primarily on product quality and functionality, service levels, subject matter regulatory expertise, security and compliance characteristics, price and reputation. 
 The impact of digital technologies has been felt in many print products, most acutely in the Company’s mutual fund, variable annuity and public company compliance business offerings. While the Company maintains a high-touch, service oriented business technology changes have provided alternatives to the Company’s clients that allow them to manage more of the financial disclosure process themselves.  For years, the Company has invested in its own applications, ActiveDisclosure, FundSuiteArc and Venue to serve clients and increase retention and has invested to expand capabilities and address new market sectors. The future impact of technology on the business is difficult to predict and could result in additional expenditures to restructure impacted operations or develop new technologies. In addition, the Company has made targeted acquisitions and investments in its existing business to offer clients innovative services and solutions, including acquisitions of EDGAR Online and MultiCorpora and investments in AuditBoard (formerly known as Soxhub), Mediant, Peloton and eBrevia that support the Company’s position as a technology service leader in the industry.  
 The Company’s competitors for SEC filing services for public company compliance clients include full service financial communications providers, technology point solution providers focused on financial communications and general technology providers. The Company’s competitors for SEC filing services for investment markets clients include full service traditional providers, small niche technology providers and local and regional print providers that bid against the Company for printing, mailing and fulfillment services.  Language solutions competes with global and local language service providers and language/globalization software vendors. 
 Market Volatility/Cyclicality 
 The Company is subject to market volatility in the United States and world economy, as the success of the transactional offering is largely dependent on the global market for IPOs, secondary offerings, mergers and acquisitions, public and private debt offerings, leveraged buyouts, spinouts and other transactions. The International segment is particularly susceptible to capital market volatility as most of the International business is capital markets transaction focused. The Company mitigates some of that risk by offering services in higher demand during a down market, like document management tools for the bankruptcy/restructuring process, and also moving upstream from the filing process with products like Venue, the Company’s data room solution. The Company also attempts to balance this volatility through supporting the quarterly/annual public company reporting process through its EDGAR filing services and ActiveDisclosure product, its investment markets regulatory and shareholder communications offering and continues to expand into adjacent growth businesses like language solutions and data and analytics, which have recurring revenues and are not as susceptible to market volatility and cycles. This quarterly/annual public company reporting process work also subjects the Company to filing seasonality shortly after the end of each fiscal quarter, with peak periods during the course of the year that have operational implications. Such operational implications include the need to increase staff during peak periods through a combined strategy of hiring additional full-time and temporary personnel, increasing the premium time of existing staff, and outsourcing production for a number of services. Additionally, clients and their financial advisors have begun to increasingly rely on web-based services which allow clients to autonomously file and distribute compliance documents with regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. While the Company believes that its ActiveDisclosure and FundSuiteArc solutions are competitive in this space, competitors are continuing to develop technologies that aim to improve clients’ ability to autonomously produce and file documents to meet their regulatory obligations. The Company continues to remain focused on driving recurring revenue in order to mitigate market volatility.
 Raw Materials 
 The primary raw materials used in the Company’s printed products are paper and ink. The paper and ink supply is sourced from a small set of select suppliers in order to ensure consistent quality that meets the Company’s performance expectations and provides for continuity of supply. The Company believes that the risk of incurring material losses as a result of a shortage in raw materials is unlikely and that the losses, if any, would not have a materially negative impact on the Company’s business.

Distribution
 The Company’s products are distributed to end-users through the U.S or foreign postal services, through retail channels, electronically or by direct shipment to customer facilities. 
 Customers 
 For each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s consolidated and combined net sales. 
 Technology
 The Company invests resources in developing software to improve its services. The Company invests in its core composition systems and client facing solutions and has also adopted market-leading third party systems which have improved the efficiency of its sales and operations processes.
Environmental Compliance 
 It is the Company’s policy to conduct its global operations in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that the Company may undertake in the future. However, in the opinion of management, compliance with the present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated and combined annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 3,400 employees.
