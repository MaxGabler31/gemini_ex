Item 1. Business 
Overview and Strategy
Cincinnati Bell Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries ("Cincinnati Bell", "we", "our", "us" or the "Company") provide integrated communications and IT solutions that keep consumer and business customers connected with each other and with the world. 
Through its Entertainment and Communications segment, the Company provides high speed data, video, and voice solutions to consumers and businesses over an expanding fiber network and a legacy copper network. During 2018, the Company acquired Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc. ("Hawaiian Telcom"), the largest full service provider of communication services on all of Hawaii's major islands. This acquisition added operational scale to our business by adding access to both Honolulu, a well-developed, fiber-rich city, as well as the growing neighbor islands. After the acquisition the Company's combined fiber network is nearly 16,500 fiber route miles. 
Through its IT Services and Hardware segment, business customers across the U.S., Canada and Europe rely on the Company for the sale and service of efficient, end-to-end communications and IT systems and solutions. During 2017, the Company expanded the geographic footprint of its IT Services and Hardware segment as a result of the acquisitions of SunTel Services LLC ("SunTel") and OnX Holdings LLC ("OnX"), transforming the segment into a North American hybrid-cloud services provider. In addition, the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom in 2018 also expanded the IT Services and Hardware segment to Hawaii.
Our goal is to continue the transformation of Cincinnati Bell from a legacy copper-based telecommunications company into a technology company with state-of-the-art fiber assets servicing customers with data, video, voice and IT solutions to meet their evolving needs. To this end, we believe that, by leveraging our past and future investments, we have created a company with a healthy balance sheet, growing revenue, growing profitability and sustainable cash flows. 
In an effort to achieve our objectives, we continue to focus on the following key initiatives:
•expand our fiber network; and
•grow our IT Services and Hardware segment.
Expand our fiber network
We invested $118.1 million of capital in the Entertainment and Communications segment in products that can be categorized as either Fioptics in Cincinnati or Consumer/SMB Fiber in Hawaii (collectively, "Consumer/SMB Fiber") during 2018. Revenue from these high demand products totaled $383.5 million, up 24% over the prior year including the contribution from Hawaii, and up 10% over the prior year in Cincinnati, mitigating the decline in legacy products. The primary focus of these investments is the expansion of high-speed internet and video products which are designed to compete directly with the cable Multiple System Operators, such as Charter Communications, serving the Company’s operating territories. Year-over-year growth in these products is outlined in the table below:

Cincinnati Operating Territory | 2018 | 2017 | | 2016 
Consumer / SMB Fiber Revenue (in millions): | $341.2 | $309.9 | | $254.1
Subscribers (in thousands): | | | | 
High-speed internet | 239.0 | | 226.6 | | 197.6
Video | 139.9 | | 146.5 | | 137.6
Voice | 107.6 | | 105.9 | | 96.2

Consumer / SMB Fiber Revenue (in millions): | $42.3
Subscribers (in thousands): | 
High-speed internet | 65.9

Voice | 30.3 


During the year, we passed an additional 38,800 addresses in the Greater Cincinnati area with Fioptics, which included a reduction in Fiber to the Node ("FTTN") addresses of 2,200 as we upgraded these addresses to Fiber to the Premise ("FTTP") addresses as FTTP is becoming a more relevant solution for our customers. As of December 31, 2018, the Fioptics products are now available to approximately 611,000 customer locations or 75% of the Greater Cincinnati operating territory. During the six months ended December 31, 2018, we passed an additional 6,900 addresses in Hawaii. The Consumer/SMB Fiber products are now available to 240,500 addresses, or 49% of the operating territory in Hawaii, including Oahu and the neighbor islands. 
In 2018, the Company also invested $25.1 million in Enterprise Fiber products, which includes fiber and IP-based core network technology. These investments position the Company to meet increased business and carrier demand within Greater Cincinnati and in contiguous markets in the Midwest region. In Hawaii expenditures are for high-bandwidth data transport products, such as metro-ethernet, including the Southeast Asia to United States ("SEA-US") cable. We continue to evolve and optimize network assets to support the migration of legacy products to new technology, and as of December 31, 2018, the Company has:

• | increased the total number of commercial addresses with fiber-based services (referred to as a lit address) to 26,600 in Greater Cincinnati and 19,100 in Hawaii by connecting approximately 4,000 additional lit addresses in Greater Cincinnati during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 1,500 additional lit addresses in Hawaii during the six months ended December 31, 2018;


• | expanded the fiber network to span more than 11,900 route miles in Greater Cincinnati and 4,600 route miles in Hawaii; and


• | provided cell site back-haul services to approximately 90% of the 1,000 cell sites in the Greater Cincinnati market, of which approximately 97% of these sites are lit with fiber, and 69% of the 900 cell sites in Hawaii, all of which are lit with fiber.

As a result of our investments, we have generated year-over-year Entertainment and Communications revenue growth each year since 2013. The Company's expanding fiber assets allow us to support the ever-increasing demand for data, video and internet devices with speed, agility and security. We believe our fiber investments are a long-term solution for our customers' bandwidth needs.
Grow our IT Services and Hardware Segment
Cincinnati Bell continues to grow the IT Services and Hardware segment by developing new products, as well as expanding its reach to new customers. During 2017, the Company completed the acquisitions of SunTel and OnX, which enabled us to extend our geographic footprint across the U.S., Canada and Europe, diversify our customer base, and expand our product portfolio. During 2018, the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom helped to expand the segment even further across the U.S. to Hawaii. The Company continues to develop high-demand products for business customers through our investments in unified communications and cloud services. Our ability to be innovative and to react to the changing technology demands of our customers is important to the growth of our IT Services and Hardware segment. Our offerings under the Infrastructure Solutions practice provide a platform for buyer engagement and an opportunity for bridging the customer to higher value professional and managed services. In 2018, the Company saw significant increases in revenue from Communications solutions, specifically Unified Communications as a Service ("UCaaS"), Software-Defined Wide Area Network ("SD-WAN") and Network as a Service ("NaaS"), to customers that historically have purchased our hardware offerings.

We supply the architecture and integration intelligence, labor and hardware as well as any combination of these services. These projects can be established based on hourly billing rates, service-level driven agreements or utility-based managed service models. Customers are attracted to our ability to combine our historic knowledge, unique assets and talented workforce in order to help them improve their operational efficiency, mitigate risk and reduce costs.

Entertainment and Communications 
The Entertainment and Communications segment provides products and services such as high-speed internet, data transport, local voice, video and other services. Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company LLC ("CBT"), a subsidiary of the Company, is the incumbent local exchange carrier ("ILEC") for a geography that covers a radius of approximately 25 miles around Cincinnati, Ohio, and includes parts of northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana. CBT has operated in this territory for over 145 years. Voice and data services in the Enterprise Fiber and Legacy categories that are delivered beyond the Company's ILEC territory, particularly in Dayton and Mason, Ohio, are provided through the operations of Cincinnati Bell Extended Territories LLC ("CBET"), a subsidiary of CBT. On July 2, 2018, the Company acquired Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom is the ILEC for the State of Hawaii and the largest full service provider of communications services and products in that state. Originally incorporated in Hawaii in 1883 as Mutual Telephone Company, Hawaiian Telcom has a strong heritage of over 135 years as Hawaii’s communications carrier. Its services are offered on all of Hawaii’s major islands, except its video service, which currently is only available on the island of Oahu. The key products and services provided by the Entertainment and Communications segment include the following:
Data
The Company's data products include high-speed internet access, data transport and interconnection services. Consumer demand for increased internet speeds is accelerating, and more customers are opting for higher bandwidth solutions. To address this demand, the Company is focused on building out FTTP addresses, enabling these addresses to receive speeds up to one gigabit per second ("Gbps"). FTTP addresses now cover 58% of the market in Greater Cincinnati and 34% of the market in Hawaii. The Company is now able to provide internet speeds of 30 megabits per second ("Mbps") or more to approximately 75% of Greater Cincinnati and 68% of homes and businesses on the island of Oahu, of which approximately 472,000 and 167,000 addresses are capable of receiving speeds up to one Gbps in Greater Cincinnati and Hawaii, respectively.

As business customers migrate from legacy products and copper-based technology, our metro-ethernet product becomes the access method of choice due to its ability to support multiple applications on a single physical connection. We are also expanding our metro-ethernet platform to deliver services across a wider geography to target business customers beyond our ILEC footprint. The Company’s regional network connects Greater Cincinnati, Columbus, and Dayton, Ohio, as well as Indianapolis, Indiana, Chicago, Illinois, and Louisville, Kentucky. 
As a result of the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom the Company gained access to the SEA-US trans Pacific submarine cable system connecting Indonesia, the Philippines, Guam, Hawaii and the mainland United States.  The system provides an initial 20 Terabytes per second ("Tbps") of capacity using state-of-the-art 100Gbps technology to accommodate the increase in data consumption.
Voice
Voice represents local service over both copper and fiber. It also includes consumer long distance, digital trunking, switched access and other value-added services such as caller identification, voicemail, call waiting and call return.
The Company's voice access lines over copper continue to decrease as our customers have increasingly employed wireless technologies in lieu of wireline voice services ("wireless substitution"), migrated to competitors, or migrated to VoIP services provided by the Company and others.
Customers purchasing traditional long distance service can choose from a variety of long distance plans, which include unlimited long distance for a flat fee, purchase of minutes at a per-minute-of-use rate, or a fixed number of minutes for a flat fee. The Company's long distance lines and related minutes of use have continued to decline as a result of wireless substitution. 
Video
In the Greater Cincinnati territory, the Company launched Fioptics in 2009 and initially focused our fiber network investment on densely populated areas, such as apartments and condominiums. Since that time, Fioptics has been deployed over a much broader base and is now available to approximately 75% of Greater Cincinnati. As of December 31, 2018, we have 139,900 video subscribers in Greater Cincinnati. Our Fioptics customers enjoy access to over 400 entertainment channels, including digital music, local, movie and sports programming with over 150 high-definition channels, parental controls, HD DVR and video On-Demand. 
In Hawaii, the Company launched its next-generation television service on the island of Oahu in July 2011. The TV service is 100% digital with hundreds of local, national, international and music channels, including high-definition, premium, pay-per-view channels and video on-demand service. TV service has been deployed to 48,800 subscribers in Hawaii as of the end of 2018. 
Other
Other revenue consists of revenue generated from wiring projects for business customers, Connect America Fund support (see “—Regulation” for further discussion of universal service), advertising, directory assistance, maintenance and information services. 
IT Services and Hardware 
The IT Services and Hardware segment provides a full range of managed IT solutions, telephony and IT equipment sales, and professional IT staffing services. These services and products are provided through the Company's subsidiaries in various geographic areas throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe. By offering a full range of Infrastructure Solutions in addition to Cloud, Communications and Consulting services, the IT Services and Hardware segment provides end-to-end IT solutions designed to reduce cost and mitigate risk while optimizing performance for its customers.
The key products and services provided by the IT Services and Hardware segment include the following:
Consulting
The Company's consulting services offerings consist of IT staffing and project-based engagements, including engineering and installation of voice, connectivity and IT technologies, development of digital application solutions and staff augmentation by highly skilled and industry-certified technical resources. Engagements can be short-term IT implementation and project-based work as well as longer term staffing and permanent placement assignments. The Company utilizes a team of experienced recruiting and hiring personnel to provide its customers with a wide range of skilled IT professionals.

Communications
The Company offers a complete portfolio of hosted solutions that include converged IP communications platforms of data, voice, video and mobility applications. We offer our customers expert management for all hardware and software components, including maintenance contracts and service level agreement ("SLA") based services. Fully hosted and managed, these voice platforms and applications can also be delivered as a service for a monthly utility fee allowing our customers to scale without a large capital investment. 
The solutions offered in the Communications practice include UCaaS, SD-WAN, NaaS, Contact Center and other Networking Solutions. UCaaS provides a portfolio of solutions that includes VoIP, room-based video, mobile solutions, chat/presence, messaging, web conferencing, audio conferencing, social media, contact center solutions, and more in order to serve a customer's collaboration needs. Cloud delivered SD-WAN is a revolutionary, agile platform to deploy, manage and monitor hybrid public, private, wireline and wireless networks. NaaS is a fully managed networking solution with cloud integration, security, switching, Wi-Fi, management, monitoring and SD-WAN. Our Contact Center offering features speech-enabled Interactive Voice Response ("IVR"), call-back services, call analytics and surveys, speech analytics, alerts and notification, and improved customer satisfaction and productivity. Additionally, we manage the maintenance of a large base of customers with traditional voice systems as well as converged VoIP systems under Networking Solutions.
Cloud
Virtual data center ("VDC") is a robust and scalable virtual infrastructure consisting of equipment, security, people and processes. This offering is provided in three different models - private cloud, dedicated cloud or public cloud - and provides customers with either a long-term or a short-term flexible solution that is fully managed by the Company and monitored around the clock from our Enterprise Network Operations Center ("ENOC"). 
Storage is a flexible, on-demand solution that enables businesses to eliminate capital expenditures and ongoing asset management with SLA-based services. The Company offers Tier I, Tier II and Tier III storage to meet its customers' availability, accessibility, protection, performance and capacity needs.
Backup is a scalable solution that allows businesses to eliminate capital outlay and ongoing equipment management with SLA-based services and includes virtual data center, hardware, software, monitoring and support.
The Company provides SLA-based monitoring and management services utilizing our ENOC. The ENOC includes highly certified engineers and operation experts that proactively monitor and manage our customers’ technology environments and applications. Standalone monitoring services provide customers with scheduled and automatic checks of customers' servers, routers, switches, load balancers and firewalls. We also provide customers with advance trouble shooting, repair and changes of customers' servers, routers, switches, load balancers and other network devices from our ENOC. These services can be provided to customers with equipment provided by the Company, or customer-owned equipment, and do not have geographical constraints. Services can be purchased individually or bundled by combining multiple products, services, and assets into a utility or service model. 
Infrastructure Solutions
The Company maintains premium resale relationships and certifications with a variety of branded technology vendors which allows it to competitively sell, architect and install a wide array of telecommunications and IT infrastructure equipment to meet the needs of its customers. 
Sales and Distribution Channels 
The Company’s Entertainment and Communications segment utilizes a number of distribution channels to acquire customers. As of December 31, 2018, the Company operated nine retail stores in the Cincinnati operating territory to market and distribute our Fioptics suite of products. The Company works to locate retail stores in high traffic but affordable areas, with a distance between each store that considers optimal returns per store and customer convenience. The Company also offers fully-automated, end-to-end web-based sales of various other Company services and accessories for both the Cincinnati operating territory and the Hawaii operating territory. In addition, the Company utilizes a call center, as well as a door-to-door sales force, to target the sale of our consumer products to residents.

Form 10-K Part I | Cincinnati Bell Inc.

For both operating segments, we utilize a business-to-business sales force and a call center organization to reach business customers in our operating territories. Larger business customers are supported by sales account representatives and solution architects located in our branch offices across the U.S., Canada and Europe that understand the customer's technology needs and recommend Company offered solutions. Smaller business customers are supported through a telemarketing sales force, customer representatives and store locations.
The IT Services and Hardware segment utilizes an indirect distribution channel to sell services, primarily focused on Communications. Compensation to the distributor is success-based and typically involves a residual payment based on revenue from customers.
Suppliers and Product Supply Chain
The Company generally subjects purchases to competitive bids and selects its vendors based on price, service level, delivery terms, quality of product and terms and conditions. 
The Entertainment and Communications segment's primary purchases are for video content, network equipment, software, fiber cable and contractors to maintain and support the growth of the fiber network. The Company maintains facilities and operations for storing cable and other equipment, product distribution and customer fulfillment. 
The IT Services and Hardware segment primarily purchases IT and telephony equipment that is either sold to a customer, or used to provide service to the customer. The Company is a certified distributor of leading technology and software solutions including, but not limited to, Cisco, EMC, Avaya and Oracle. Most of this equipment is shipped directly to the customer from vendor locations, but the Company does maintain warehouse facilities for replacement parts and equipment testing and staging. 
In addition, we have long-term commitments to outsource various services, such as certain information technology functions, cash remittance and accounts payable functions, call center operations and maintenance services. 
Competition
The telecommunications industry is very competitive, and the Company competes against larger, well-capitalized national providers.
The Entertainment and Communications segment faces competition from other local exchange carriers, wireless service providers, inter-exchange carriers, as well as cable, broadband, and internet service providers. The Company has lost, and will likely continue to lose access lines as a portion of the customer base migrates to competitive wireline or wireless providers in lieu of the Company’s services. Wireless providers, particularly those that provide unlimited wireless service plans with no additional fees for long distance, offer customers a substitution service for the Company’s local voice and long-distance services. The Company believes wireless substitution and competition is the reason for the largest portion of the Company’s access line and long-distance line losses. 
Our Consumer/SMB Fiber and Enterprise Fiber products also face intense competition from cable operators, other telecom companies and niche fiber companies. Many of our competitors have lower operating costs and access to resources that provide economies of scale that allow them to more aggressively price products, as well as provide products on a much broader scale given their expanded geographic operations. Our competitors continuously upgrade their service quality and offerings which could substantially erode the competitive advantage we currently have with our fiber-based products. These competitive factors could limit the Company's ability to grow revenue and cash flows despite the strategic initiatives implemented.
The Company's video product also faces competition from a number of different sources, including companies that deliver movies, television shows and other video programming over broadband Internet connections. Increasingly, content owners are utilizing Internet-based delivery of content directly to consumers, some without charging a fee for access to the content. Furthermore, due to consumer electronics innovations, consumers are able to watch such Internet-delivered content on television sets and mobile devices. Increased customer migration to these non-traditional entertainment products could result in increased churn and decreased penetration for video; however, this trend could also drive increased demand for our high speed internet product.
10


Form 10-K Part I | Cincinnati Bell Inc.

The IT Services and Hardware segment competes against numerous information technology consulting, web-hosting, and computer system integration companies, many of which are larger in scope and well-financed. The Company believes that participants in this market must grow rapidly and achieve significant scale to compete effectively. Other competitors may consolidate with larger companies or acquire software application vendors or technology providers, enabling them to more effectively compete. This consolidation could affect prices and other competitive factors in ways that could impede the ability of these businesses to compete successfully in the market. In addition, as more customers migrate to the public cloud, we will see declines in the demand for Infrastructure Solutions. However, this trend could provide an opportunity in Consulting, Communications and Cloud Services as the Company has IT professionals that can assist customers through this migration to the public cloud.
Customers 
The Company had no customers whose revenue comprised greater than 10% of total revenue in 2018 and 2017. The Company had sales with one customer, GE, which contributed 11% to total revenue in 2016. 
Employees 
At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 4,300 employees. Approximately 35% of its employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 20% of total employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the Communications Workers of America (“CWA”), which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO, and approximately 15% of total employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 1357. The collective bargaining agreements with the CWA and IBEW are effective through the second quarter of 2021 and third quarter of 2022, respectively. 
Website Access and Other Information
The Company was incorporated under the laws of Ohio in 1983 with its headquarters at 221 East Fourth Street, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202 (telephone number (513) 397-9900 and website address http://www.cincinnatibell.com).
