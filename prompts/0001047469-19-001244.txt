 Sirius International Corporate Member participates in the Lloyd's market, which in turn provides underwriting capacity to Syndicate 1945. The Lloyd's market is known for its ability to provide innovative, tailored coverage and capacity for unique, complex, large and hard-to-place global risks. Syndicate 1945 began writing business in 2011. Initially, Syndicate 1945 was authorized by Lloyd's to write primarily Accident and Health. In 2013, this was extended to include other lines written by London of Property and Marine business. In 2014, Sirius Group established its own Lloyd's managing agent, Sirius International Managing Agency, to manage Syndicate 1945. For the 2019 underwriting year, Syndicate 1945 was authorized by Lloyd's to write a stamp capacity of £81 million or approximately $103 million (based on the December 31, 2018 GBP to USD exchange rate). By exiting certain lines, reshaping existing business such as Upstream Energy insurance and adding new lines like U.S. Casualty Treaty, the Syndicate has reduced volatility to strive for increased profitability. 
 IMG is a full service managing general underwriter ("MGU") that has been an award-winning provider of global health and travel insurance benefits and assistance service for over 25 years and a business partner of Sirius Group since 1997. IMG has been Sirius Group's largest insurance producer over the past several years before its acquisition in 2017. IMG offers a full, innovative line of international medical insurance products, trip cancellation programs, medical management services and 24/7 emergency medical and travel assistance. IMG is based in Indianapolis, Indiana and also has offices in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. For 2018 and 2017, IMG produced $175 million and $165 million of gross written premiums, respectively, the vast majority of which are written on Sirius Group paper. The acquisition of IMG offers Sirius Group additional access to accident and health products that are complementary to its global product offerings, as well as growth opportunities in Europe and Asia. 
 Armada is a specialty health services business based in Hunt Valley, Maryland that strengthens health care coverage through ArmadaCare and ArmadaHealth. ArmadaCare is a supplemental medical insurance MGU that markets and underwrites its signature UltimateHealth supplemental health product designed for C-Suite executives, as well as PlenaHealth and ComplaMed, which are targeted towards broader segments of the workforce. These products make the health care process easier and more efficient for employees and affinity constituent groups, and differentiate themselves with "white glove" service. The ArmadaCare products are written on both Transamerica and Sirius America paper, with the majority of business transitioning to Sirius Group commensurate with Sirius America's policy filing and a transition agreement between Transamerica and Sirius Group. ArmadaHealth is a health care data science business that focuses on addressing one of the biggest problems, and opportunities, of the United States health care system, the physician referral process. This transformation of access to specialty care aims to improve patient satisfaction and health outcomes, while at the same time reduce costs. The ArmadaHealth product is one of the services embedded in the aforementioned ArmadaCare products. For 2018 and 2017, Armada produced $120 million and $107 million of gross written premiums, respectively.

   Sirius Global Solutions is a Connecticut-based division of Sirius Group specializing in the acquisition and management of runoff liabilities for insurance and reinsurance companies both in the United States and internationally. The Sirius Global Solutions team is comprised of a dedicated group of financial, actuarial and claims professionals experienced in the management and resolution of complex insurance liabilities as well as the structuring of transactions designed to enable owners to exit an insurance business and extract trapped capital. Acquisitions typically involve transactions at a significant discount to book value and/or retrospective reinsurance agreements, including loss portfolio transfers, and undergo an extensive due diligence process. Sirius Group can derive value from these transactions not only from the discounted purchase price, but also from the investment income on insurance float, the potential settlement of claims below the carried level of reserves and the harvesting of other embedded assets, including the value of shell companies and licenses. Since its formation in 2000, Sirius Global Solutions has executed 16 transactions, involving 21 companies, which have resulted in approximately $192 million of cumulative after-tax income through December 31, 2018. Most recently, in 2018, Sirius Global Solutions completed the acquisition of WRM America Indemnity Company, Inc. ("WRM America") from WRM America Indemnity Holding Company, LLC for $17 million in cash. WRM America is a New York-domiciled insurer with a run-off book of business mainly comprised of general liability, educator's legal liability, automobile liability and physical damage, property and excess catastrophe liability. 
   Our History 
 On April 18, 2016, CMIG International Pte. Ltd. ("CMIG International"), through its Bermuda holding company CM Bermuda Ltd., purchased Sirius Group and its subsidiaries from White Mountains Insurance Group Ltd. ("White Mountains") for approximately $2.6 billion at the time of close. On November 5, 2018, Sirius Group merged (the "Merger") with Easterly Acquisition Corp. ("Easterly") pursuant to a definitive agreement and plan of merger, which resulted in Sirius Group becoming a publicly listed company. Following the Merger, the Company's common shares are traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "SG." 
 Sirius Group writes treaty and facultative reinsurance, as well as primary insurance business. Sirius Group's primary insurance business has historically been predominantly accident and health insurance. In recent years, Sirius Group expanded its accident and health primary business capabilities in the U.S. via the acquisitions of IMG and Armada in 2017. In addition to growing in accident and health insurance, Sirius Group further expanded its primary insurance platform launching its primary Surety and Environmental insurance platforms in the U.S. in late 2017. In mid-2018, we began writing primary Casualty insurance through Pie Insurance Holdings, Inc. ("Pie Insurance"), a start-up specializing in a data driven approach to workers compensation insurance, where we also have a minority investment and carrier relationship. In addition to these primary insurance platforms, Sirius Group re-entered the U.S. Casualty reinsurance market in early 2017. 
   Competitive Strengths 
 Sirius Group's management believes that the following competitive strengths position Sirius Group to capitalize on the opportunities presented in the insurance and reinsurance marketplace: 
   Global Multi-Line Reinsurer with Proven Track Record and Diversified Book of Business 
 Sirius Group is a global multi-line insurance and reinsurance company with a long operating history. Sirius Group writes a diversified book of insurance and reinsurance business across different risk types and geographic locations. As of December 31, 2018, Sirius Group had over 2,000 clients in over 140 countries with over 7,000 different reinsurance treaties. The majority of Sirius Group's business is relatively short-tailed though its Specialty & Casualty segment started to underwrite longer-tailed lines of business in 2017. Sirius Group's management believes diversification is a competitive advantage, which increases return per unit of risk, provides access to risk worldwide and reduces the overall volatility of results. Diversification is also the cornerstone of managing the cyclicality of insurance and reinsurance markets. 
   History of Long-Term Customer Relationships 
 Sirius Group's global branch network, managed by a long-tenured and experienced team, has allowed Sirius Group to develop long-standing, local customer relationships. These strong relationships have allowed Sirius Group's operating team to profitably navigate through both favorable and unfavorable market conditions. Sirius Group's profit center managers have an average of 18 years of employment with Sirius Group and 29 years in the insurance industry. 
 3

   Over the years, Sirius Group has developed into a leading reinsurer primarily in Europe but also in the United States and in other parts of the world. Of Sirius Group's 2018 underwriting year written premiums, 30% are from clients of 20 or more years and 54% are from clients of 10 or more years. Sirius Group's long-standing relationships have contributed to its position in its markets that enables it to lead or co-lead or have influence on prices in over 58% of its business (as measured on December 31, 2018), which influences terms and conditions. 
   Prudent, Disciplined Approach to Risk Management 
 Sirius Group is guided by its core operating principles and believes that a long-term commitment to disciplined underwriting and prudent pricing is firmly ingrained in its corporate culture. Sirius Group focuses risk management efforts on ensuring that exposure to potential loss in any business area remains at an acceptable level. Although these efforts include extensive modeling, Sirius Group also evaluates its total limit loss in a particular region to ensure that not only is the probable maximum loss ("PML") within its tolerance, but the maximum foreseeable loss is as well. 
 Efficient Capital Deployment and Financial Strength 
 Sirius Group's management believes that its long-standing presence in multiple markets, including North America and Europe, has allowed Sirius Group to deploy its capital in an efficient manner throughout the world. Sirius Group seeks to maintain capital and leverage at levels that support its ratings, and deploys its capital opportunistically across the entire organization. Another important benefit of Sirius Group's capital structure is the $261 million deferred tax liability on retained earnings in Sirius Group's Swedish "safety reserve" position as of December 31, 2018. Pursuant to Swedish regulations, all the retained earnings in the safety reserve, including the deferred tax liability, are available to pay claims and deemed to be capital supporting underwriting. 
 Management's Extensive Experience 
 Sirius Group's executive management team has extensive experience in the insurance industry across operations, strategy and mergers and acquisitions. On average, each team member has been with Sirius Group for 14 years. Sirius Group strives to continue to attract and retain exceptional talent by encouraging individual personal development of all its employees and rewarding them for outstanding performance. 
 Growth Strategy 
 Sirius Group's corporate objective is to grow intrinsic value per share by maximizing underwriting profits through market cycles while preserving and achieving long-term growth. Sirius Group intends to pursue this objective with the following strategies: 
 Maintain Broad Geographic Coverage Across Multiple Lines 
 Sirius Group intends to leverage its multi-line offerings across a broad geographic scope to grow its business when appropriate. Sirius Group has had a long-standing presence in multiple markets and across multiple product categories and has developed long-term relationships with brokers and ceding companies. Sirius Group seeks to use management's expertise, experience and market relationships to identify and underwrite well-priced risks while delivering innovative risk transfer solutions to customers. Sirius Group believes that its flexibility and expertise in diverse insurance and reinsurance markets will allow it to create a well-balanced and profitable portfolio of risks across market cycles. 
 Manage Capital Prudently 
 Sirius Group actively manages its capital and business profile. Sirius Group strives to underwrite business only when the price and other terms and conditions are attractive. If Sirius Group needs to reduce its business volumes due to overly aggressive competition, it intends to do so, as it has done in the past. The "Reportable Segments" table under "Products and Services" later in this section demonstrates Sirius Group's opportunistic underwriting approach, whereby Sirius Group has increased and decreased writings in various lines of business commensurate with prevailing market conditions. When appropriate, Sirius Group will consider dedicated pools of outside capital and use of retrocessional coverage. 
 4

     Continue to Identify Opportunistic Acquisitions 
 Sirius Group has the in-house mergers and acquisitions capability and experience to source and successfully execute upon attractive opportunities. Sirius Group will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and pursue those that meet its strict criteria to generate attractive financial returns. Acquisitions can be in the form of active operations, such as the recent acquisitions of IMG and Armada, or in the form of run-off opportunities, which are led by the dedicated team at Sirius Global Solutions. While Sirius Group has an active and ongoing effort to pursue acquisitions, management believes that Sirius Group's opportunistic and disciplined approach and experience ensures that it will be selective in pursuing transactions. In a given year, Sirius Group may complete several transactions or may not complete any, depending on the quality of opportunities that become available. Sirius Group is optimistic that there will continue to be attractive opportunities in the future. 
 Maintain a Disciplined Investment Approach 
 Sirius Group's investment philosophy is to maximize long-term total returns (after-tax) while taking prudent levels of risk and maintaining a diversified portfolio, subject to its investment guidelines and various regulatory restrictions. Under this total return investment approach, gains in market prices of securities are valued equally with yield income. 
 Insurance and Reinsurance Overview 
   Products and Services 
 Sirius Group writes primary insurance and reinsurance business. Sirius Group's primary insurance business is written predominantly by several MGUs in the accident and health space. Sirius Group employs a detailed selection process for these MGU partners, and has narrowly defined underwriting standards in place that are closely monitored by Sirius Group staff. In addition to the day-to-day interactions that Sirius Group has with the MGUs, audits are performed on a regular basis. 
 Reinsurance is an arrangement in which a reinsurance company (the "reinsurer") agrees to indemnify an insurance company (the "ceding company") for insurance risks underwritten by the ceding company. Reinsurance can benefit a ceding company in a number of ways, including reducing exposure on individual risks, providing catastrophe protections from large or multiple losses, and assisting in maintaining acceptable capital levels as well as financial and operating leverage ratios. Reinsurance can also provide a ceding company with additional underwriting capacity by permitting it to accept larger risks and underwrite a greater number of risks without a corresponding increase in its capital. Reinsurers may also purchase reinsurance, known as retrocessional reinsurance, to cover risks assumed from ceding companies. Reinsurance companies often enter into retrocessional agreements for many of the same reasons that ceding companies enter into reinsurance agreements. 
 Reinsurance is generally written on a treaty or facultative basis. Treaty reinsurance is an agreement whereby the reinsurer assumes a specified portion or category of risk under all qualifying policies issued by the ceding company during the term of the agreement, usually one year. When underwriting treaty reinsurance, the reinsurer does not evaluate each individual risk and generally accepts the original underwriting decisions made by the ceding company. Facultative reinsurance, on the other hand, is underwritten on a risk-by-risk basis, which allows the reinsurer to determine pricing for each exposure. 
 Treaty reinsurance is typically written on either a proportional or excess of loss basis. A proportional reinsurance treaty is an arrangement whereby a reinsurer assumes a predetermined proportional share of the premiums and losses generated on specified business. An excess of loss treaty is an arrangement whereby a reinsurer assumes losses that exceed a specific retention of loss by the ceding company. 
 A significant period of time normally elapses between the receipt of insurance premiums for MGUs and reinsurance premiums from ceding companies and the payment of the claims. While premiums are generally paid to the insurer or reinsurer following inception of the underlying coverage, the claims process is delayed and generally begins upon the occurrence of an event causing an insured loss followed by: (i) the reporting of the loss by the insured to its broker or agent; (ii) the reporting by the broker or agent to the MGU or ceding company; (iii) the reporting by the ceding company to its reinsurance intermediary or agent; (iv) the reporting by the reinsurance intermediary or agent to the reinsurer; (v) the MGUs or ceding company's adjustment and payment of the loss; and (vi) the payment to the MGU or ceding company by the reinsurer. During this time, the insurer or reinsurer invests the premiums, earns investment income and generates net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on investments.

     Reportable Segments 
 We classify our business into four reportable segments: Global Property, Global A&H, Specialty & Casualty and Runoff & Other. The following discussion summarizes the business written by each of Sirius Group's segments. 
   Global Property
Global Property consists of Sirius Group's underwriting lines of business which offer other property insurance and reinsurance, property catastrophe excess reinsurance, and agriculture reinsurance on a worldwide basis. The following provides details of Global Property by product line: 
  Other Property Insurance and ReinsuranceSirius Group participates in the broker market for property reinsurance treaties written on a proportional and excess of loss basis. For Sirius Group's international business, the book consists of treaty, written on both a proportional and excess of loss basis, facultative, and primary business, primarily in Europe, Asia and Latin America. In the United States, the book predominantly centers on significant participations on proportional and excess of loss treaties mostly in the excess and surplus lines of the market. 
  Property Catastrophe Excess ReinsuranceProperty catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance treaties covers losses from catastrophic events. Sirius Group writes a worldwide book with the largest concentration of exposure in Europe and the United States. The U.S. book written in Bermuda has a national account focus supporting principally the lower and/or middle layers of large capacity programs. Additionally, the Stockholm branch writes a U.S. book mainly consisting of select small regional and standard lines carriers. The exposures written in the international book are diversified across many countries, regions, perils and layers. 
  AgricultureSirius Group provides stop-loss reinsurance coverage to companies writing U.S. government-sponsored multi-peril crop insurance ("MPCI"). Sirius Group's participation is net of the government's stop-loss reinsurance protection. Sirius Group also provides coverage for crop-hail and certain named perils when bundled with MPCI business. Sirius Group also writes agriculture business outside of the United States. 
   Global A&H
The Global A&H operating segment consists of Sirius Group's insurance, reinsurance, and MGUs units (which include Armada and IMG) that offer accident and health products on a worldwide basis: 
  Accident and Health insurance and reinsuranceSirius Group is an insurer of accident and health insurance business in the United States, either on an admitted or surplus lines basis, as well as international business written through wholly-owned IMG. Armada business is written on an admitted basis. Sirius Group also writes proportional and excess reinsurance treaties covering employer medical stop-loss for per person (specific) and per employer (aggregate) exposures. In addition, Sirius Group writes some medical, health, travel and personal accident coverages written on a treaty, facultative and primary basis. 
   Specialty & Casualty
Specialty & Casualty consists of Sirius Group's insurance and reinsurance underwriting units which offer specialty & casualty product lines on a worldwide basis. Specialty lines represent unique risks where the more difficult and unusual risks are underwritten, and much of the market is characterized by a high degree of specialization. The following provides details of Specialty & Casualty by product line: 
 Aviation & Space provides aviation insurance that covers loss of or damage to an aircraft and the aircraft operations' liability to passengers, cargo and hull as well as to third parties. Additionally, liability arising out of non-aircraft operations such as hangars, airports and aircraft products can be covered. Space insurance primarily covers loss of or damage to a satellite during launch and in orbit. The book consists of treaty, written on both a proportional and excess of loss basis, facultative and primary business. 
 Marine provides marine reinsurance, primarily written on an excess of loss and proportional basis. Coverage offered includes damage to ships and goods in transit, marine liability lines, and offshore energy industry insurance. Sirius Group also writes yacht business, both on reinsurance and a primary basis. The marine portfolio is diversified across many countries and regions. Starting in 2018, Sirius Group decided not to renew the book written in Sirius International's London office due to underwriting performance. 
 6

   Trade credit writes credit and bond reinsurance worldwide. The bulk of the business is traditional short-term commercial credit insurance, covering pre-agreed domestic and export sales of goods and services with typical coverage periods of 60 to 120 days. Losses under these policies are correlated to adverse changes in a respective country's gross national product. 
 Contingency writes insurance for event cancellation and non-appearance, primarily on a primary policy and facultative reinsurance basis. Additionally, coverage for liabilities arising from contractual bonus, prize redemption and over-redemption is also offered. The contingency portfolio is diversified across many countries and regions. In August 2018, Sirius Group decided not to renew the book written in Sirius International's London office due to underwriting performance. 
 Casualty represents a cross section of all casualty lines, including general liability, umbrella, auto, workers compensation, professional liability, and other specialty classes, written on a proportional, excess of loss, and primary basis. Sirius Group re-entered the broker market for U.S. casualty reinsurance treaties written on a proportional and excess of loss basis in 2017. In addition, Sirius Group began writing primary Casualty insurance in the U.S. in mid-2018. 
 Surety underwrites commercial surety bonds, including non-construction contract bonds, in a broad range of business segments in the U.S. 
 Environmental underwrites a pure environmental insurance book in the U.S. consisting of four core products that revolve around pollution coverage, which are premises pollution liability, contractor's pollution liability, contractor's pollution and professional liability. 
   Runoff & Other
Runoff & Other consists of asbestos risks, environmental risks and other long-tailed liability exposures, and results from Sirius Global Solutions including the acquisition and management of runoff liabilities for insurance and reinsurance companies, both in the United States and internationally.

  Marketing and Distribution 
 For reinsurance business, Sirius Group obtains most of its submissions from reinsurance intermediaries that represent the ceding company. The process of placing an intermediary reinsurance program typically begins when a ceding company enlists the aid of a reinsurance intermediary in structuring a reinsurance program. The ceding company and the reinsurance intermediary will often consult with one or more lead reinsurers as to the pricing and contract terms for the reinsurance protection being sought. Once the ceding company has approved the terms quoted by the lead reinsurer, the reinsurance intermediary will offer participation to qualified reinsurers until the program is fully subscribed. Sirius Group considers both the reinsurance intermediary and the ceding company to be its clients. Sirius Group believes it has developed strong business relationships over a long period of time with the management of many of its ceding companies and reinsurance intermediaries.

Sirius Group pays ceding companies a ceding commission under most proportional reinsurance treaties and some excess of loss reinsurance treaties. The ceding commission is generally based on the ceding company's cost of acquiring and administering the business being reinsured (e.g., agent commissions, premium taxes and certain miscellaneous expenses). The ceding commissions paid to ceding companies constitute the majority of Sirius Group's total acquisition costs. Additionally, Sirius Group pays reinsurance intermediaries commissions based on negotiated percentages of the premium they produce on a per treaty or certificate basis. 
 For primary insurance business, mostly Global A&H, Sirius Group enters into agreements with select MGUs, who then market Sirius Group's insurance products to the general public and have underwriting authority on its behalf. Sirius Group has narrowly defined underwriting standards in place for these MGUs that are closely monitored by Sirius Group staff. Sirius Group pays certain MGUs profit commissions based upon the underwriting profit business produced. In addition to the day-to-day interactions that Sirius Group has with its MGUs, audits are performed on a regular basis. These high-retention, long-term partnerships generate significant premium, and create alignment with the MGUs as they retain a share of underwriting results. Sirius Group has also acquired two MGUs, IMG and Armada, in recent years.

  Policies with Respect to Certain Activities 
 The following is a discussion of our underwriting and pricing, claims management, catastrophe risk management, and reinsurance protection policies. 
   Underwriting and Pricing 
 Sirius Group seeks to maintain a disciplined underwriting strategy which, while considering overall exposure, focuses on writing more business when market terms and conditions are favorable and reducing business volume during soft markets when terms and conditions become less favorable. Sirius Group offers clients a wide range of insurance and reinsurance products across multiple lines of business to satisfy risk management needs. 
 Sirius Group derives its reinsurance business from a broad spectrum of ceding companies, including national, regional, specialty, and excess and surplus lines writers, both internationally and in the United States. Sirius Group derives its primary insurance business mostly for Global A&H through several MGUs, which source business internationally and in the United States. Sirius Group prices its products by assessing the desired return on the expected capital needed to write a given contract and on the expected underwriting results of the contract. Sirius Group's pricing indications are based on a number of underwriting factors including historical results, analysis of exposure and estimates of future loss costs, a review of other programs displaying similar exposure characteristics and the MGUs or ceding company's underwriting and claims experience. Additionally, in the United States, Sirius Group's underwriters, actuaries and claims personnel perform audits of all MGUs and certain ceding companies. Generally, ceding company audits are not customary outside the United States. 
 Reinsurers do not have the stringent regulations with respect to contract terms and policy exclusions that are generally imposed on primary insurers. For example, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act in the United States is not applicable to reinsurers. As a result, terrorism exclusions on reinsurance contracts are dictated by the marketplace. Sirius Group evaluates terrorism exposure from its ceding companies and applies exclusions as it deems appropriate and as permitted by market conditions. Reinsurance on U.S. commercial risks written by Sirius Group subsequent to the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001 generally contains clauses that exclude acts of terrorism certified under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. Reinsurance on personal risks written by Sirius Group subsequent to the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001 generally contains exclusions related to nuclear, biological, radiological and chemical attacks.

     Claims Management 
 Sirius Group maintains a staff of experienced insurance and reinsurance claim specialists. Sirius Group's claims specialists work closely with reinsurance intermediaries, MGUs and insureds to obtain specific claims information on reported matters to properly adjust and resolve each matter. Where customary or appropriate, Sirius Group's claims staff performs selective on-site claim reviews to assess an MGUs claim handling abilities and, where customary or appropriate, a ceding company's claim handling abilities and reserve techniques. In addition, Sirius Group's claims specialists review loss information provided by ceding companies and MGUs for adequacy and accuracy. The results of these claim reviews are shared with the underwriters and actuaries to assist them in pricing products and establishing loss reserves. 
 Sirius Group also uses third-party administrators ("TPAs") for certain claims, including claims arising from certain Runoff & Other claims related to certain acquired companies. Sirius Group's claims staff performs on-site claim audits of certain TPAs to ensure the propriety of the controls and processes over claims serviced by the TPAs. 
   Catastrophe Risk Management 
 Sirius Group has exposure to catastrophe losses, mostly for Global Property, caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, winter storms, windstorms, floods, tsunamis, terrorist acts and other catastrophic events. In the normal course of business, Sirius Group regularly manages its concentration of exposures to catastrophic events, primarily by limiting concentrations of exposure to what it deems acceptable levels and, if necessary, purchasing reinsurance. In addition, Sirius Group seeks to limit losses that might arise from other extreme events such as terrorism, cyber or nuclear incidents, in its insurance and reinsurance contracts by exclusionary provisions where available. Sirius Group has significant exposure to windstorm, earthquake, wildfire, and flood events across the globe, primarily in North America, Europe, Asia (including Japan), Oceania, and Latin America. 
 Sirius Group licenses third-party global property catastrophe models from two of the leading vendors of industry-standard catastrophe modeling software, and also utilizes its own proprietary models to calculate expected PML estimates from various property natural catastrophe scenarios. Sirius Group prices its property catastrophe contracts using the aforementioned third-party software and internal models and other methods. Sirius Group also uses a proprietary property underwriting and pricing tool, referred to as ("GPI"), which consolidates and reports on all its worldwide property exposures. GPI is used to calculate individual and aggregate PMLs by combining multiple third-party and proprietary models, actuarial methods and underwriting judgement. For business that Sirius Group determines to have exposure to natural catastrophic perils, it models and assesses the exposure to quantify the appropriate premium for the exposure as part of its underwriting process. This includes property, accident and health, marine and casualty exposures. 
 The following table provides an estimate of Sirius Group's three largest PML zones on a per occurrence basis for 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 year events at January 1, 2019 as measured by net after-tax exposure.

   The proprietary GPI platform allows Sirius Group to choose either a third-party catastrophe modeling software or an internally developed model for PML reporting within each area and peril. The choice is based on a scientific, actuarial and underwriting assessment of the quality of the model by territory. If a third-party model is deemed to be qualitative overall but less strong in certain regards, Sirius Group may impose modifications on the model to mitigate any weaknesses. The third-party catastrophe modeling software provides new versions of their models on a periodic basis, usually annually for peak exposure zones. Sirius Group may implement these new versions for use in the underwriting and risk management process after having engaged in appropriate testing and achieving comfort with the model enhancements. 
 With GPI, the view of risk for each treaty can be further adjusted based on underwriting judgment regarding the specific exposures underlying each cedent's portfolio. This yields a final view of risk for each cedent. This view of risk is aggregated across Sirius Group's portfolio to an aggregated, simulated dataset from which PML estimates and any other portfolio metrics can be extracted. 
 Catastrophe modeling is dependent upon several broad scientific and economic assumptions. This includes fundamental assumptions on hazard frequency and intensity, assumptions on the vulnerability of different risks depending on their occupancy and building characteristics, assumptions on replacement values as well as assumptions on economic factors such as demand surge (the localized increase in prices of goods and services that often follows a catastrophe). Catastrophe modeling is inherently uncertain due to the significant uncertainties involved in estimating and quantifying these assumptions. Third-party modeling software does not provide information for all territories or perils for which Sirius Group writes business. Sirius Group uses its own proprietary models in these situations. 
 Sirius Group does not believe that it can rely solely upon catastrophe modeling to measure its exposure to natural catastrophe risk. For example, the losses arising from Hurricane Katrina for both Sirius Group and the industry were substantially in excess of losses previously predicted by third-party models from such an event. This was due to issues such as inadequate storm surge and demand surge assumptions in the models, as well as flooding from levees breaking, which was not fully contemplated in these models. Sirius Group monitors gross and net property catastrophe occurrence limits by country and region globally. Further, losses to a number of deterministic scenarios involving both natural and man-made catastrophes are estimated and tracked.

     Reinsurance Protection 
 In the normal course of business, Sirius Group seeks to protect its business from losses due to concentration of risk and loss arising from catastrophic events by reinsuring with third-party reinsurers. Sirius Group remains liable for risks reinsured in the event that the reinsurer does not honor its obligations under reinsurance contracts. The effects of reinsurance on Sirius Group's written and earned premiums and on losses and loss adjustment expenses ("LAE") for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: 

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​

Sirius Group's reinsurance protection primarily consists of pro-rata and excess of loss protections that protect all of its reportable segments. Attachment points and coverage limits vary by region around the world. 
 Sirius Group's core proportional property reinsurance programs provide protection for parts of the non proportional treaty accounts written in Europe, the Americas, Caribbean, Asia, the Middle East and Australia. These reinsurance protections are designed to increase underwriting capacity where appropriate, and to reduce exposure both to large catastrophe losses and to a frequency of smaller loss events. 
 Sirius Group has in place excess of loss retrocessional coverage for its worldwide earthquake related exposures. This coverage was renewed for one year at May 1, 2018, providing $40.0 million of reinsurance protection in excess of Sirius Group's retention of $35.0 million and a further $35.0 million of coverage in excess of $75.0 million. 
 Sirius Group periodically purchases industry loss warranties ("ILW") contracts to augment its overall retrocessional program. The following ILW contracts are currently in force: 

   
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
Scope | ​ | Limit | ​ | Trigger | ​ | Expiration Date
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
United States excluding North East, all natural perils | ​ | $5.0 million | ​ | $40.0 billion | ​ | July 5, 2019 
Europe, wind | ​ | $5.0 million | ​ | $7.5 billion | ​ | April 30, 2019 
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​

   Sirius Group purchases excess of loss reinsurance protection for its facultative and primary insurance property books. The protection was renewed at January 1, 2019 for business written in Stockholm, Hamburg and Singapore, providing $32.5 million of protection in excess of $2.5 million. For the business written by Syndicate 1945, an excess of loss reinsurance protection of $10.0 million in excess of retention of $5.0 million on a per risk basis was placed for 12 months at June 30, 2018. Due to reduced exposures, this was cancelled December 31, 2018 and not replaced. For catastrophe losses from business written by Syndicate 1945, Sirius Group has 50% of a $12.0 million protection in excess of retention of $3.0 million placed for 12 months at January 1, 2019. 
 Almost all of Sirius Group's excess of loss reinsurance protections, excluding ILWs which tend to only cover one loss event, include provisions that reinstate coverage at a cost of 100% or more of the original reinsurance premium. 
   Reinsurance Recoverables by Rating 
 At December 31, 2018, Sirius Group had reinsurance recoverables on paid losses of $55 million and reinsurance recoverables of $350 million on unpaid losses. At December 31, 2017, Sirius Group had reinsurance recoverables on paid losses of $18 million and reinsurance recoverables of $320 million on paid unpaid losses. Because retrocessional reinsurance contracts do not relieve Sirius Group of its obligation to its insureds, the ability to collect balances due from Sirius Group's reinsurers is important to its financial strength. Sirius Group monitors the financial strength and ratings of retrocessionaires on an ongoing basis. Uncollectible amounts historically have not been significant. 
 The following table provides a listing of Sirius Group's gross and net recoverable amounts by the reinsurer's Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC ("Standard & Poor's") rating and the percentage of total recoverables at December 31, 2018.

  Loss and LAE Reserves 
 Sirius Group establishes loss and LAE reserves that are estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses for events that have already occurred. The process of estimating reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and, as of any given date, is inherently uncertain. See Note 2 "Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesSignificant Accounting Policies" in Sirius Group's audited financial statements and "Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates" in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of loss and LAE reserves. 
 Sirius Group's net incurred losses from asbestos and environmental ("A&E") claims have totaled $183 million over the past ten years. Sirius Group's A&E exposure is primarily from reinsurance contracts written between 1974 through 1985 by acquired companies. The exposures are mostly higher layer excess of loss treaty and facultative coverages with relatively low limits exposed for each claim. The acquisition of companies having modest portfolios of A&E exposure has been typical of several prior Sirius Global Solutions transactions and is likely to be an element of at least some future acquisitions. However, the acquisition of new A&E liabilities is undertaken only after careful due diligence and utilizing conservative reserving assumptions in relation to industry benchmarks. In the case of portfolios acquired previously, the exposures arise almost entirely from old assumed reinsurance contracts having small limits of liability. See Note 5 "Reserves for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment ExpensesAsbestos and Environmental Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserve Activity" in Sirius Group's audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     Investments 
   Overview 
 Sirius Group's investment objective is to maximize the total return, including yield income and gains and losses, over the long term, without assuming risk to a degree which could jeopardize the vitality of Sirius Group's insurance franchise. This objective and associated policies and guidelines ("Investment Policy") are established by the Sirius Group Board of Directors. Certain relevant subsidiaries also approve policies and guidelines substantially similar to, and consistent with, the Sirius Group Investment Policy. The Investment Policy also provides that the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors ("Finance Committee") establishes and maintains a "statement of risk tolerance", approved no less frequently than annually, which further guides the portfolio, taking into account Sirius Group's Statement of Risk Tolerance, potential strategic endeavors, and the Finance Committee's near term view of market risks. 
 Sirius Group operates its investment portfolio under a number of constraints. The principal constraint is to ensure that Sirius Group is able to demonstrate to internal and external constituents that it is able, and will remain able, to pay insurance claims during, and after, periods of extreme volatility to its enterprisewhether such volatility arises from within its insurance business operations or investment portfolio. Such constituents include numerous regulatory regimes, rating agencies, Sirius Group's internally developed risk models and tolerances, and shareholder volatility and return expectations. 
 Finally, Sirius Group views its investment portfolio as a source of capital for strategic investments and acquisitions. Taking the above factors into consideration, the Investment Policy provides a cohesive framework to mitigate risk. It prescribes a number of thresholds under which the portfolio is intended to operate. For example, one provision is meant to ensure that the group shall at all times own cash and fixed income in an amount no less than 100% of property and casualty policyholder liabilities. 
 Investable assets in excess of policyholder liabilities and liquidity needs are available to be invested in equity securities, which may include common equity securities and other long-term investments, including hedge funds, private equity funds and direct investments in privately held common securities investments. From time to time, Sirius Group may also invest in exchange-traded funds ("ETFs") and mutual funds. Over the long term, Sirius Group expects that investments in a portfolio of equity securities and alternative investment classes will produce higher returns than investments in fixed income securities. 
 Sirius Group operates subsidiaries and branches located throughout the world. Its global footprint requires Sirius Group to transact in numerous currencies. Where practical, Sirius Group aims to generally match material liabilities with assets and in many cases investable assets. Further, due to regulatory requirements, its portfolio includes short term, fixed income and equity securities held in non-U.S. denominated currencies (mainly Swedish Krona ("SEK"), Euro ("EUR") and Canadian dollar ("CAD")) that may result in net long or short non-U.S. denominated balances ("Unmatched Currency"). From time to time, Sirius Group may utilize third party tools such as currency forwards or swaps to mitigate unmatched exposure or may choose to leave such exposure unmatched. In making this assessment, it considers foreign exchange markets, the interest rate environment including forward rates, counterparty risk and expenses. Sirius Group does not apply hedge accounting to currency swaps or forwards. 
 Sirius International's functional currency is the SEK. Sirius Group's portfolio of fixed-maturity investments and equity securities held for general investment purposes are classified as trading and are reported at fair value. Foreign exchange gains and losses on non-SEK investments are recorded as a component of net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses). For U.S. dollar investments held by Sirius International, Sirius Group would generally experience gains or losses of a similar nature going in the opposite direction as a component of comprehensive income. 
 Prior to Sirius Group's acquisition by CMIG International in April 2016, an affiliate of White Mountains managed the investment assets of Sirius Group to fit within the tolerances of White Mountains' consolidated investment and strategic objectives. Sirius Group had established separate accounts with third-party registered investment advisors to manage its publicly-traded equity securities and convertible fixed-maturity securities. In addition, Sirius Group held meaningful investments in unconsolidated affiliates as well as select passive-equity-indexed exchange-traded funds. During 2016, in connection with the CMIG International acquisition, Sirius Group sold all of its holdings in unconsolidated affiliates, separate accounts and ETFs and redeployed proceeds mainly into fixed-income securities. However, Sirius Group believes that prudent levels of investments in equity securities and other long-term investments are likely to enhance total returns over the long-term. Subsequent to the CMIG International acquisition, Sirius Group has deployed into these asset classes at a measured pace with a focus on value oriented strategies.

As of December 31, 2018, Sirius Group's invested assets consisted of securities and other investments held for general investment purposes. Sirius Group's portfolio of fixed-maturity investments and equity securities held for general investment purposes are classified as trading and are reported at fair value as of the balance sheet date. Changes in unrealized gains and losses are reported pre-tax in revenues. Realized investment gains and losses are accounted for using the first-in first-out method and are reported pre-tax in revenues. Premiums and discounts on all fixed-maturity investments are amortized and accreted to net investment income over the anticipated life of the investment. 
 Sirius Group's invested assets that are measured at fair value include fixed-maturity investments, common and preferred equity securities, convertible fixed-maturity and preferred investments, and other long-term investments, such as interests in hedge funds and private equities. In determining its fair value estimates, Sirius Group uses a variety of valuation approaches and inputs. Sirius Group estimates fair value using valuation methods that maximize the use of quoted prices and other observable inputs.

  Competition and Peers 
 The worldwide insurance and reinsurance markets are highly competitive. Competition is influenced by a variety of factors, including price charged and other terms and conditions offered, financial strength ratings, prior history and relationships, as well as expertise and the speed at which the company has historically paid claims. 
 Sirius Group competes for business in Europe, Bermuda, the United States and other international markets with numerous global competitors. Its competitors include other insurance and reinsurance companies and underwriting syndicates at Lloyd's of London, as well as London Market Companies. Some of the companies that Sirius Group competes with directly include Alleghany Corporation, Arch Capital Group Ltd., Aspen Insurance Holdings Ltd., Axis Capital Holdings Ltd., Everest Re Group, Ltd., General Reinsurance Corporation, Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd., Hannover Ruckversicherung AG, Munich Re Group, Odyssey Re Holdings Corp., PartnerRe Ltd., RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd., Scor Global P&C, Swiss Re Group and Third Point Reinsurance Ltd. While some of these competitors have greater revenue and shareholders' equity than Sirius Group, management believes that Sirius Group is well-suited to compete against its peers. 
 17

   In addition, in recent years the persistent low interest rate environment and ease of entry into the reinsurance sector has led to increased competition from non-traditional sources of capital, such as insurance-linked funds or collateralized special purpose insurers, predominantly in the property catastrophe excess reinsurance market. This alternative capital provides collateralized property catastrophe protection in the form of catastrophe bonds, industry loss warranties and other risk-linked products that facilitate the ability for non-reinsurance entities, such as hedge funds and pension funds, to compete for property catastrophe excess reinsurance business outside of the traditional treaty market. As a result, Sirius Group has observed reduced pricing and/or reduced shares in certain property catastrophe excess markets, as well as certain other markets. 
   Seasonality 
 Sirius Group's segments experience some seasonality with regard to quarterly recognition of premiums written, which are generally highest in the first quarter and lowest during the fourth quarter. We expect this trend to continue in the future. 
 Regulation 
 The business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in all countries in which Sirius Group operates, although the degree and type of regulation varies from one jurisdiction to another. As a holding company, Sirius Group is generally not directly subject to such regulations, but its various insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries are subject to regulation, as summarized below. 
 Bermuda Insurance Regulation 
   Insurance Regulation Generally 
 The Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and related regulations, as amended (the "Insurance Act"), regulates the insurance businesses of Sirius Bermuda, and other Bermuda operating companies, including Alstead Reinsurance Ltd. and the Bermuda branch of Sirius International (together, the "Bermuda Operating Companies"), and provides that no person may carry on any insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer under the Insurance Act by the BMA. 
 The BMA, in deciding whether to grant registration, has broad discretion to act as it thinks fit in the public interest. The BMA is required by the Insurance Act to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and, in particular, whether it has, or has available to it, adequate knowledge and expertise to operate an insurance business. 
 The Insurance Act does not distinguish between insurers and reinsurers: companies are registered under the Insurance Act as "insurers." The Insurance Act uses the defined term "insurance business" to include reinsurance business. 
 The continued registration of an applicant as an insurer is subject to the applicant complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the BMA may impose from time to time. The Insurance Act also grants to the BMA powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. 
 Each of the Bermuda Operating Companies has the ability to declare or pay dividends or make capital distributions during any 12-month period without the prior approval of Bermuda regulatory authorities on the condition that any such declaration or payment of dividends or capital distributions does not cause a breach of any of its regulatory solvency and liquidity requirements. 
 The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards on Bermuda insurance companies, as well as auditing and reporting requirements. In addition, the BMA confirmed in March 2016 that it will act as the group supervisor for Sirius Group and has designated Sirius Bermuda as the designated insurer for group supervisory purposes ("Designated Insurer"). Therefore, Sirius Group is subject to the BMA's group supervision and solvency rules which cover assessing the financial situation and solvency position of Sirius Group and regulating intra-Group transactions, risk concentration, governance procedures, risk management and regulatory reporting and disclosure. See "Regulation of Sirius GroupBermuda Insurance RegulationGroup Supervision" below for further discussion. 
 Certain significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth below, focusing only on Sirius Group's primary Class 4 insurer, Sirius Bermuda, which is subject to the strictest regulation out of the Bermuda Operating Companies. 
 18

     Classification of Insurers 
 The Insurance Act distinguishes between insurers carrying on long-term business, insurers carrying on general business and insurers carrying on special purpose business. There are six general business classifications (Classes 1, 2, 3, 3A, 3B and 4), five long-term business classifications (Classes A, B, C, D and E) and one classification for special purpose insurers. 
 Classification as a Class 4 Insurer; Minimum Paid Up Share Capital 
 A body corporate is registrable as a Class 4 insurer where (i) it has at the time of its application for registration, or will have before it carries on insurance business, a total statutory capital and surplus of not less than $100,000,000; and (ii) it intends to carry on general insurance business including excess liability business or property catastrophe reinsurance business. 
 Sirius Bermuda is required to maintain fully paid-up share capital of at least $1 million. 
   Principal Representative 
 As a Class 4 insurer, Sirius Bermuda is required to maintain a principal office and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda. 
 Without a reason acceptable to the BMA, an insurer may not terminate the appointment of its principal representative, and the principal representative may not cease to act as such, unless 30 days' notice in writing to the BMA is given of the intention to do so. 
 It is the duty of the principal representative to forthwith notify the BMA where the principal representative reaches the view that there is a likelihood of the insurer becoming insolvent, or upon becoming aware that a reportable "event" has occurred, or is believed to have occurred. Examples of a reportable "event" include a failure by the insurer to comply substantially with a condition imposed upon it by the BMA relating to a solvency margin or a liquidity or other ratio, a significant loss reasonably likely to cause the insurer to fail to comply with its enhanced capital requirement (discussed below) and the occurrence of a "material change" (as such term is defined under the Insurance Act) in its business operations. 
 Where there has been a significant loss which is reasonably likely to cause the insurer to fail to comply with its enhanced capital requirement, the principal representative must also furnish the BMA with a capital and solvency return reflecting an enhanced capital requirement prepared using post-loss data. 
 Furthermore, where a notification has been made to the BMA regarding a material change, the principal representative must furnish the BMA with unaudited interim statutory financial statements in relation to such period as the BMA may require. 
   Loss Reserve Specialist 
 As a Class 4 insurer, Sirius Bermuda is required to appoint an individual approved by the BMA to be its loss reserve specialist. In order to qualify as an approved loss reserve specialist, the applicant must be an individual qualified to provide an opinion in accordance with the requirements of the Insurance Act and the BMA must be satisfied that the individual is fit and proper to hold such an appointment. 
 Sirius Bermuda is required to submit annually an opinion of its approved loss reserve specialist with its capital and solvency return in respect of its total general business insurance technical provisions (i.e. the aggregate of its net premium provisions, net loss and loss expense provisions and risk margin, as each is reported in the insurer's statutory economic balance sheet). The loss reserve specialist's opinion must state, among other things, whether or not the aggregate amount of technical provisions shown in the statutory economic balance sheet as at the end of the relevant financial year (i) meets the requirements of the Insurance Act and (ii) makes reasonable provision for the total technical provisions of the insurer under the terms of its insurance contracts and agreements. 
   Annual Financial Statements 
 Sirius Bermuda prepares and submits, on an annual basis, audited GAAP financial statements and audited statutory financial statements. 
 19

   The Insurance Act prescribes rules for the preparation and substance of statutory financial statements (which include, in statutory form, a balance sheet, an income statement, a statement of capital and surplus and notes thereto). The statutory financial statements include detailed information and analysis regarding premiums, claims, reinsurance and investments of the insurer. 
 Sirius Bermuda is also required to prepare and submit to the BMA financial statements which have been prepared under GAAP or international financial reporting standards ("IFRS financial statements") with Sirius Bermuda filing GAAP financial statements. The insurer's annual GAAP financial statements and the auditor's report thereon, and the statutory financial statements are required to be filed with the BMA within four months from the end of the relevant financial year (unless specifically extended with the approval of the BMA). 
 The statutory financial statements do not form a part of the public records maintained by the BMA but the GAAP financial statements are available for public inspection. 
   Annual Statutory Financial Return and Annual Capital and Solvency Return 
 As a Class 4 insurer, Sirius Bermuda is required to file with the BMA a statutory financial return no later than four months after its financial year end. The statutory financial return includes, among other matters, the statutory financial statements and the calculations for the Class 4 insurer's minimum solvency margin and liquidity ratio. 
 In addition, each year Sirius Bermuda is required to file with the BMA a capital and solvency return along with its annual statutory financial return. Sirius Group has published its financial condition report as of December 31, 2017 which contains the minimum solvency margin and enhanced capital requirement of Sirius Group together with those of its Bermudian subsidiaries including Sirius Bermuda. 
   Declaration of Compliance 
 At the time of filing its statutory financial statements, a Class 4 insurer is also required to deliver to the BMA a declaration of compliance, in such form and with such content as may be prescribed by the BMA, declaring whether or not the Class 4 insurer has, with respect to the preceding financial year (i) complied with all requirements of the minimum criteria applicable to it; (ii) complied with the minimum margin of solvency as at its financial year end; (iii) complied with the applicable enhanced capital requirements as at its financial year end; and (iv) observed any limitations, restrictions or conditions imposed upon issuance of its license, if applicable. 
 Public Disclosures 
 Pursuant to the Insurance Act, all commercial insurers and insurance groups are required to prepare and file with the BMA, and also publish on their website, a financial condition report. 
 The BMA has discretion to approve modifications and exemptions to the public disclosure rules, on application by the insurer if, among other things, the BMA is satisfied that the disclosure of certain information will result in a competitive disadvantage or compromise confidentiality obligations of the insurer. 
   Non-insurance Business 
 No Class 4 insurer may engage in non-insurance business, unless that non-insurance business is ancillary to its core business. Non-insurance business means any business other than insurance business and includes carrying on investment business, managing an investment fund as operator, carrying on business as a fund administrator, carrying on banking business, underwriting debt or securities or otherwise engaging in investment banking, engaging in commercial or industrial activities and carrying on the business of management, sales or leasing of real property. 
 Minimum Liquidity Ratio 
 The Insurance Act provides a minimum liquidity ratio for general business insurers. A Class 4 insurer engaged in general business is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than 75% of the amount of its relevant liabilities. Relevant assets include cash and time deposits, quoted investments, unquoted bonds and debentures, first liens on real estate, investment income due and accrued, accounts and premiums receivable, reinsurance balances receivable, funds held by ceding reinsurers and any other assets which the BMA, on application in any particular case made to it with reasons, accepts in that case. 
 20

   The relevant liabilities are total general business insurance reserves and total other liabilities less deferred income taxes and letters of credit, guarantees and other instruments. 
   Minimum Solvency Margin and Enhanced Capital Requirements 
 Sirius Bermuda is required to maintain available statutory economic capital and surplus at a level equal to or in excess of its enhanced capital requirement ("ECR"), which is established by reference to either a model based on the BMA's prescribed form of capital and solvency return (known as the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement or "BSCR") or an approved internal capital model. 
 The BSCR model is a risk-based capital model which provides a method for determining a Class 4 insurer's capital requirements (statutory economic capital and surplus) by taking into account the risk characteristics of different aspects of the Class 4 insurer's business. The BSCR formula establishes capital requirements for ten categories of risk: fixed-income investment risk, equity investment risk, interest rate/liquidity risk, currency risk, concentration risk, premium risk, reserve risk, credit risk, catastrophe risk and operational risk. For each category, the capital requirement is determined by applying factors to asset, premium, reserve, creditor, probable maximum loss and operation items, with higher factors applied to items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items. 
 While not specifically referred to in the Insurance Act, the BMA has also established a target capital level ("TCL") for each Class 4 insurer equal to 120% of its ECR. The TCL serves as an early warning tool for the BMA, and failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the TCL will likely result in increased regulatory oversight. 
 If Sirius Bermuda at any time fails to meet its applicable enhanced capital requirement, it shall, upon becoming aware of that failure, immediately notify the BMA and promptly file with the BMA a written report containing particulars of the circumstances leading to the failure and a plan detailing the manner in which the Class 4 insurer intends to rectify the failure and furnish the BMA with (i) unaudited statutory economic balance sheets and unaudited interim statutory financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP covering such period as the BMA may require; (ii) the opinion of a loss reserve specialist in relation to total general business insurance technical provisions as set out in the economic balance sheet, where applicable; (iii) a general business solvency certificate in respect of the financial statements; and (iv) a capital and solvency return reflecting an enhanced capital requirement prepared using post failure data where applicable. 
 A Class 4 insurer is required to have general business assets that exceed the value of its general business liabilities by an amount prescribed by the Insurance Act, as its Minimum Solvency Margin ("MSM"). The MSM that a Class 4 insurer is required to maintain with respect to its general business is the greater of (i) U.S. $100 million, or (ii) 50% of net premiums written (with a credit for reinsurance ceded not exceeding 25% of gross premiums), or (iii) 15% of the aggregate of net loss and loss expense provisions and other reinsurance reserves, or (iv) 25% of the ECR as reported at the end of the relevant year. 
 If at any time a Class 4 insurer fails to meet its MSM requirements, it must, upon becoming aware of such failure, immediately notify the BMA and promptly file a written report with the BMA containing particulars of the circumstances that gave rise to the failure and setting out its plan detailing the manner in which the Class 4 insurer intends to rectify the failure. 
   Eligible Capital 
 A Class 4 insurer is required to disclose the makeup of its capital in accordance with the "3-tiered eligible capital system". Under this system, all of the Class 4 insurer's capital instruments will be classified as either basic or ancillary capital which in turn will be classified into one of three tiers based on their "loss absorbency" characteristics. Highest quality capital will be classified as Tier 1 Capital, and lesser quality capital will be classified as either Tier 2 Capital or Tier 3 Capital. Under this regime, up to certain specified percentages of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital may be used to support the Class 4 insurer's MSM, ECR and TCL. 
 Code of Conduct 
 The Insurance Code of Conduct (the "Code of Conduct") prescribes the duties, standards, procedures and sound business principles that must be complied with by all insurers registered under the Insurance Act. The BMA will assess an insurer's compliance with the Code of Conduct in a proportional manner relative to the nature, scale and complexity of its business. 
 21

     Cancellation of Insurer's Registration 
 An insurer's registration may be cancelled by the BMA at the request of the insurer or on certain grounds specified in the Insurance Act. For example, such grounds include a failure by the insurer to comply with its obligations under the Insurance Act or where the BMA believes that the insurer has not been carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance principles. 
   Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions 
 A Class 4 insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if it is in breach of its MSM, ECR or minimum liquidity ratio, or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause such a breach. Where an insurer fails to meet its MSM or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year, it will be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the approval of the BMA. 
 In addition, a Class 4 insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its previous financial year's statutory balance sheet) unless it files with the BMA an affidavit signed by at least two directors and the principal representative stating that it will continue to meet its solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio. 
   Reduction of Capital 
 No Class 4 insurer may reduce its total statutory capital by 15% or more, as set out in its previous year's financial statements, unless it has received the prior approval of the BMA. Total statutory capital consists of the insurer's paid in share capital, its contributed surplus and any other fixed capital designated by the BMA as statutory capital. 
 A Class 4 insurer seeking to reduce its statutory capital by 15% or more, as set out in its previous year's financial statements, is also required to submit an affidavit signed by at least two directors and the principal representative stating that the proposed reduction will not cause the insurer to fail its relevant margins and such other information as the BMA may require. 
   Supervision, Investigation, Intervention and Disclosure 
 The BMA may, by notice in writing served on a registered person or a designated insurer, require the registered person or designated insurer to provide such information and/or documentation as the BMA may reasonably require with respect to matters that are likely to be material to the performance of its supervisory functions under the Insurance Act. In addition, it may require such person's auditor, underwriter, accountant or any other person with relevant professional skill of such registered person or designated insurer to prepare a report on any aspect pertaining thereto. In the case of a report, the person so appointed shall immediately give the BMA written notice of any fact or matter of which he becomes aware or which indicates to him that any condition attaching to his registration under the Insurance Act is not or has not or may not be or may not have been fulfilled and that such matters are likely to be material to the performance of its functions under the Insurance Act. If it appears to the BMA to be desirable in the interests of the clients of a registered person or relevant insurance group, the BMA may also exercise these powers in relation to subsidiaries, parent companies and other affiliates of the registered person or designated insurer. 
 Where the BMA suspects that a person has failed to properly register under the Insurance Act or that a registered person or designated insurer has failed to comply with a requirement of the Insurance Act or that a person is not, or is no longer, a fit and proper person to perform functions in relation to a regulated activity, it may, by notice in writing, carry out an investigation into such person (or any other person connected thereto). In connection therewith, the BMA may require every person who is or was a controller, officer, employee, agent, banker, auditor, accountant, barrister and attorney or insurance manager to make a report and produce such documents in his care, custody and control and to attend before the BMA to answer questions relevant to the BMA's investigation and to take such actions as the BMA may direct. 
 22

   If it appears to the BMA that the business of the registered insurer is being conducted in a way that there is a significant risk of the insurer becoming insolvent or being unable to meet its obligations to policyholders, or that the insurer is in breach of the Insurance Act or any conditions imposed upon its registration, or the minimum criteria stipulated in the Insurance Act is not or has not been fulfilled in respect of a registered insurer, or that a person has become a controller without providing the BMA with the appropriate notice or in contravention of a notice of objection, or the registered insurer is in breach of its ECR, or that a designated insurer is in breach of any provision of the Insurance Act or the regulations or rules applicable to it, the BMA may issue such directions as it deems desirable for safeguarding the interests of policyholders or potential policyholders of the insurer or the insurance group, including but not limited to, restricting business activities, investments and dividends. 
   Fit and Proper Controllers 
 The BMA maintains supervision over the controllers of all registered insurers in Bermuda. 
 A controller includes (i) the managing director of the registered insurer or its parent company; (ii) the chief executive of the registered insurer or of its parent company; (iii) a shareholder controller; and (iv) any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the registered insurer or of its parent company are accustomed to act. 
 The definition of shareholder controller is set out in the Insurance Act but generally refers to (i) a person who holds 10% or more of the shares carrying rights to vote at a shareholders' meeting of the registered insurer or its parent company, or (ii) a person who is entitled to exercise 10% or more of the voting power at any shareholders' meeting of such registered insurer or its parent company, or (iii) a person who is able to exercise significant influence over the management of the registered insurer or its parent company by virtue of its shareholding or its entitlement to exercise, or control the exercise of, the voting power at any shareholders' meeting. 
 The BMA may file a notice of objection to any person who has become a controller of any description where it appears that such person is not, or is no longer, a fit and proper person to be a controller of the registered insurer. Before issuing a notice of objection, the BMA is required to serve upon the person concerned a preliminary written notice stating the BMA's intention to issue formal notice of objection. Upon receipt of the preliminary written notice, the person served may, within 28 days, file written representations with the BMA which shall be taken into account by the BMA in making its final determination. Any person who continues to be a controller of any description after having received a notice of objection shall be guilty of an offence and/or subject to fine. 
 All registered insurers are required to give written notice to the BMA of a change in controller(s). 
   Notification of Material Changes 
 Registered insurers are required to give notice to the BMA of their intention to effect a material change within the meaning of the Insurance Act. Material changes include: the transfer or acquisition of insurance business; merger with or acquisition of another firm; acquisition of a controlling interest in an undertaking that is engaged in non-insurance business; outsourcing all or substantially all of the company's actuarial, risk management, compliance, underwriting or internal audit functions; transfer or expansion into another line of business or the outsourcing of an officer role. 
 Group Supervision 
 The BMA acts as group supervisor of Sirius Group and its subsidiaries (the "Regulatory Group") and has designated Sirius Bermuda as the Designated Insurer. 
 As group supervisor, the BMA performs a number of supervisory functions including (i) coordinating the gathering and dissemination of information which is of importance for the supervisory task of other competent authorities; (ii) carrying out a supervisory review and assessment of the Regulatory Group; (iii) carrying out an assessment of the Regulatory Group's compliance with the rules on solvency, risk concentration, intra-group transactions and good governance procedures; (iv) planning and coordinating, with other competent authorities, supervisory activities in respect of the Regulatory Group, both as a going concern and in emergency situations; (v) coordinating any enforcement action that may need to be taken against the Regulatory Group or any of its members; and (vi) planning and coordinating meetings of colleges of supervisors (consisting of insurance regulators) in order to facilitate the carrying out of the functions described above. 
 23

     Group Solvency and Group Supervision 
 The current supervision and solvency rules (together, "Group Rules") apply to the Regulatory Group so long as the BMA remains Sirius Group's group supervisor. Through the Group Rules, the BMA may take action which affects Sirius Group. A summary of the Group Rules is set forth below. 
 Approved Group Actuary 
 Sirius Bermuda, as Designated Insurer, is responsible for ensuring that the Regulatory Group appoints an individual approved by the BMA to be the group actuary. The group actuary must provide an opinion on the Regulatory Group's technical provisions as recorded in the group statutory economic balance sheet. 
 Annual Group Financial Statements 
 The Regulatory Group is required to prepare and submit, on an annual basis, financial statements prepared in accordance with either IFRS or GAAP, together with statutory financial statements. The financial statements must be audited annually by the Regulatory Group's approved auditor who is required to prepare an auditor's report thereon in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. In addition, the Regulatory Group must prepare statutory financial statements (which include, in statutory form, a group balance sheet, a group income statement, a group statement of capital and surplus, and notes thereto) in respect of the parent company of the Regulatory Group. The Designated Insurer is required to file with the BMA the group statutory financial statements and the audited group GAAP or IFRS financial statements for the Regulatory Group with the BMA within five months from the end of the relevant financial year (unless specifically extended). 
 Annual Insurance Group Statutory Financial Return and Annual Insurance Group Capital and Solvency Return 
 The Regulatory Group is required to prepare an annual group statutory financial return and an insurance group capital and solvency return. The group statutory financial return must consist of (i) an insurance group business solvency certificate; (ii) particulars of ceded reinsurance listing the top-ten unaffiliated reinsurers; (iii) any adjustments to the group financial statements in the form of a reconciliation of amounts reported as total assets, total liabilities, net income and total statutory capital and surplus; (iv) a list of non-insurance financial regulated entities owned by the Regulatory Group; and (v) particulars of qualifying members of the Regulatory Group. The group capital and solvency return shall include an annual opinion of the group actuary. Both the annual insurance group statutory financial return and the insurance group capital and solvency return must be submitted to the BMA by the Designated Insurer within five months after its financial year end (unless specifically extended). 
 Quarterly Group Financial Statements 
 The Designated Insurer is required to file quarterly financial returns for the Regulatory Group with the BMA on or before the last day of the months May, August and November of each year. The quarterly Regulatory Group financial returns consist of (i) quarterly unaudited (consolidated) financial statements for each financial quarter (which must minimally include a balance sheet and income statement and must also be recent and not reflect a financial position that exceeds two months) and (ii) a list and details of material intra-group transactions and risk concentrations, details surrounding all intra-group reinsurance and retrocession arrangements and details of the top-ten counterparties and any other counterparty exposures exceeding 10% of the Regulatory Group's statutory capital and surplus. 
 Public Disclosures 
 Pursuant to recent amendments to the Insurance Act all insurance groups are required to prepare and file with the BMA, and also publish on their website, a financial condition report. 
 24



Group Solvency Self-Assessment ("GSSA") 
 The Group Rules require the board of directors of the parent company of the insurance group (the "Parent Board") to establish solvency self-assessment procedures for the group that factors in all the foreseeable reasonably material risks. Such procedures should be carried out at least annually and assess the quality and quantity of the capital required to adequately cover the risks to which the insurance group is exposed. Such procedures must also be an integral part of the group's risk management framework and be reviewed and evaluated on a regular basis by the Parent Board. In particular, the GSSA should, among other things, demonstrate consideration of the relationship between risk management, the quality and quantity of capital resources, the impact of risk mitigation techniques and diversification and correlation effects between material risks; a description of the group's risk appetite; be forward-looking; include appropriate stress and scenario testing and appropriately reflect all assets and liabilities, material off-balance sheet arrangements, material intra group transactions, relevant managerial practices, systems and controls and a valuation basis that is aligned with the risk characteristics and business model of the group. 
 Group Minimum Solvency Margin ("Group MSM") and Group Enhanced Capital Requirement ("Group ECR") 
 An insurance group must ensure that the value of its total statutory group economic capital and surplus exceeds the aggregate of (i) the amount of the aggregate minimum margins of solvency of each qualifying member of the Regulatory Group controlled by the parent company, and (ii) the parent company's percentage shareholding in each member where it exercises significant influence over such member but does not control it. A member is a qualifying member of the Regulatory Group if it is subject to solvency requirements in the jurisdiction in which it is registered. The Group is also required to maintain available Group statutory economic capital and surplus in an amount that is at least equal to the Group ECR and the BMA has established a group target capital level equal to 120% of Group ECR. 
 Group Eligible Capital 
 The Designated Insurer is required to disclose the makeup of the Regulatory Group's capital in accordance with a 3-tiered eligible capital system. Under the eligible capital requirements, all of the Regulatory Group's capital instruments will be classified as either basic or ancillary capital which in turn will be classified into one of three tiers based on their "loss absorbency" characteristics. Highest quality capital will be classified Tier 1 Capital, lesser quality capital will be classified as either Tier 2 Capital or Tier 3 Capital. A minimum threshold of Tier 1 and maximum thresholds of Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital used to satisfy the Regulatory Group MSM and Regulatory Group ECR requirements are specified under the rules. 
 Group Governance 
 The Group Rules require the Parent Board to establish and effectively implement corporate governance policies and procedures, which it must be periodically review to ensure they continue to support the overall organizational strategy of the group. In particular, the Parent Board must:
  
 ensure that operational and oversight responsibilities of the group are clearly defined and documented and that the reporting of material deficiencies and fraudulent activities are transparent and devoid of conflicts of interest; 

 establish systems for identifying on a risk-sensitive basis those policies and procedures that must be reviewed annually and those policies and procedures that must be reviewed at other regular intervals; 

 establish a risk management and internal controls framework and ensure that it is assessed regularly and such assessment is reported to the Parent Board and the chief and senior executives; 

 establish and maintain sound accounting and financial reporting procedures and practices for the group; and 

 establish and keep under review group functions relating to actuarial, compliance, internal audit and risk management functions which must address certain specific requirements as set out in the Group Rules. 

 25

     Designated Insurer Notification Obligations 
 The Designated Insurer must notify the BMA upon reaching a view that there is a likelihood of the Regulatory Group or any member of the Regulatory Group becoming insolvent or that a reportable "event" is believed to have occurred. Examples of a reportable "event" include a failure by the Regulatory Group or any member of the Regulatory Group to comply substantially with a requirement imposed upon it under the Group Rules relating to its solvency position, governance and risk management or supervisory reporting and disclosures; failure by the Designated Insurer to comply with a direction given to it under the Insurance Act in respect of the group or any of its members; a criminal conviction imposed upon any member of the Regulatory Group whether in Bermuda or abroad; material breaches of any statutory requirements by any member of the Regulatory Group located outside of Bermuda that could lead to supervisory or enforcement action by a competent authority; or a significant loss that is reasonably likely to cause the Regulatory Group to be unable to comply with its Group ECR. The Designated Insurer must promptly furnish the BMA with a written report setting out the particulars of the case and furnish a Regulatory Group capital and solvency return that reflects the Group ECR that has been prepared using post-loss data and unaudited financial statements for such period as the BMA requires. 
 Certain Other Bermuda Law Considerations 
 Sirius Group is a Bermuda exempted company incorporated under the Companies Act. As a result, Sirius Group is required to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act regulating the payment of dividends and making of distributions from contributed surplus. A company is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend, or making a distribution out of contributed surplus, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that:
  
 The company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or 

 The realizable value of the company's assets would be less than its liabilities. 

 Under Sirius Group's bye-laws, each common share is entitled to dividends if, and when, dividends are declared by its board of directors, subject to any preferred dividend rights which may be held by the holders any preference shares. Issued share capital is the aggregate par value of the company's issued shares, and the share premium account is the aggregate amount paid for issued shares over and above their par value. Share premium accounts may be reduced in certain limited circumstances. In addition, the Companies Act regulates return of capital, reduction of capital and any purchase or redemption of shares by Sirius Group. 
 Although Sirius Group is incorporated in Bermuda, it has been designated as a nonresident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes by the BMA. Pursuant to its nonresident status, Sirius Group may hold any currency other than Bermuda dollars and convert that currency into any other currency, other than Bermuda dollars, without restriction. 
 Under Bermuda law, exempted companies are companies formed for the purpose of conducting business outside Bermuda from a principal place in Bermuda. All Bermuda exempted companies are exempt from certain Bermuda laws restricting the percentage of share capital that may be held by non-Bermudians. However, exempted companies may not participate in certain business transactions, including: (i) the acquisition or holding of land in Bermuda except that required for their business held by way of lease or tenancy for a term not exceeding 50 years or, with the consent of the Minister of Finance granted in his discretion, land by way of lease or tenancy for a term not exceeding 21 years in order to provide accommodation or recreational facilities for its officers and employees; (ii) the taking of mortgages on land in Bermuda to secure an amount in excess of BD$50,000 without the consent of the relevant Ministers; (iii) the acquisition of any bonds or debentures secured by any land in Bermuda, other than bonds or debentures issued by the Bermuda government or a public authority; or (iv) the carrying on of business of any kind in Bermuda, except in furtherance of their business carried on outside Bermuda or under license granted by the Minister of Finance. Generally, it is not permitted without a special license granted by the Minister to insure Bermuda domestic risks or risks of persons of, in or based in Bermuda. 
 On January 1, 2019 the Economic Substance Act 2018 (the "ESA") came into effect in Bermuda. Under the provisions of the ESA, every Bermuda registered entity engaged in a "relevant activity" must satisfy economic substance requirements by maintaining a substantial economic presence in Bermuda. Carrying on as a business either insurance or holding entity activities (both as defined in the ESA and Economic Substance Regulations 2018) are relevant activities under the ESA. To the extent that the ESA applies to any of our entities registered in Bermuda we will be required to demonstrate compliance with economic substance requirements by filing an annual economic substance declaration with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda.

     U.S. Insurance Regulation 
   State-Based Regulation 
 Sirius Group's U.S.-based insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision in each of the states where they are domiciled and where they are licensed to conduct business. Generally, state regulatory authorities have broad supervisory and administrative powers over such matters as licenses, standards of solvency, premium rates, policy forms, investments, statutory deposits, methods of accounting, form and content of financial statements, reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses, reinsurance, minimum capital and surplus requirements, dividends and other distributions to shareholders, annual and other report filings and market conduct. 
 Sirius Group's U.S.-based insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, and their respective domiciliary state regulators (the "Domiciliary States") are as follows:
  
 Sirius America Insurance Company (New York State Department of Financial Services); 

 Empire Insurance Company (New York State Department of Financial Services); 

 WRM America Indemnity Company (New York State Department of Financial Services); and 

 Oakwood Insurance Company (Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance). 

   State Accreditation and Monitoring 
 All state insurance regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over Sirius Group's U.S.-based insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are accredited by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"). Accredited states generally follow the model laws developed by the NAIC. However, there are jurisdictional differences that require reference to each state's insurance laws. States have laws establishing the standards that an insurer must meet to maintain its license to write business. In addition, all states, including the Domiciliary States, have enacted laws substantially similar to the NAIC's risk-based capital ("RBC") standards for property and casualty companies, which are designed to determine minimum capital requirements and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations. The RBC formula for property and casualty insurance companies measures three major areas of risk: 1) underwriting, which encompasses the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing; 2) declines in asset values arising from market and/or credit risk; and 3) off-balance sheet risk arising from adverse experience from non-controlled assets, guarantees for affiliates or other contingent liabilities and excessive premium growth. RBC reports are provided annually to state regulators as part of an insurer's financial reporting requirements. Insurers having less total adjusted capital than that required by the RBC calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. As of December 31, 2018, Sirius Group's U.S. domiciled subsidiaries exceeded all required RBC regulatory thresholds. The calculation of RBC requires certain judgments to be made, and, accordingly, the current RBC of Sirius Group's U.S. domiciled subsidiaries may be greater or less than the RBC calculated as of any date of determination. 
 The NAIC has a set of financial relationship tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special regulatory attention operating in their respective states. Insurance companies generally submit data annually to their domiciliary state regulator, which in turn analyzes the data using prescribed financial data ratios ("IRIS ratios"), each with defined "usual ranges". Generally, regulators will begin to investigate or monitor an insurance company if its IRIS ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. If an insurance company has insufficient capital, regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue or, in severe situations, assume control of the company. None of Sirius Group's U.S.-based (re)insurance subsidiaries is currently subject to regulatory scrutiny based on their respective IRIS ratios. 
 Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer's ability to exit a market. Some states also limit cancelling or non-renewing certain policies for specific reasons. State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing marketing and sales practices, policyholder services, claims management and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally test and enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations. These laws are applicable to certain types of primary insurance policies, but not applicable to reinsurance. 
 27

   The NAIC's Annual Financial Reporting Model Regulation, or the Model Audit Rule, which includes provisions that are similar to certain Sarbanes-Oxley requirements for public companies, requires certain insurance companies to appoint audit committees to oversee accounting and financial reporting processes as well as oversee the audit of the insurer's statutory financial statements. Audit committees also are required to appoint independent auditors, among other things. The appointed audit committee receives reports regarding significant deficiencies, material weaknesses and solvency concerns at the insurance company level. 
 States are adopting laws to strengthen the ability of regulators to understand and regulate the risk-management practices of insurers and insurance groups. For example, many states have adopted measures related to the NAIC's Solvency Modernization Initiative ("SMI"), pursuant to which the NAIC reviewed the U.S. financial regulatory system and all aspects of financial regulation affecting insurance companies. Among other things, the SMI resulted in the NAIC's adoption of the Risk Management and Own Risk Solvency Model Act ("ORSA Model Act"), which requires insurers meeting premium thresholds to: 1) maintain a risk-management framework; and 2) annually submit a comprehensive report ("ORSA Report") designed to assess the adequacy of an insurer's risk-management practices, including risks related to the insurer's future solvency position. The ORSA Report is required to be filed with the lead state regulator and made available to other domiciliary regulators within the holding company system. Each of the Domiciliary States has substantially adopted the ORSA Model Act, and Sirius Group's U.S.-based (re)insurance subsidiaries are in compliance with the ORSA Model Act as adopted by the Domiciliary States. 
   Holding Company Regulation 
 As a holding company, Sirius Group is subject to the state insurance holding company statutes as well as certain other laws of each of the Domiciliary States. The insurance holding company statutes generally require an insurance holding company and insurers that are members of such holding company system to register with their domestic insurance regulators and to file certain reports with those authorities, including information concerning their capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. 
 The NAIC's amended Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Model Act (the "Amended Holding Company Model Act"), addresses the concept of "enterprise risk" within an insurance holding company system and provides enhanced authority for states to regulate insurers as well as their affiliated entities and imposed more extensive informational requirements on parents and other affiliates of licensed insurers or reinsurers for the purpose of protecting licensed companies from enterprise risk. The Amended Holding Company Model Act requires the ultimate controlling person in an insurer's holding company structure to identify and annually report to state insurance regulators material risks within the structure that could pose enterprise risk to the insurer. Each of the Domiciliary States has substantially adopted the Amended Holding Company Model Act. 
   Acquisition of Control 
 Insurance holding company laws generally provide that no person or entity may acquire control of an insurance company, or a controlling interest in any parent company of an insurance company, without the prior approval of such insurance company's domiciliary state insurance regulator. Control is generally presumed to exist if any person acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company. This statutory presumption of control may be rebutted by showing that control does not exist in fact. Control may also be deemed to exist upon the possession of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of any person, whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. 
 To obtain approval of any acquisition of control, the proposed acquirer must file with the applicable insurance regulator an application disclosing, among other information, its background, financial condition, the financial condition of its affiliates, the source and amount of funds by which it will affect the acquisition, the criteria used in determining the nature and amount of consideration to be paid for the acquisition, proposed changes in the management and operations of the insurance company and other related matters. In considering an application to acquire control of an insurer, an insurance commissioner generally will consider such factors as the experience, competence and financial strength of the applicant, the integrity of the applicant's board of directors and executive officers, the acquirer's plans for the management and operation of the insurer, and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the acquisition. These regulations pertaining to an acquisition of control of an insurance company may impact a person or entity's ability to acquire Sirius Group, as well as Sirius Group's ability to acquire an insurance company. 
 28

     Guaranty Funds and Mandatory Shared Market Mechanisms 
 All states within the U.S. and the District of Columbia have insurance guaranty fund laws requiring insurance companies doing business within those jurisdictions to participate in guaranty associations. Sirius Group's U.S.-based insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries may be required to participate in guaranty associations to help pay the obligations of impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies to their policyholders and claimants. Such participation generally includes an assessment based on the premiums written by the insurer in such state applicable to particular lines of business. 
 Pricing, Investments and Dividends 
 Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring licensed property and casualty insurance companies to file their rates, rules and policy or coverage forms with the state's regulatory authority. In most cases, such rates, rules and forms must be approved prior to use. While pricing laws vary from state to state, their objectives are generally to ensure that rates are not excessive, unfairly discriminatory or used to engage in unfair price competition. The ability and timing of Sirius Group's U.S.-based (re)insurance subsidiaries to increase rates are dependent upon the regulatory requirements in each state where policies are sold. 
 Sirius Group's U.S.-based (re)insurance subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that dictate the quality, quantity and general types of investments they may hold. Non-compliance may cause non-conforming investments to be non-admitted when measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, may require divestiture. Sirius Group's investment/finance units continually monitor portfolio composition to ensure compliance with the investment rules applicable to each (re)insurance subsidiary. 
 Under the insurance laws of the Domiciliary States, an insurer is restricted with respect to the timing and the amount of dividends it may pay without prior approval by regulatory authorities. Under the current law of the State of Tennessee, where Oakwood Insurance Company ("Oakwood") is domiciled, an insurer has the ability, without the prior approval of the regulatory authority and subject to the availability of earned surplus, to pay dividends or make distributions which, together with dividends or distributions paid during the preceding twelve months, do not exceed the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of the immediately preceding year end or (ii) the net income of the insurer (excluding realized capital gains) for the preceding twelve-month period ending as of the immediately preceding year end. Under the current law of the State of New York, where Sirius America, Empire Insurance Company ("Empire"), and WRM America Indemnity Company ("WRM America") are domiciled, an insurer has the ability to pay dividends during any 12-month period without the prior approval of the regulatory authority in an amount set by a formula based on the lesser of adjusted net investment income, as defined by statute, or 10% of statutory surplus, in both cases as most recently reported to the regulatory authority, subject to the availability of earned surplus and subject to dividends paid in prior periods. The insurance laws and regulations of the Domiciliary States also require that an insurer's surplus as regards policyholders following any dividend or distribution be reasonable in relation to such insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs. 
 Based upon these formulas, as of December 31, 2018, Oakwood and Empire have dividend capacity without prior approval of the applicable regulatory authorities, while Sirius America and WRM America do not have dividend capacity without prior approval of the applicable regulatory authority. 
   U.S. Federal Regulation Affecting the Insurance Industry 
 Sirius Group's U.S.-based insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are not federally regulated, but they are impacted by other federal regulations targeted at the insurance and other industries. From time to time, federal measures are proposed that may significantly affect the insurance business, for example, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act provides a federal backstop to all U.S.-based property and casualty insurers for insurance-related losses resulting from any act of terrorism on U.S. soil or against certain U.S. air carriers, vessels or foreign mission. 
 The federal government also has issued certain orders and regulations that require Sirius Group's U.S.-based (re)insurance subsidiaries to establish certain internal controls. Most significant of these regulations is the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Asset Control ("OFAC"). OFAC proscribes transactions with specially designated nationals ("SDNs") and blocked countries due to ties with matters such as terrorism, drugs and money laundering. Insurance and reinsurance transactions with SDNs and blocked countries are prohibited and violation can result in significant fines. 
 29

   While the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd Frank Act") made sweeping changes to the regulation of financial services entities, products and markets. Numerous provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require the adoption or implementation of rules or regulations. The process of adopting such implementing rules and/or regulations has, in some instances, been delayed beyond the timeframes initially imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. Further, changes in general political, economic or market conditions, including as a result of the most recent U.S. presidential and congressional elections, could affect the scope, timing and final implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act. For example, in May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law, making significant changes to some provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The full impact of the regulations adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act on Sirius Group's U.S.-based (re)insurance subsidiaries remains unclear. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act established the Federal Insurance Office ("FIO") within the Treasury Department to monitor the insurance industry and certain lines of business. The FIO is designed principally to exercise a monitoring and information-gathering role, rather than a regulatory role. The Director of the FIO has submitted reports to Congress regarding (i) how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the U.S., (ii) the impact of Part II of the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010 and (iii) the global reinsurance market and the regulation of reinsurance. These activities could ultimately lead to changes in the regulation of certain insurers and reinsurers in the United States. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes the FIO to assist the Secretary of the Treasury Department in negotiating covered agreements. A covered agreement is an agreement between the U.S. and one or more foreign governments, authorities or regulatory entities, regarding prudential measures with respect to insurance or reinsurance. The FIO is further charged with determining, in accordance with the procedures and standards established under the Dodd-Frank Act, whether state laws are preempted by a covered agreement. Pursuant to this authority, in September 2017, the U.S. and the European Union signed a covered agreement (the "Covered Agreement") to address, among other things, reinsurance collateral requirements. U.S. state regulators have 60 months, or five years, to adopt reinsurance reforms removing reinsurance collateral requirements for European Union reinsurers that meet the Covered Agreement's prescribed minimum conditions or else state laws imposing such reinsurance collateral requirements may be subject to federal preemption. The NAIC is currently working to adopt amendments to the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation to conform to the requirements of the Covered Agreement. The reinsurance collateral provisions of the Covered Agreement may increase competition, in particular with respect to pricing for reinsurance transactions, by lowering the cost at which competitors are able to provide reinsurance to U.S. insurers. 
   Consumer Protection Laws and Privacy and Data Security Regulation 
 Federal and state laws and regulations require financial institutions, including insurers, to protect the security and confidentiality of nonpublic personal information, including certain health-related and customer information, and to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of health-related and customer information and their practices relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. State laws regulate use and disclosure of Social Security numbers and federal and state laws require notice to affected individuals, law enforcement, regulators and others if there is a breach of the security of certain nonpublic personal information, including Social Security numbers. Federal and state laws and regulations regulate the ability of financial institutions to make telemarketing calls and to send unsolicited email or fax messages to consumers and customers. 
 30

   Federal and state lawmakers and regulatory bodies may be expected to consider additional or more detailed regulation regarding these subjects and the privacy and security of nonpublic personal information. Furthermore, the issues surrounding data security and the safeguarding of consumers' protected information are under increasing regulatory scrutiny by state and federal regulators, particularly in light of the number and severity of recent U.S. companies' data breaches. The Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Communications Commission, the New York State Department of Financial Services, and the NAIC have undertaken various studies, reports and actions regarding data security for entities under their respective supervision. Some states have recently enacted new insurance laws that require certain regulated entities to implement and maintain comprehensive information security programs to safeguard the personal information of insureds and enrollees. The New York State Department of Financial Services published a cybersecurity regulation, which became effective on March 1, 2017, with ongoing compliance deadlines over a 24 month period, and which requires financial institutions regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services, including Sirius Group's U.S.-based (re)insurance subsidiaries, to establish a cybersecurity program. The regulation includes specific technical safeguards as well as requirements regarding governance, incident planning, data management, system testing and regulator notification. Sirius Group has taken steps to comply with the regulation in accordance with its implementation schedule. 
 Sirius Group expects cybersecurity risk management, prioritization and reporting to continue to be an area of significant regulatory focus by such regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations. Sirius Group cannot predict the effect or the compliance costs if state and federal regulators pursue investigations and increase the regulatory requirements for the security of protected information. 
   European Insurance Regulation 
 Businesses that carry out insurance activities in Europe are subject to extensive insurance laws and regulations, including prudential requirements and requirements relating to the manner in which insurance activities are conducted. These laws and regulations are generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, consumers and claimants, rather than investors. 
 Prudential regulation and supervision focuses on authorization, ownership and control, resourcing and capital adequacy, risk identification and management, and sound governance. Conduct regulation focuses on the manner in which an insurer or insurance intermediary conducts itself in relation to its interactions with customers. Businesses carrying out insurance activities are primarily regulated and supervised by government authorities within their home jurisdictions. 
 The European Solvency II regulatory framework for insurance business provides a single set of key prudential requirements that apply to insurance and reinsurance businesses operating within the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It imposes economic risk-based solvency requirements across all member states. The aim of the Solvency II framework is to ensure that insurance and reinsurance undertakings are financially sound and can withstand adverse events in order to protect policyholders and the stability of the financial system as a whole. It also aims at the creation of a single market for insurance in the EEA with consistent regulatory requirements and harmonized supervision. The Solvency II regulatory framework is categorized into three 'pillars', covering quantitative requirements, such as capital requirements designed to ensure that sufficient and appropriate assets are held to cover insurance liabilities and risk exposure (Pillar 1), qualitative requirements relating to governance and risk-management (Pillar 2), and transparency obligations requiring disclosure of extensive information to supervisors and to the public (Pillar 3). 
 The Solvency II framework is set out in a set of regulations headed by an EU Directive. It also includes Delegated Acts and Implementing Technical Standards adopted by the EU Commission and Guidelines issued by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority. These address issues that are more technical in nature and contain details on the valuation of assets and liabilities, eligibility of capital, risk transfer, equivalence, internal model, and rules relating to insurance groups. The Solvency II Directive is implemented into local laws and complemented by local regulations and guidelines. 
 31

   The Solvency II requirements in respect of insurance groups include group solvency and capital requirements, group disclosure and supervisory reporting, and undertaking a group own risk and solvency assessment. The Bermuda commercial insurance regulatory regime has been approved by the European Commission as being Solvency II equivalent. Therefore, the Solvency II group requirements are capped at the highest European entity, Sirius International UK Holdings Ltd. ("SIUK"). Accordingly, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (the "SFSA") is the group supervisor for the SIUK group and the BMA, has been designated as the group supervisor for the Sirius Group-level and below. As a consequence of the U.K. withdrawal from the European Union, Sirius Group is preparing for the Solvency II group requirements to apply to another holding company within the European group. 
 In addition to the Solvency II regime, there are a number of pan-European rules and regulations in relation to the distribution of insurance in the EEA. The Insurance Distribution Directive (EU/2016/97) was implemented in all EEA states by October 1, 2018. 
 The General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) ("GDPR") became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is intended to harmonize data protection procedures and enforcement across the EU and achieve consistency with the system for ensuring privacy online and it is directly applicable to data controllers and data processors in all member states. Many of the provisions of the GDPR will have a significant impact on data controllers and processors who are active within the EEA, and those who are located outside it. The penalties for breach of the new data protection regime and the insurance distribution directive are substantial. 
   Sweden Insurance Regulation 
 Sirius International is subject to regulation and supervision by the SFSA. As Sweden is a member of the EU, the SFSA supervision of branches is recognized across all locations within the EU (apart from customer conduct that is regulated and supervised locally across the EU). The SFSA has broad supervisory and administrative powers over such matters as licenses, governance and internal control, standards of solvency, investments, methods of accounting, form and content of financial statements, minimum capital and surplus requirements, and annual and other report filings. Non-compliance can be sanctioned by warnings, fees or withdrawal of license. 
 The Solvency II Directive is implemented in Sweden primarily through the Swedish Insurance Business Act (Sw. försäkringsrörelselag (2010:2043)) (the "IBA"). The "level two" implementation measures set out in the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 (the "Solvency II Regulation") have direct effect in Sweden. The IBA and the Solvency II Regulation constitute the main legal framework applicable to insurance business in Sweden. Supplementary company law for most insurance companies is provided in the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)). In addition, the SFSA issues regulations and general guidelines. 
 Insurance companies are obliged to provide, on an on-going basis, information about their financial status, and the SFSA may conduct on-site inspections and review the operations at any time. In addition to what is required under the Solvency II Regulation, Swedish insurance companies must conduct the business in accordance with "generally accepted insurance practices". A Swedish insurance company may not engage in business other than insurance business and activities that are connected with insurance business (such as claims handling, investment management, etc.). Sweden has implemented robust rules regarding the policies required and rules pertaining to conflicts of interest.

     Safety Reserve 
 Subject to certain limitations under Swedish law, Sirius International is permitted to transfer pre-tax income amounts into an untaxed reserve referred to as a "safety reserve". As of December 31, 2018, Sirius International's safety reserve amounted to SEK 10.7 billion, or $1.2 billion (based on the December 31, 2018 SEK to USD exchange rate). For the year ended December 31, 2018, Sirius International did not transfer any of its 2018 pre-tax income to the safety reserve. Under GAAP, an amount equal to the safety reserve, net of a related deferred tax liability established at the Swedish tax rate of 20.6%, is classified as shareholders' equity. Generally, this deferred tax liability is only required to be paid by Sirius International if it fails to maintain prescribed levels of premium writings and loss reserves in future years. As a result of the indefinite deferral of these taxes, Swedish regulatory authorities apply no taxes to the safety reserve when calculating solvency capital under Swedish insurance regulations. Under local statutory requirements, an amount equal to the deferred tax liability on Sirius International's safety reserve ($261 million as of December 31, 2018) is included in Sirius International's solvency capital. Access to the safety reserve is restricted to coverage of insurance and reinsurance losses and to a breach of the solvency capital requirement. Access for any other purpose requires the approval of Swedish regulatory authorities. Similar to the approach taken by Swedish regulatory authorities, most major rating agencies generally include the balance of the safety reserve, without any provision for deferred taxes, in Sirius International's regulatory capital when assessing Sirius International's financial strength. 
 Change of Control 
 The acquisition of a "qualifying holding" directly or indirectly in Sirius International requires approval from the SFSA prior to completion. "Qualifying holding" means:
  
 a direct or indirect ownership in an undertaking, where the holding represents 10% or more of the equity capital or of all voting participating interests; or 

 the ability to exercise a significant influence over the management of the undertaking (e.g. possible shareholder agreements which might have an impact on the influence over the undertaking) 

 In addition, approval from the SFSA must be obtained when the holding is increased so that the holding represents or exceeds 20%, 30% or 50% of the equity capital or of all voting participating interests, or when the company becomes a subsidiary. The same is valid if there is a decrease. When certain persons or companies act in concert, their holdings are aggregated to determine whether such persons or companies acquire a qualifying holding or cross any relevant threshold. 
 The SFSA assesses the suitability of the acquirer and will generally grant authorization if, among other things, the acquisition is found to be financially sound. The SFSA will also assess the acquirer's reputation, financial standing and possible links to money laundering and financing of terrorism. The ownership assessment also encompasses a suitability assessment of the management of all legal persons' acquiring a qualifying holding in Sirius International. The term management includes the board of directors, deputy board of directors, the managing director and deputy managing director of the acquirer. 
   United Kingdom Insurance Regulation 
 The financial services industry in the United Kingdom is currently dual-regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (the "FCA") and the Prudential Regulation Authority (the "PRA") (collectively, the "U.K. Regulators"). Prudential regulation and supervision of insurance undertakings is carried out by the PRA and the regulation and supervision of conduct matters is carried out by the FCA. All insurers and Lloyd's managing agents are regulated by both the PRA and the FCA, while businesses that only carry on insurance intermediary activities are solely regulated by the FCA for both prudential and conduct matters. The Financial Policy Committee (which is within the Bank of England) is responsible for the overall prudential regulation of the financial services industry. 
 There remains some considerable uncertainty as to the legal and regulatory landscape that will exist in respect of the U.K. insurance regulatory regime and the future approach U.K. legislation and regulation may take following the U.K.'s anticipated exit from the EU on March 29, 2019 and as to the terms of any transitional agreement that may be entered into between the U.K. and EU. 
 Sirius Group's U.K.-based authorized insurance subsidiaries are as follows:
  
 Sirius International Managing Agency Limited, a Lloyd's managing agent that is dual-regulated by the PRA and FCA and supervised by Lloyd's; and 

 33

    
 A La Carte Healthcare Limited and IMG Europe Limited, both insurance intermediaries regulated by the FCA. 

 Sirius International Insurance Corporation also operates in the U.K. under an EEA branch passporting license and one company within Sirius Group, Sirius International Corporate Member Limited, is a corporate member of Lloyd's. 
   PRA and FCA regulation 
 The primary statutory objectives of the PRA in relation to its supervision of insurers are (i) to promote their safety and soundness; and (ii) to contribute to the securing of an appropriate degree of protection for policyholders or those who may become policyholders. As conduct regulator, the FCA also acts to protect policyholders but the FCA's focus is to ensure that consumers are treated fairly when dealing with insurers and insurance intermediaries while the PRA's focus is to ensure that policyholders have appropriate protection in respect of the cover for the risks that they are insured against. 
 The U.K. Regulators have extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of the insurance businesses that they regulate and to monitor compliance with their objectives, including amending (including by imposing limitations on) or withdrawing a firm's authorization, prohibiting individuals from carrying on regulated activities, suspending firms or individuals from undertaking regulated activities and fining or requiring compensation from firms and individuals who breach their rules. 
 Businesses carrying out insurance activities in the U.K. must not only comply with the PRA's requirements (as set out in the PRA Rulebook) and the FCA's requirements (as set out in the FCA Handbook) but also a wide range of U.K. insurance legislation. The most notable of such legislation is the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ("FSMA"), which includes the requirements for becoming authorized to carry out regulated insurance activities, regulated and prohibited activities of an insurance company, the approval process for the acquisition or disposal of control of insurance companies, rules on financial promotions, transfers of insurance portfolios and market abuse provisions. This is complemented by a range of statutory instruments on certain subjects, for example the authorization or exemption process. In addition, U.K. companies carrying out insurance activities must comply with general legislation, such as the U.K. Companies Act 2006 and the data protection regime. 
   Lloyd's regulation 
 As well as regulating insurers and insurance intermediaries, the U.K. Regulators also regulate Lloyd's. The U.K. Regulators and Lloyd's have common objectives in ensuring that the Lloyd's market is appropriately regulated. Lloyd's is required to implement certain rules prescribed by the U.K. Regulators by the powers it has under the Lloyd's Act of 1982 ("Lloyd's Act") relating to the operation of the Lloyd's market. In addition, each year the U.K. Regulators require Lloyd's to satisfy an annual solvency test that measures whether Lloyd's has sufficient assets in the aggregate to meet all the outstanding liabilities of its members. The PRA and the FCA can give directions to Lloyd's in order to advance their statutory objectives. 
 The governing body of the Lloyd's market is the Council of Lloyd's (the "Council"). The Council is responsible for the supervision and management of the Lloyd's market and it has the power to regulate and direct the business of the market. The Lloyd's Acts, byelaws, requirements made under byelaws, minimum standards, guidance, codes of conduct and bulletins issued by or under the authority of the Council together contain the powers and requirements that apply in respect of businesses operating in the Lloyd's market. 
 Lloyd's does not itself carry on insurance underwriting but it regulates and supervises its members who do so. Lloyd's permits its corporate and individual members ("Members") to underwrite insurance risks through Lloyd's syndicates. Members of Lloyd's may participate in a syndicate for one or more underwriting years by providing capital to support the syndicate's underwriting, alone or together with other Members. Members are not required to be authorized by the PRA or the FCA under FSMA but they are supervised by Lloyd's and must comply with applicable Lloyd's rules. All syndicates are managed by Lloyd's-approved managing agents, who are also authorized by the PRA and dual-regulated by the PRA and the FCA. Managing agents receive fees and profit commissions in respect of the underwriting and administrative services they provide to the syndicates they manage. Lloyd's prescribes, in respect of its managing agents and Members, certain minimum standards relating to their management and control, financial resources and various other requirements. In addition, as dual-regulated firms, managing agents must comply with the relevant parts of the PRA Rulebook and the FCA Handbook (including FCA capital resources requirements).

   Lloyd's operates internationally through a number of trading licenses and local arrangements, and such activities are subject to local regulation and the specific requirements of those licenses or local arrangements. 
 Sirius Group participates in the Lloyd's market through the 100% ownership of Sirius International Corporate Member Limited, a Lloyd's Corporate Member, which is the sole member of Syndicate 1945. Syndicate 1945 commenced underwriting on July 1, 2011 and is managed by another wholly-owned subsidiary with Sirius Group, Sirius International Managing Agency. Lloyd's approved stamp capacity for Syndicate 1945 in 2019 is £81 million, or approximately $103 million (based on the December 31, 2018 GBP to USD exchange rate). Stamp capacity is a measure of the amount of net premium (gross premiums written less acquisition costs) that a syndicate is authorized by Lloyd's to write. 
 A corporate member of Lloyd's is bound by the rules of the Society of Lloyd's which are prescribed by the byelaws and requirements of the Council of Lloyd's under powers conferred by the Lloyd's Acts. These rules govern Sirius Group's corporate member and its participation in Syndicate 1945 and among other things prescribe its Lloyd's membership subscription fees and contributions to the Lloyd's Central Fund ("Central Fund"). If a Member is unable to pay its obligations to policyholders, such obligations may be payable by the Central Fund. If Lloyd's determines that the Central Fund needs to be increased, it may levy premiums on current Members. The Council of Lloyd's has discretion to call upon up to 3% of a Member's underwriting capacity in any one year as a Central Fund contribution. 
 The underwriting capacity of a Member must be supported by providing a deposit in the form of cash, securities, letters of credit or guarantees ("Funds at Lloyd's") in an amount to be determined pursuant to the Members' capital requirements set by Lloyd's. The amount of such deposit is calculated for each Member through the completion of a twice-yearly capital adequacy exercise. Pursuant to requirements of the U.K. Regulators applicable to the Members of Lloyd's as a whole, Lloyd's must demonstrate that each Member has sufficient assets to meet its underwriting liabilities plus a required solvency margin. The requirement to maintain such solvency margin can have the effect of reducing the amount of funds available to distribute as profits to the Member or result in the Member having to deposit additional Funds at Lloyd's to cover its solvency margin. 
 The amounts of capital required by Lloyd's to be maintained in the form of Funds at Lloyd's to support the activities of the Members of a syndicate is determined by a combination of the managing agent's assessment of capital requirements for the syndicate, and review and challenge by Lloyd's. The managing agent's assessment of capital requirements for the syndicate determines its view of the Solvency Capital Requirement ("SCR"); this represents the capital needed to support the syndicate, based on modeling individual syndicate robustness against the risk environment in which the syndicate operates. Lloyd's may or may not approve the level of SCR as submitted by the managing agent and has the authority to require the SCR to be increased. The approved or amended SCR is then uplifted by an economic capital margin (currently a flat 35% for all syndicates) to produce an amount of syndicate capital known as the economic capital assessment ("ECA"). The level of the ECA is set to ensure that Lloyd's overall aggregate capital is maintained at a level necessary to retain its desired rating, as well as to meet the requirements of the U.K. Regulators. Any failure to comply with these requirements may affect the amount of business which the syndicate may underwrite and/or could result in sanctions being imposed by Lloyd's and/or the U.K. Regulators. The process and the method by which the required capital is calculated may alter from year to year and may affect the level of participation of Members in a particular syndicate. 
 In addition to a Member's Funds at Lloyd's, at a syndicate level insurance premiums are held in a premium trust fund for the benefit of policyholders whose contracts are underwritten by the syndicate and these funds are the first resources used to pay claims made by policyholders of that syndicate. 
 Lloyd's has wide discretionary powers to regulate a Member's underwriting. For example, Lloyd's may change the way that syndicate expenses are allocated or vary the Funds at Lloyd's investment criteria. Any such change may affect the Member's return on investment. All syndicates at Lloyd's must also submit their business plans to Lloyd's for approval and amendments or restrictions may be applied to proposed business plans or, in extreme circumstances, approval may be refused which would lead to that syndicate ceasing to underwrite for the following year of account. 
   Change of Control 
 The change of control requirements in the U.K. are similar to the Swedish regulatory requirements. Prior regulatory consent is required before a person (alone or together with any associates) can acquire direct or indirect control over a U.K. authorized firm. 
 35



Prior approval is also required where a person (together with any associates) increases its holding of shares or voting power from (i) less than 20% to 20% or more, (ii) less than 30% to 30% or more, and (iii) less than 50% to 50% or more. The change of control requirements apply whether such change of control results from an external acquisition or an internal restructuring resulting in a new controller. 
 For U.K. authorized insurance intermediaries, the control threshold percentages are amended such that there is a single 20% threshold where prior regulatory consent is required. 
 In relation to the acquisition or increase of direct or indirect control over a Lloyd's managing agent or Lloyd's corporate member, such as Sirius International Managing Agency Limited and Sirius International Corporate Member Limited respectively, prior approval is also required from Lloyd's. 
   Ratings 
 Ratings by independent agencies are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies and are important to Sirius Group's ability to market and sell its products and services. Rating organizations continually review the financial positions of reinsurers and insurers, including Sirius Group. As of December 31, 2018, Sirius Group's insurance and reinsurance operating subsidiaries were rated as follows: 

 | | A.M. Best(1) | | Fitch(2) | | Standard & Poor's(3)
Rating | | "A" (Excellent) | | "A" (Strong) | | "A" (Strong) 
Outlook/ Watch | | Stable | | Stable | | Stable 
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 


 (1)"A" is the third highest of 16 financial strength ratings assigned by A.M. Best.  (2)"A" is the seventh highest of 19 financial strength ratings assigned by Fitch.  (3)"A" is the seventh highest of 21 financial strength ratings assigned by Standard & Poor's.

These ratings reflect A.M. Best's, Fitch's and Standard & Poor's respective opinions of the ability of Sirius Group to pay claims and are not evaluations directed to security holders. A.M. Best maintains a letter-scale rating system ranging from "A++" (Superior) to "F" (in liquidation). Fitch maintains a letter-scale rating system ranging from "AAA" (Exceptionally Strong) to "C" (Distressed). Standard & Poor's maintains a letter-scale rating system ranging from "AAA" (Extremely Strong) to "D" (Default). 
 These ratings are subject to periodic review by, and may be revised downward or revoked at the sole discretion of, A.M. Best, Fitch, and Standard & Poor's, respectively. 
 On June 21, 2018, Standard & Poor's affirmed Sirius Group's and its main subsidiaries' financial strength rating at "A" (Strong) with a stable outlook. 
 On June 27, 2018, Fitch removed Sirius Group and its main subsidiaries from negative watch and affirmed the financial strength rating at "A" (Strong) with a stable outlook. 
 On November 29, 2018, A.M. Best removed Sirius Group and its main subsidiaries from under review with negative implications and affirmed the financial strength rating at "A" (Excellent) with a stable outlook. 
   Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, Sirius Group had 1,055 employees. Sirius Group believes its relationships with employees are satisfactory.
