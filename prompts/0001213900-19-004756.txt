Item 1. Business.
General Overview
 
We are a fintech pioneer and a leading developer of cutting-edge secure cashless payment solutions providing global enterprises with innovative technology for almost three decades. We operate in two main segments: (1) Retail and Mass Transit Ticketing; and (2) Petroleum. In addition to our two reportable segments, certain products for the medical industry and other secure smart card solutions were classified under “Other” in segment analysis in previous reports. However, on December 3, 2018, we together with our wholly owned subsidiary, OTI Petrosmart (PTY) Limited, entered into an agreement with Smart Applications International Ltd., or SMART, to sell all of the assets related to our MediSmart division (for certain products for the medical industry) to SMART for $2.75 million in cash, or the MediSmart Transaction. The MediSmart Transaction closed on December 31, 2018 and therefore in this Annual Report we provide information only with respect to our two current segments, Retail and Mass Transit Ticketing; and Petroleum.
 
Our vision is to strengthen our global presence with innovative solutions and provide our customers with the best possible support in superior service and reliable advanced products.
 
Our IP portfolio includes registered patents and patent applications worldwide. Since our incorporation in 1990, we have built an international reputation for reliability and innovation, deploying many solutions for unattended retail, mass transit, banking, medical smart card, Internet of Payment Things, or IoPT, and the petroleum management industries. As described above, upon the closing of the MediSmart Transaction, we sold our intellectual property related to our medical smart card business.
 
We operate a global network of regional offices, distributors and partners to support various solutions deployed across the globe.
 
We focus on our core business of providing innovative cashless payment solutions based, among other things, on our innovative contactless NFC technology.
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel on February 15, 1990, under the name of De-Bug Innovations Ltd., with unlimited duration. Our name was changed to On Track Innovations Ltd. on July 8, 1991. We are registered with the Israeli Registrar of Companies, under registration number 52-004286-2 and our Ordinary Shares are traded in the Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq, under the symbol OTIV.
 
Our Markets
 
We provide cashless payment solutions for three major vertical markets:
 

1. | Retail and Mass Transit Ticketing
---+----------------------------------


a. | Self-Service (Unattended) Retail, Internet of Payment Things (IoPT) and Wearables
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Self-Service (Unattended) Retail - NFC and contactless technologies are embraced globally to create cashless retail environments known as self-service or unattended - a type of retail business where customers help themselves with respect to the products or services they wish to purchase, using different payment methods such as NFC, contactless, chip cards and magnetic strip (magstripe) to accept the payment. Examples of business models that permit their customers an aspect of self-service include vending, laundromats, kiosks, gaming, banking, mass transit, electric vehicle charging points and self-service (self-checkout).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As one of the pioneers of cashless payment technology, we have been working closely with companies in diverse industries and markets to design industry-tailored solutions that enable our customers to achieve their goals more efficiently.

Internet of Payment Things (IoPT) and Wearables – Wearable fintech technologies have become a modern trend. Today, it is common to find wearable technologies such as wristbands, watches or jewelry that are not only fashion garments but can also be linked to a smartphone and can measure a person’s heartbeat and footsteps. We believe that the next development of wearables will also allow cashless payment. Our expertise in minimizing the foot print of NFC payment devices allows us to offer manufacturers a way to easily turn their existing product into a pay enabled cashless device. We call this unique capability “PayEnable” and we intend to market products that include our technology with the “PayEnabled by OTI” mark. Our goal is that pay-enabling a product will be cost-effective and will require no expertise or special tooling from the merchant or the consumer. PayEnabled devices will support contactless payment similar to pre-paid, debit and credit cards. Additionally, PayEnabled products will also be able to support mass transit ticketing, e-coupons, loyalty programs and healthcare applications, and could also be used for proximity marketing (in-store promotions) and product authenticating (brand anti-counterfeiting). We manage our cashless payment solutions for the retail market worldwide from our headquarters in Israel.

b. | Mass Transit Ticketing
---+-----------------------


Mass Transit Ticketing – The constantly growing need for mass transit ticketing systems and services, together with the migration to contactless smart cards for mass transit payments, has led to the development of a ticket sales unattended and attended mass transit ticketing system by our wholly-owned Polish subsidiary ASEC S.A. (which does business under the name OTI Europa), or ASEC, initially for the market in Poland. The system is comprised of attended and unattended point-of-sales, or POS, including ticket vending machines and terminals, and is fully managed by a back-office solution. ASEC provides system design, installation, management and on-going system maintenance services on a full end-to-end turn-key service basis. Our solutions for the mass transit ticketing market in Europe are managed by ASEC.

Industry Background
 
Under certain regulations and credit card anti-fraud legislations, the use of contactless payment technologies has become an essential requirement for both consumers and retailers. Various market sectors have begun to massively adopt contactless payments and are constantly looking for ways to make the adoption process as convenient as possible for both merchants and customers. Millions of contactless debit and credit cards are issued annually by leading financial institutions to various consumers, and merchants are looking to install contactless payment readers that can be easily integrated into their existing unattended point of sale locations.
 
The world’s leading smartphone manufacturers are either including or are expected to include NFC support in their upcoming handset upgrades, which will enhance the technology adoption lifecycle. Whether it is a standard contactless travel card, or EMV contactless card, or an NFC mobile phone, the main motive is to provide quick and efficient payment solutions. Leading smartphone manufacturers have also introduced and are actively pushing the use of their own contactless payment solutions such as Apple Pay™, Android Pay™ and Samsung Pay™, all of which require a contactless reader to be available at the merchant countertop.

Strategy
 
Our goal is to maintain our status as a leading developer of NFC and cashless payment technologies and our reputation as a manufacturer of top-quality products carrying the highest certification standards.
 
Key elements of our strategy for achieving this goal include:
 

● | Expanding our global market presence. We market our products through a global network of subsidiaries in the United States, Europe, Africa and our headquarters in Israel. We are using these entities to strengthen our presence in existing markets, penetrate new markets, provide local customer service and technical support, and adapt our products to our local customers’ specific needs. We continue to expand our market presence via strategic distributors around the globe.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing our focus on generating high-margin, recurring revenues. We currently derive most of our revenues from one-time payments for our products and technologies. We intend to generate additional recurring revenues by receiving service fees for ongoing customer services and transaction fees from our customers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhancing our technological position. We intend to continue to invest in research and development in order to develop new technologies, extend the functionality of our products and services, and offer innovative products and services to our customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Customer Service and Technical Support
 
We provide our customers with training, installation support, ongoing customer service and technical support through our global network of subsidiaries, distributors and local services providers, including employees located in our corporate headquarters in Rosh Pina, Israel, as well as employees located in our subsidiaries in Europe, South Africa and the United States. Our customer service teams in Rosh Pina provide central services to our global network. Our subsidiaries, distributors and local providers, in turn, provide customer service and technical support by telephone and email.
Sales and Marketing
 
In addition to selling our products through our distributors, we sell and market our products directly and through our global network of subsidiaries. We have also engaged consultants to market and sell our products in the Asia-Pacific region. We market and sell our products in the Americas through our U.S.-based subsidiary, OTI America. In Africa, our subsidiary in South Africa, OTI PetroSmart, and in Europe, ASEC, our Polish subsidiary. In Israel and in regions where we do not have local subsidiaries or representatives, we market and sell through our main headquarters in Rosh Pina, Israel. Our marketing and sales staff implement marketing campaigns to promote our products and services to enhance our global brand recognition. Our current marketing efforts include participation in trade shows, conferences, press releases, four multilingual brand websites, social media, client/ distributor meetings and advertising in local and global industry publications. We also conduct technical seminars to inform sales staff, customers, distributors, business partners and other industry contributors of our unique products and innovative technologies.
 
Some customers also act as distributors for our products and have been granted exclusive distributors rights within a country or region. We generally guarantee exclusivity only against certain minimum volume commitments or other commercial conditions determined on a per case basis.
 

Customers
---------

 
Our customer base is concentrated among a limited number of large customers. Our revenues may continue to depend on a limited number of major customers. The customers we consider to be our major customers and the percentage of our revenue represented by each major customer vary from period to period. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, our customer related to mass transit in Poland provided 15%, 16% and 17%, respectively, of our total revenues for such periods. In addition, another customer in North America accounted for 9%, 12% and 9% of our total revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, another customer in Japan accounted for 11% and 11% of our total revenues for 2018 and 2017, respectively. If we were to lose any one of our major customers, or if any of our customers were to have difficulty meeting their financial obligations to us for any reason, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.
 
Manufacturing 
 
We outsource all our manufacturing and product assemblies to third-party vendors. Whenever possible, our policy is to use more than one supplier and manufacturing subcontractor for each part of our production process in order to limit dependence on any one manufacturer or supplier.
 
We are ISO 9001:2015 certified. We require that our suppliers and subcontractors be ISO 9001 certified. ISO 9001 is an international standard which specifies requirements for a quality management system and provides guidance and tools for companies to ensure that their products and services consistently meet customer and regulatory requirements. This standard is updated from time to time pursuant to the international authorization requirements.
 
11

 

Government Regulation 
 
Most of our products are subject to local electromagnetic compliance, or EMC/Radio regulations such as radiation, conducted emission and immunity, and safety regulations such as fire and electrical hazards, governed by low voltage standards for our regular readers and hazardous areas standards for our petroleum products, relevant in the countries in which they are used. In the United States, EMC/Radio testing and certification for such products are governed by Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, Part 15 while safety testing and certification fall under the standards set by Underwriters Laboratories, LLC, a public safety and testing certification organization, or UL. In the rest of the world, where FCC and UL rules do not apply, we follow various international and local standards for EMC/Radio and safety. The compliance with these standards is assured by testing and certifying our products at various accredited labs and/or notified bodies located both in Israel and other countries (e.g., United States, Germany, South Africa, India, China, Brazil and more). Our products are in compliance with the foregoing regulations.
Research and Development
 
We believe that our future success depends on, among other things, our ability to maintain our technological leadership, enhance our existing products and develop new products technologies and solutions. Accordingly, we intend to continue devoting substantial resources to research and development.
 
Our research and development activities focus mainly on two major areas:
 

● | developing new innovative technologies related to the cashless payment solutions market; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | enhancing the functionality of our components and expanding the range of our products to serve new markets.

 
Our main research and development facilities are located at our headquarters in Rosh Pina, Israel. We believe that our success is based on our experienced team of senior engineers and technicians who have extensive experience in their respective fields. Our research and development facilities are ISO 9001:2008 certified.
 
Proprietary Technologies and Intellectual Property
 
Our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology and IP. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret law, as well as know-how, confidentiality agreements and other contractual relationships with our employees, affiliates, agents, consultants, distributors and others.
 
Our IP portfolio includes issued patents with respect to our contactless technology, as well as trademarks and designs. While we have continued to seek new patents and to support pending applications, we have, as part of our efficiency program, reduced our investment in non-core patents and registrations. The expiration dates for our granted patents range between 2027 to 2033.
 
We cannot be certain that patents will be issued with respect to any of our pending or future patent applications. In addition, we do not know whether any issued patents will be enforceable against alleged infringers or will be upheld if their validity is challenged. We generally enter into non-disclosure agreements with our customers, partners, employees, consultants, suppliers, subcontractors, and generally control access to the distribution of our products, documentation and other proprietary information.
 
Competition
 
Our competition is with technology vendors that provide cashless payments solutions products and technologies:
 

● | In the Retail Market, our competition includes unattended payment solution and technology providers such as ID Tech, Nayax, Ingenico, Televend and Verifone.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the Petroleum Market, we compete with fueling and fleet management end-to-end solution vendors such as Orpak and Hectronic. As this domain has high entrance barriers, competition in this field is limited.

Employees 
 
Following is the number of our employees during each of the past three years:
 

Total Number of employees as of December 31,
--------------------------------------------
2018 | 2017 | | 2016
126 | | 120 | | 120

 
We operate in accordance with the applicable law and the provisions of the general extension orders applying to labor and employment relations in Israel. These provisions principally concern the length of the working day, minimum wages for employees, contributions to pension funds or managers’ insurance, contribution to work disability insurance, convalescence, travel expenses, holidays and other conditions of employment. We provide our employees with benefits and working conditions above the required minimum and which we believe are competitive with benefits and working conditions provided by similar companies in our industry in Israel. Our employees are not represented by a labor union. We have written employment agreements with substantially all of our employees. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, and it may be difficult to attract or maintain qualified personnel to our offices. We dedicate significant resources to employee retention and have never experienced work stoppages, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good. Our subsidiaries located outside Israel operate in accordance with the local applicable labor laws and have written employment agreements with substantially all their employees.
