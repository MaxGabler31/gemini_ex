ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Overview and recent developments
 
On January 29, 2018, Virtual Crypto Technologies, Inc., f/k/a Emerald Medical Applications Corp. (the “Registrant”) transferred the management shares of the Registrant’s former Israeli subsidiary, Emerald Medical Applications Ltd. (“Emerald IL”) owned by the Registrant to Attorney Eviatar Knoller, Esq., with offices at 20 Lincoln, Tel Aviv-Jaffa 6713412, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The purpose of the transfer of the management shares to the Trustee, pursuant to resolution of the Registrant’s Board of Directors dated January 29, 2018, was to enable the Trustee to liquidate the management shares and/or the assets of Emerald IL to satisfy its debts.
 
The operations of its former subsidiary never generated any revenues, at September 30, 2017 had an accumulated deficit of $16,462,502, and was unable to raise capital to fund its ongoing operations and satisfy its financial obligations to former employees. As a result, the former employees of Emerald IL commenced an action in a court of competent jurisdiction in Israel to liquidate Emerald IL and use any assets to satisfy the debts owed to the former employees. Effective March 8, 2018, Emerald IL ceased to be a wholly-owned subsidiary and a part of the Registrant.
 
The Registrant previously disclosed in its Form 10-Q for the period-ended September 30, 2017, under Note 9-Subsequent Events, that it was considering the advisability of establishing another wholly-owned Israeli subsidiary engaging in operations that should be more readily able to generate revenues and positive cash flow from operations than Emerald IL, which failed to generate any revenues.
 
On January 17, 2018, the Registrant formed Virtual Crypto Technologies Ltd as a new wholly-owned subsidiary under the laws of the State of Israel (“Virtual Crypto Israel”) and reported the appointment of Mr. Alon Dayan as CEO of the new subsidiary. Virtual Crypto Israel was formed to develop and market software and hardware products facilitating, allowing and supporting purchase and/or sale of cryptocurrencies through ATMs, tablets, PCs and/or mobile devices (the “Products”).
 
The Registrant filed a Form 8-K on January 24, 2018, reporting that through Virtual Crypto Israel, it entered into a binding term sheet (the “Chiron Term Sheet”) with Chiron Refineries Ltd. (“Chiron”), a public company listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE: CHR). Pursuant to the Chiron Term Sheet, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.__ hereto, the Registrant’s subsidiary, Virtual Crypto Israel, shall: (i) appoint a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chiron, under incorporation under the laws of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, as the exclusive distributor of Virtual Crypto Israel’s Products in the territory of the Republic of Turkey, including the territory of Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (the “Territory”); and (ii) the distributor shall have the right to appoint sub-distributors within the Territory. The appointment of the Chiron subsidiary as distributor is subject to the payment by the distributor of $250,000 as an appointment fee, of which $150,000 shall be deemed an advance payment by the distributor made on account of future purchases of our Products.
 
The Registrant filed a Definitive Information Statement on February 12, 2018 with respect to its name change from Emerald Medical Applications Corp. to Virtual Crypto Technologies, Inc. to reflect its new operations and business focus and effective on March 7, 2018, FINRA approved the Registrant’s name change and its trading symbol was changed from MRLA to VRCP on the OTCQB.
 
The disclosure in this annual report relates to our business activities during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Additional disclosure has been included in this annual report related to recent developments and subsequent events that occurred after the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
 
Specifically, during the period commencing January 16, 2018 through March 23, 2018, the Registrant raised $1.9 million in equity capital (the “Equity Raise”) through the offering of units (the “Unit Offering”) at a price of $0.07 per Unit, each Unit consisting of one share of the Registrant’s restricted common stock, par value $0.0001 (the “Shares”) and one common stock purchase warrant (the “Warrants”) exercisable for a period of 24 months to purchase one additional Share at an exercise price of $0.14. The proceeds of the Equity Raise are being utilized by the Registrant to fund the operations of Virtual Crypto Israel including, but not limited to the costs associated with the development of the Products. Reference is made to the disclosure under Item 5. “Market For Registrant’s Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters And Issuer Purchase Of Equity” and under Note 11-Subsequent Events, related to proceeds under the sub-captions “Issuance of convertible notes in 2018” and the “Equity raise from the sale of units in 2018.”
 
The Unit Offering, which is continuing, was made by the Registrant: (i) principally pursuant to the exemption provided by Regulation S promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”); and (ii) to a lesser extent pursuant to Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the Act; and (iii) and only to “accredited investors” as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC under the Act. With respect to the Unit Offering made pursuant to Regulation S, the Units were offered in offshore transactions to persons who are not “U.S. Persons” as that term is defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S promulgated by the SEC under the Act.

Our Former DermaCompare Business. Our former wholly-owned subsidiary, Emerald Medical Applications Ltd. (“Emerald IL”), was organized as a privately-owned company under the laws of the State of Israel on February 17, 2010, as a digital health startup company engaged in the development, sale and service of imaging solutions utilizing its proprietary DermaCompare software that it developed for use in derma imaging and analytics (“DermaCompare”). The Registrant believed that DermaCompare software represented an advancement in skin cancer screening that should have enabled physicians to more readily identify and monitor changes in their patients’ skin characteristics.
 
The Registrant believed that Emerald IL’s DermaCompare solution would allow dermatologists and other medical care professionals, using a set of 25 total body photography (“TBP”), to capture sets of skin lesion images with, among other devices, digital cameras and camera-equipped smart phones, which images could then be transmitted online and are remotely analyzed by professionals using our DermaCompare software.
 
Our sales and marketing plan was to sell services for Emerald IL’s DermaCompare imaging software to: NHSs, HMOs, health insurance companies, hospitals and medical clinics through distributers, health care channel partners or directly through independent salespersons and/or web purchase to dermatologists and other physicians (GPs) that we expected to purchase licenses based on the number of potential numbers of patients.
 
In furtherance of our business plan, Emerald IL entered into a series of agreements with unaffiliated third parties for the distribution of its DermaCompare Technology, as follows:
 
1. On August 12, 2013, Emerald IL entered into an exclusive distribution with Derma Italy Sri, organized under the laws of the Italy (“Derma Italy”), pursuant to which Derma Italy was granted exclusive distribution rights in Italy;
 
2. On December 1, 2013, Emerald IL entered into a distribution agreement with S. Bokhorst - Creatiekracht, organized under the laws of the Netherlands, pursuant to which S. Bokhorst was granted exclusive distribution in the Netherlands;
 
3. On February 6, 2014, Emerald IL entered into a distribution agreement with Medical Edge Pty Ltd, organized under the laws of Australia (“Medical Edge”), pursuant to which Medical Edge was granted exclusive distribution rights in the markets of Australia, New Zealand and Oceania; 
 
4. On January 14, 2015, Emerald IL entered into a Project Agreement with Realize S.A. and Ubitech, entities engaged in IT related to medical technology in Greece, and MEDISP and MPUoP, academic and research institutes in Greece (collectively, the “Greek Partners”). Emerald IL and the Greek Partners reported that they anticipated imminent grants from the Office of Chief Scientist of the State of Israel and the General Secretariat for Research and Technology of Greece, respectively, the proceeds of which were to be used for development of enhanced smartphone applications for diagnosis of early stage Melanoma. The development of the Mark1, bi literal plan was finished successfully and approved by the Office of the Chief Scientist of Israel in February 2017.


Notwithstanding our belief that DermaCompare represented a significant advance on existing technologies, there were a number of potential difficulties that we faced, including the following:
 

● | We may not be able to raise sufficient additional funds to fully implement our business plan; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Competitors may develop alternatives that render our DermaCompare software solution redundant or unnecessary; 
● | We may not obtain and maintain sufficient protection of our intellectual property; 
● | Our DermaCompare software may be shown to have characteristics that indicate it may be ineffective; 
● | Our DermaCompare may not be accepted by physicians including dermatologists and the medical community in general; and 
● | Strict government regulations and inappropriate reimbursement policies, especially in emerging economies, may hinder the growth of the dermatology device market. 

 
Notwithstanding the beliefs of the Registrant’s former management that Emerald IL would be able to successfully market its DermaCompare Products, the Registrant never generated any revenues from the operations of Emerald IL nor was it able to raise additional capital after its issuance of convertible notes to institution investors during the 2nd and 3rd fiscal quarters of 2016.
 
As a result, on September 1, 2017, the Registrant filed a Form 8-K reporting that it had entered into a settlement agreement with two of the institutional investors pursuant to which the Registrant agreed to the amendment and revision of the terms of the convertible notes (the “Notes”) and the warrants (the “Warrants”) originally dated June 20, 2016. The institutional investors had alleged that the Registrant was in default and in order to cure any alleged defaults, the Registrant agreed that the Notes, which had originally provided for a maturity date of June 19, 2017 and were in the original principal amounts of $400,000 and $40,000, respectively, were extended until June 19, 2019, in consideration for which the Registrant agreed to an increase in the principal amounts to of the Notes to $551,600 and $55,160, respectively, with an adjusted conversion price of $0.14. In addition, the Registrant agreed that the Warrants issued on June 20, 2016 be adjusted to provide for the exercise of a total of 11,331,252 shares at $0.14 compared to the exercise of 2,200,000 shares each at the adjusted conversion price of $0.14 in the original Warrants. The new Notes and Warrants were filed as exhibits to the Form 8-K filed on September 1, 2017.

During 2017, the Registrant filed several Forms 8-K with disclosure under Item 5.02 reporting terminations and/or resignations of members of its management and Board of Directors. After the year-ended December 31, 2017, the only member of Registrant’s Board of Directors that had been a director in 2017 was Mr. Yair Fudim, formerly an independent director since April 2015. On February 15, 2018, the Registrant filed a Form 8-K reporting the resignation of Mr. Ahmed Alimi as Chairman and CEO and the appointment of Mr. Fudim as Chairman and CEO. This change in the Registrant’s Board of Directors was in connection with the cessation of the operations of Emerald IL and the commencement of operations of Virtual Crypto Israel.
