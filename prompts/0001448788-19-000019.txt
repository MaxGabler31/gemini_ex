ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
We sell stevioside, a natural sweetener, and other pharmaceutical productions, such as Metformin. Substantially all of our operations are located in the People's Republic of China (the "PRC"). We have built an integrated company with the sourcing and production capabilities designed to meet the needs of our customers. Our operations are organized into two operating segments related to our product lines:
 

- | Stevioside; and 
--+---------------------
- | Corporate and other.

STEVIOSIDE SEGMENT
 
In our Stevioside segment, we produce and sell a variety of purified steviol glycosides with rebaudioside A and stevioside as the principal components, an all natural, low calorie sweetener, and OnlySweet, a stevioside based table top sweetener. For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, our Stevioside segment generated revenues of $18.2 million and $19.1 million, representing 87% and 100% of our total consolidated revenues, respectively.
 
The stevia glycosides are extracted from the leaves of the stevia rebaudiana plant of the Aster/Chrysanthemum family. The sweetness of the stevia leaves is caused by eight glycosides contained within the leaves including stevioside, rebaudioside A, C, D, E and F, steviolbioside and dulcoside A. Stevioside is the most abundant of these components and the main cause for the sweetness of the stevia leaves. Stevioside, rebaudiosides A and C as well as dulcoside A are known as the four most important steviol glycosides. Rebaudioside A is the sweetest and least bitter ingredient among the four. The higher purity of rebaudioside A brings better sensory attributes of the sweetener products.
 
The leaves of the stevia rebaudiana plant have been used for centuries to sweeten bitter beverages and to make tea in the plant's native Paraguay. Stevia is grown commercially in Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Central America, Israel, Thailand and China. The stevia rebaudiana plant was first introduced to China in 1977 and commercial harvesting of stevia started in the mid-1980's. There are two major species of stevia grown in China; one was cultivated by Chinese researchers and another was introduced from Japan. Most stevioside produced in China is exported throughout Asia, primarily to Japan and South Korea meanwhile Chinese domestic market demand is also gradually building up in recent years.
 
Worldwide use of Stevioside and Related Approvals
 
Stevioside is a safe and natural alternative to sugar for people needing low sugar or low calorie diets. Stevioside can be used to replace sugar in beverages and foods, including those that require baking or cooking where man-made chemical based sweetener replacements are not suitable. Stevioside may be used in a wide variety of consumer products including soft drinks, vegetable products, tabletop sweeteners, confectioneries, fruit products and processed seafood products in the United States, Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, Israel, Germany, France, Brazil, Paraguay, Malaysia, Russia, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand. 
 
We believe worldwide demand for alternative sweeteners, such as our stevia based products, will increase as more countries permit the use of stevioside as a food additive. Stevioside has been sanctioned by the Ministry of Health of China to be used as a food additive, and is listed in the Sanitation Standard of Food Additives.
 
The ongoing advocacy to eliminate the European Union's (EU) ban on the consumption of stevia was confirmed by the European Commission in November 2011. The European Stevia Research Center and the European Stevia Association are EU based organizations that focus on stevioside research and the elimination of the EU's ban on the consumption of stevioside.  These organizations have determined that stevia is safe for use in foods.  In addition, in June 2007, the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives concluded that steviol glycoside showed no adverse effects and was stable for use in food and acidic beverages under normal conditions and in June 2008 extended its recommendation for acceptable daily intake of up to 4 mg per kg body weight per day. 
 
In furtherance of our efforts to move toward production of organic, all natural and low calorie products and to enhance our international position and market penetration as a stevia producer along with our distribution partners around the world, we underwent an extensive audit in 2011 by CERES GmbH, an international organization that specializes in inspection and certification in the areas of organic farming and food processing. Upon completion of their audit in November 2011, CERES GmbH notified us that our stevia extracts production process had been certified organic and free of synthetic chemical inputs and uses clean and sanitized procedures that avoid chemical contamination under standards established by the USDA National Organic Program and European Commission (EC) 834/2007 and EC 889/2008.

In fiscal 2017, we have obtained certification of National Organic Program (NOP Certificate No: 50OP16SH0206 and NO: 50OP16SH0223) and certification of non-genetically modified organisms ("Non-GMO") with the ID number of 52462. NOP is the federal regulatory framework governing organic food. Certification is handled by state, non-profit and private agencies that have been approved by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). NOP regulations cover in detail all aspects of food production, processing, delivery and retail sale. Under the NOP, farmers and food processors, who wish to use the word "organic" in reference to their businesses and products, must be certified organic. A USDA Organic seal identifies products with at least 95% organic ingredients.
 
Steviosin
 
Steviosin is a natural low calorie stevia extract for medicinal use, containing stevioside at 90% with the total steviol glycosides meeting or exceeding 95% on a dry weight basis. Steviosin is used as an alternative sweetener in the pharmaceutical production in China.
 
OnlySweet
 
OnlySweet is an all natural, zero calorie, tabletop sweetener comprised of three natural ingredients, including stevioside. In June 2008 we began production of a new blend of OnlySweet increasing its sweetness. We believe this OnlySweet formulation represented a significant advancement in quality resulting in a sweeter and more natural taste compared to other manufacturers of stevioside based sweeteners. We believe consumers are attracted to these improvements in taste, absence of aftertaste and overall mouth feel of this new blend of OnlySweet. OnlySweet is manufactured in the United States at an FDA approved blending facility.
 
Our Customers
 
The majority of our stevioside is sold on a wholesale basis to domestic food and drug manufacturers and ingredient distributor of foreign trade companies. Our top 10 customers accounted for 53.8% of our sales in the Stevioside segment for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019. Our biggest customers Qufu Shengwang Import and Export Trade Co., Ltd., a related party, accounted for 21.2% and 31.4%, respectively, of our stevioside sales for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018. We do not have long term supply agreements with our customers and sales are generally made under a purchase order arrangement. The payment terms are generally 60 to 90 days after receipt of products. We control the default risk by conducting due diligence on the customers' credit record before acceptance of a purchase order.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials - Stevioside
 
The Shandong Province is a primary harvesting base of stevia leaves as well as the main region for the production of stevioside in China. We purchase all raw materials directly from local suppliers at market prices and pay for the leaves at the time of purchase. We test stevia leaves prior to purchase in an effort to maintain quality control. Our internal policy is to purchase leaves with stevioside content in excess of 9%.
Manufacturing, Extraction and Packaging
 
We have been engaged in the continuous production of stevioside since 1998. We use a traditional extraction technology process known as "aqueous extraction" which involves the use of purified water extraction and air dehydration to produce stevioside. The extraction process for stevioside generally takes seven days. The plant leaves are first dried and then inspected to insure quality leaves are used in the extraction process. We then use a combined process involving a solid/liquid extraction procedure, followed by a liquid-purifying step that is traditionally used to extract the stevioside from the stevia leaves. This all natural method results in a pure white stevia crystal, with no brownish coloring. Once the extraction process has been completed, the final product is ready for packaging and shipment to our customers. We bulk package our stevioside in 10 kilogram packages, two per box.
 
In July 2008, our stevioside manufacturing facility located in the Shuyuan Economic Zone of Qufu City, of the Shandong Province, received a Certificate of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) from the PRC.  
 
In early 2011, our stevia production facility operated by Qufu Shengren received ISO 22000 and ISO 9001:2008 integrated process and systems certifications, in addition to HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) certification from SGS S.A. and its country head offices in UK and China for this facility. SGS is one of the world's leading inspection, verification, testing and certification companies. In an effort to meet the international food safety standards mandated by larger consumer product companies that we expect to target as customers in the future, we have made capital investments to enhance our manufacturing facilities, equipment and documentation systems, changed certain manufacturing processes and carried out additional personnel training in order to meet these standards.  These investments allowed us to meet the HACCP System Certification, ISO 9001:2015 Certification and ISO 22000:2005 Food Safety Certification.  We obtained these certifications in October 2015.
  - 2 -
 

The ISO certifications cover all of the processes throughout the production cycle that deal directly or indirectly with the end product being consumed and quality management principles.  These certifications together with our comprehensive management system demonstrate the safety of our stevia products and our compliance with the requirements for food safety management systems by incorporating all the elements of GMP and HACCP.  HACCP Certification is an international principle defining the requirements for effective control of food safety.  HACCP compliance and certification demonstrates our focus on the hazards that affect food safety and hygiene and systematic identification of such by setting up control limits at critical points during the food production process.  By achieving these high level certifications, we have further demonstrated our commitment to quality, safety and continuous improvement.
 
In December 2012, Qufu Shengren finished the construction of a new stevia extraction line in the same location of its current stevioside manufacturing facility. This line facility applies a new stevia extraction technology to produce both high and low grade stevioside. The annual production capacity of this line facility is 500 metric tons including 300 metric tons of high purity Rebaudioside A products and 200 metric tons of low purity Rebaudioside A product.
 
Since January 2014, our facilities have the capability of producing A3-99 stevia products, which is the highest quality stevioside extracts produced in the world and are used in the pharmaceutical and food industries. We sold 6.1 metric tons of A3-99 each year and generated approximately $461,000 and $504,000 in revenue from producing A3-99 in the fiscal years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
Since fiscal 2014, our facilities have the capability of producing Enzyme treated stevia, which is one of the most advanced types of steviosides produced in the world for use in the food and beverage industries. We generated approximately $2,249,000 and $2,455,000 in revenue from producing over 62.3 metric tons and 45.9 metric tons of Enzyme treated stevia in the fiscal years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 
In the fiscal years ended April 30, 2018 and 2019, we have invested a total of $2.0 million for the two years, to purchase new manufacturing equipments for our facility with annual capacity of 500 metric tons in order to meet substantially increased demand for its high-grade stevia products. The new manufacturing facility is fully equipped with stainless steel equipment and a fully automated system in order to prevent any potential contamination from operators and plastic. In addition, the new manufacturing facility uses the most advanced production equipment that is the first time to be used for stevia production in the industry, such as a scraper with centrifuge and fluidized drying system.
 
As of now, Sunwin Stevia has approximately 1,200 metric tons of manufacturing capacity per year to produce high-grade stevia extract. With these manufacturing facilities, Sunwin Stevia is able to deliver stevia products containing Rebaudioside A in a range of 50% to 99% with a format of powder, granular, or tablet.
 
We set our production schedules based on the market demands and our capacity. Our total stevioside production capacity is approximately 1,200 metric tons annually, which we believe is sufficient to meet demand.  For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019, we manufactured approximately 1,075 metric tons of stevioside, an increase of 131 metric tons from the prior year, to better supply the market demand.
 
Competition
 
There are approximately 30 stevioside manufacturers operating on a continuing basis in China. While these competitors have production capacity similar to ours, we believe we are able to compete effectively with them based on our production capabilities and product quality. In addition, other companies periodically enter the market depending upon demand. These intermittent producers may choose to stop production when raw materials are not readily available in the marketplace. The sporadic oversupply of product from these competitors can adversely affect our market share. Furthermore, if demand wanes these competitors may reduce the price of their products, which can adversely affect market prices. In addition to competing with other Chinese companies, we also compete with foreign growers and processors.
 
We are one of the few steviosin manufacturers that are GMP certified and granted with a drug approval number. We believe that the combination of eligibility to supply pharmaceutical ingredients and capability for stevia extraction provides us with a competitive advantage compared to our competitors, most of whom are either not eligible to supply pharmaceutical ingredients or not experienced in large-scale stevia extraction.
 
NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
 
We engage in new product developments through our internal research facilities, industry consultants and specialists to provide research and development for the planting of stevia plants, the development of biological methods to improve lower-grade stevia product to higher grade stevia and applying biological method to change the taste of stevia to meet market demand.  We are in partnership with a number of research facilities in the PRC including:

- | We are working with a Jiangsu enzyme preparation company, to provide research and development for some of the enzyme modification products in order to produce better tasting products; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Shandong Chinese Medicine University. 

 
We pay for the use of these facilities on an as needed basis and the costs are included in our research and development expenses. For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, we spent approximately $982,000 and $842,000, respectively, on research and development. 
 
For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2019 and 2018, we have invested over $2.0 million in total for the two years to purchase new manufacturing equipment for our facility with annual capacity of 500 metric tons in order to meet substantially increased demand for its high-grade stevia products. The new manufacturing facility is fully equipped with stainless steel equipment without any plastic while it has a fully automated system in order to prevent any potential contamination from operators and plastic. In addition, the new manufacturing facility uses the most advanced production equipment that is the first time to be used for stevia production in the industry, such as scraper with centrifuge and fluidized drying system.
 
As of now, Sunwin Stevia has approximately 1,200 metric tons of manufacturing capacity per year to produce high-grade stevia extract. With these manufacturing facilities, Sunwin Stevia is able to deliver stevia products containing Rebaudioside A in a range of 50% to 99% with a format of powder, granular, or tablet.
 
 In fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 we invested in a new production line for Metformin as one of the new product markets we intend to branch into. Metformin is the raw material of Metformin hydrochloride tablets. Metformin is the first-line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, particularly in people who are not satisfied with simple diet control, especially those with obesity and hyperinsulinemia. This drug not only has hypoglycemic effect, but also may have the effect of reducing body weight and hyperinsulinemia. It can be effective in patients with poor efficacy of certain sulfonylureas, such as sulfonylureas, intestinal glycosidase inhibitors or thiazolidinedione hypoglycemic agents, which are more effective than single use. It can also be used in patients with insulin therapy to reduce insulin consumption. The sales value of Metformin has been growing since Metformin entered China in 1999.
 
In fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, we have invested approximately a total of $1.1 million in this new facility. The new manufacturing facility is fully equipped with stainless steel equipment without any plastic while it has a fully automated system in order to prevent any potential contamination from operators and plastic. In addition, the new manufacturing facility uses the most advanced production equipment that is the first being used for our production in the industry, such as the scraper with centrifuge and fluidized drying system. In fiscal 2019, we have been producing Metformin at a trial capacity to test the market and determine if this is a suitable product to be added to our operation.
 
While we were able to market and sale our Metformin products, with our current overhead and associated expenses, its profit margin has not been as lucrative as we had projected, our Metformin production line has been operating at a net loss in fiscal 2019. On July 10, 2019, we entered into a management agreement with Ru Yuan, an unaffiliated individual, to contract out the Metformin production line for 30 years using the Company's facility in Qufu. Under the terms of this agreement, Ms. Yuan will operate the Metformin production line independently from Sunwin assuming all of its profits and liabilities and will pay to Qufu Shengren an annual contract fee of RMB3,000,000 (Approximately $436,047).
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property which includes various raw materials purification technologies used in our products. We have received a trademark from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office covering the trade name "OnlySweet", which we are using for the North American distribution of our stevia based tabletop sweetener product.
 
To protect our proprietary rights outside the PRC we generally rely on confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and agreements with consultants, vendors and customers, although we have not signed such agreements in every case. We do not have any similar agreements with any of our employees or consultants in the PRC. Despite such protections, a third party could, without authorization, utilize our propriety technologies without our consent. In the past, three of our products have been copied by our competitors. We can give no assurance that our agreements with employees, consultants and others who participate in the production of our products will not be breached, or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our proprietary technologies will not otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
Our business and operations are primarily located in the PRC. We are subject to state and local environmental laws related to certification of water release. We are subject to registration and inspection by the State Food and Drug Administration of China ("SFDA") with respect to the manufacturing and distribution of steviosides. In addition, we are licensed by the Shandong Provincial Government to manufacture stevioside. We believe we are in compliance with all provisions of those registrations, inspections and licenses and have no reason to believe that they will not be renewed as required by the applicable rules of the Central Government and the Shandong Province. In addition, our operations must conform to general governmental regulations and rules for private (non-state owned) companies doing business in China. 
 
The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States is subject to various federal and state regulations, including but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"); the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products.
 
Compliance with applicable federal and state regulations is essential to our business. Although we believe that we are in compliance with applicable regulations, should the FDA or any state in which we operate amend its guidelines or impose more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations, we may not be able to comply with these new guidelines. Such regulations could require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, market withdrawal or discontinuation of certain products we are unable to reformulate, imposition of additional record keeping requirements, expanded documentation regarding the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling and/or additional scientific substantiation. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in sanctions being imposed on us or the manufacturers of any of our products, including but not limited to fines, injunctions, product recalls, seizures and criminal prosecution.
 
The FDCA generally regulates ingredients added to foods and requires that such ingredients making up a food product are themselves safe for their intended uses.  In this regard, when a company adds an ingredient to a food, the FDCA generally requires that the ingredient either be determined by the company to be generally regarded as safe by qualified experts or go through FDA's review and approval process as a food additive.
 
PRC Legal System
 
Despite efforts to develop its legal system over the past several decades, including but not limited to legislation dealing with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade, the PRC continues to lack a comprehensive system of laws. Further, the laws that do exist in the PRC are often vague, ambiguous and difficult to enforce, which could negatively affect our ability to do business in China and compete with other companies in our segments.
 
In September 2006, the Ministry of Commerce ("MOFCOM") promulgated the Regulations on Foreign Investors' Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises (M&A Regulations) in an effort to better regulate foreign investment in China. The M&A Regulations were adopted in part as a needed codification of certain joint venture formation and operating practices, and also in response to the government's increasing concern about protecting domestic companies in perceived key industries and those associated with national security, as well as the outflow of well-known trademarks, including traditional Chinese brands.
 
As a U.S. based company doing business in China, we seek to comply with all PRC laws, rules and regulations and pronouncements, and endeavor to obtain all necessary approvals from applicable PRC regulatory agencies such as the MOFCOM, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration for Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange ("SAFE").
 
Currency
 
 The value of the Renminbi ("RMB"), the main currency used in China, fluctuates and is affected by, among other things, changes in China's political and economic conditions. The conversion of RMB into foreign currencies such as the U.S. dollar have generally been based on rates set by the People's Bank of China, which are set daily based on the previous day's interbank foreign exchange market rates and current exchange rates on the world financial markets.

OUR CORPORATE HISTORY
 
We were incorporated in Nevada in August 1987 under the name Network USA, Inc. for the purposes of completing a merger or other business combination with an operating entity. Effective on April 30, 2004, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Sunwin Tech from its stockholders in exchange for approximately 17,000,000 shares of our common stock which resulted in a change of control of our company. Prior to our acquisition of Sunwin Tech, effective February 1, 2004, Sunwin Tech acquired 80% of Qufu Natural Green from Pharmaceutical Corporation, a company controlled by Mr. Laiwang Zhang, our President and Chairman.
 
In July 2004 following the transaction with Sunwin Tech, we changed the name of our company from Network USA, Inc. to Sunwin International Neutraceuticals, Inc.
 
In February 2006, we acquired the remaining 20% of Qufu Natural Green. On November 18, 2008, Qufu Natural Green completed its acquisition of 60% interest of Qufu Shengwang. In March 2009, Qufu Natural Green completed its acquisition of 100% interest of Qufu Shengren.
 
On February 5, 2009, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with WILD Flavors to purchase 20,000,000 shares of our common stock at $0.15 per share together with five year warrants to purchase 26,666,666 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $0.35 per share. Pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement, we converted our Sunwin Stevia International subsidiary into a limited liability company called Sunwin USA.
 
In July 2010 Qufu Natural Green sold its 100% ownership interest in Shengya Veterinary Medicine to Mr. Laiwang Zhang, our president and chairman of our board of directors. On September 30, 2011, Qufu Shengwang purchased the 40% equity interest in Qufu Shengwang owned by our Korean partners, Korea Stevia Company, Limited, for $626,125 in cash, and as a result of this repurchase transaction we now own 100% equity interest in all of the net assets of our subsidiary Qufu Shengwang.
 
In April 2012 we changed our corporate name to Sunwin Stevia International, Inc.
 
In August 2012, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with WILD Flavors pursuant to which it purchased its 45% membership interest in Sunwin USA for an aggregate consideration of approximately $1,625,874, which includes the issuance of 7,666,666 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $1,533,333 and a cash payment of $92,541, the purchase included the product development and supply chain for OnlySweet.
 
On April 30, 2018, the Company decided that it was in its best interest to discontinue and close Sunwin Tech since it ceased operations four year ago. All assets and liabilities owned by Sunwin Tech, including the equity ownership of Qufu Natural Green transferred to and is assumed by Sunwin Stevia International, Inc.
 
 On July 10, 2019, our wholly owned subsidiary Qufu Shengren entered into a management agreement with Ru Yuan, an unaffiliated individual (the "Contractor") to contract out the operation of the metformin production line for the term of 30 years.  In accordance with the agreement, the Contractor will be responsible for all expenses and overhead related to the operation of this production line, including employee payroll, benefits, utilities and etc., and pay an annual contract fee of RMB3,000,000 (approximately $436,047) to Qufu Shengren.
 
On July 30, 2019, Qufu Natural Green entered into an Asset Transfer Agreement with Na Li, an unaffiliated individual (the "Buyer") for the sale of 100% equity ownership of Qufu Shengwang. Pursuant to the Asset Transfer Agreement, the Buyer shall pay to Qufu Natural Green a total cash consideration of RMB8,000,000 (approximately $1,162,790) based on the estimated net book value as of July 30, 2019, payable in two installments of RMB5,000,000 (approximately $726,744) on July 30, 2019 and RMB3,000,000 (approximately $436,046) on September 30, 2019. The Buyer assumed all assets and liabilities of Qufu Shengwang including the amount of Qufu Shengwang's due to Qufu Natural Green of approximately RMB26,000,000 (approximately $3,779,070), and Qufu Natural Green shall assist in completing all documents required for the equity transfer after confirming receipt of the first payment. The Company received the first installment of RMB5,000,000 on July 30, 2019.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of August 10, 2019, we have 277 full time employees. The number of employees excludes employees of discontinued operations. All of our employees are primarily based in Qufu, China while some managerial and sales staff occasionally work in other Chinese cities or overseas on different projects. Each full-time Chinese employee is a member of a local trade union. Labor relations have remained positive and we have not had any employee strikes or major labor disputes. Unlike trade unions in western countries, trade unions in most parts of China are organizations mobilized jointly by the government and the management of the corporation.
