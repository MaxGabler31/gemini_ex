ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
Business Overview

DRH is a restaurant company operating a single concept, Buffalo Wild Wings® (“BWW”). As one of the largest franchisees of BWW, we provide a unique guest experience in a casual and inviting environment. We were incorporated in 2006 and are headquartered in the Detroit metropolitan area. As of December 30, 2018, we owned 64 restaurants in Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Missouri, including the nation’s largest BWW, based on square footage, in downtown Detroit, Michigan.

In 2008, DRH became publicly-owned by completing a self-underwritten initial public offering for $735,000 and 140,000 shares. We subsequently completed underwritten, follow-on offerings on April 23, 2013 of 6.9 million shares with net proceeds of $31.9 million and on July 24, 2018 of 5.3 million shares with net proceeds of $4.6 million.

DRH and its wholly-owned subsidiaries AMC Group, Inc. (“AMC”), AMC Wings, Inc. ("WINGS”), and AMC Real Estate, Inc. (“REAL ESTATE”and collectively, the "Company") own and operate BWW restaurants.
DRH is continually recognized as a leading franchisee in the BWW system. In 2018, our restaurants claimed 8 out of 15 Grand Prix awards, recognizing the top 15 operators in the franchise system. In 2017 and 2016, three and four of the Company's restaurants, respectively, were recognized as Blazin' 25 restaurants, which rewarded the top performing 25 franchise restaurants in the system. In both 2015 and 2014 we were recognized as Franchisee of the Year. Additionally, in 2016 our Chief Operating Officer was awarded the Franchise Advisory Council Excellence Award and in 2014 he received the Founders' Award.

The following organizational chart outlines the current corporate structure of DRH. A brief description of the entities follows the organizational chart. DRH is incorporated in Nevada.
AMC was formed on March 28, 2007, and serves as our operational and administrative center. AMC renders management, operational support, and advertising services to WINGS, REAL ESTATE and their subsidiaries. Services rendered by AMC include marketing, restaurant operations, restaurant management consultation, hiring and training of management and staff, and other management services required in the ordinary course of restaurant operations.

WINGS was formed on March 12, 2007, and serves as a holding company for our restaurants. We are economically dependent on retaining our franchise rights with BWW. The franchise agreements have specific initial term expiration dates ranging from December 2020 through June 2037. The franchise agreements are renewable at the option of the franchisor and are generally renewable if the franchisee has complied with the terms of the franchise agreement. When factoring in any applicable renewals, the franchise agreements have specific expiration dates ranging from December 2025 through June 2052. We believe we are in substantial compliance with the terms of these agreements.
REAL ESTATE was formed on March 18, 2013 and serves as the holding company for any real estate properties owned by DRH. Currently, DRH does not own any real estate.
Our headquarters are located at 27680 Franklin Road, Southfield, Michigan 48034. Our telephone number is (833) 374-7282. We can also be found on the Internet at www.diversifiedrestaurantholdings.com.
As of December 30, 2018, we had 2,549 employees of which 1,372 were full-time employees.

Background
Bagger Dave’s Spin-Off
On December 25, 2016, DRH completed a tax-free spin-off (the “Spin-Off”) of its Bagger Dave's business. Specifically, DRH contributed its 100.0% owned entity, AMC Burgers, LLC and certain real estate entities into Bagger Dave's Burger Tavern, Inc., a newly created Nevada corporation ("Bagger Dave's" or "Bagger"), which was then spun-off into a stand-alone, publicly-traded company on the over-the-counter exchange. In connection with the Spin-Off, DRH contributed to Bagger certain assets, liabilities, and employees related to its Bagger Dave's businesses. Intercompany balances due to/from DRH, which included amounts from sales, were contributed to equity. Additionally, DRH contributed $2 million in cash to Bagger to provide working capital for Bagger’s operations and remains a guarantor for certain of Bagger's lease obligations.
In conjunction with the Spin-Off, DRH entered into a transition services agreement (the "TSA") with Bagger Dave's pursuant to which DRH provided certain information technology and human resources support, limited accounting support, and other minor administrative functions at no charge. The TSA was intended to assist the discontinued component in efficiently and seamlessly transitioning to stand on its own. Certain provisions of the TSA terminated in December 2017 and the First Amendment to TSA (the "Amended TSA") was entered into effective January 1, 2018. Under the Amended TSA, DRH provides limited ongoing administrative support to Bagger in certain areas, including information technology, human resources and real estate, in exchange for a fee based on a rate-per-hour of service.
Restaurant Concept

With 64 BWW restaurants (20 in Michigan, 17 in Florida, 15 in Missouri, seven in Illinois and five in Indiana), including the nation’s largest BWW, based on square footage, in downtown Detroit, Michigan, DRH is one of the largest BWW franchisees. As of December 30, 2018, BWW reported over 1,270 restaurants worldwide that were either directly owned or franchised. The restaurants feature a variety of boldly-flavored, crave-able menu items, including Buffalo, New York-style chicken wings. BWW restaurants create a welcoming neighborhood atmosphere that includes an extensive multi-media system, a full bar and an open layout, which appeals to sports fans and families alike. The social environment created and the connections made with team members, guests and the local community help to differentiate BWW restaurants. Guests have the option of watching sporting events or other popular programs on various projector screens and televisions, competing in Buzztime ® Trivia or playing video games. The open layout of the restaurants offers dining and bar areas that provide distinct seating choices for sports fans and families. BWW restaurants offer flexibility and allow guests to customize their experience to meet their time demands, service preferences or the experience they are seeking for a workday lunch, a dine-in dinner, a take-out meal, an afternoon or evening enjoying a sporting event, or a late-night craving. 
BWW restaurants have widespread appeal and have won dozens of “Best Wings” and “Best Sports Bar” awards across the country. The made-to-order menu items are enhanced by the bold flavor profile of 16 signature sauces and 5 signature seasonings, ranging from Sweet BBQ™ to Blazin’®. Restaurants offer 20 to 40 domestic and imported beers on tap, including craft brews, and a wide selection of bottled beers, wines, and liquor. The award-winning food and memorable experience drive guest visits and loyalty. For fiscal year 2018, our average BWW restaurant derived 83% of its revenue from food, including non-alcoholic beverages, and 17% of its revenue from alcohol sales, primarily draft beer.
Growth Strategy
We are focused on driving sales growth in all of our locations through the execution of local, traffic-driving marketing and advertising strategies, continued support of the community through sponsorship programs and local charities, and delivery of quality food, drinks and service, all in a clean and modern environment. One of our guiding principles is that a happy team member translates to a happy guest. A happy guest drives repeat sales and word-of-mouth referrals, which are two key factors that directly support our local marketing strategy.
We also strive to improve our margins through a number of initiatives, including enhanced methods to manage cost of sales and hourly labor with use of technology and improved application of standards, and working with our service vendors to leverage our scale and obtain higher value at more competitive prices.
We currently own 64 BWW restaurants in five states. We may open a limited number of new BWW locations in our core markets over the long term. However, as capital resources become available, our growth strategy is more likely to consist of disciplined, strategic acquisitions of existing BWW or other franchised restaurants from other operators or franchisors.

Since 2012 we have acquired 29 restaurants in several transactions and have developed a strong process to identify, evaluate and integrate acquisitions. We have been regularly recognized as one of the best operators in the BWW system, and we believe that we can apply our strong operating disciplines and management culture to acquired locations to achieve financial improvements and growth over the long term. On February 22, 2019 we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire 9 BWW restaurants in the Chicago, Illinois market for a cash purchase price of approximately $22.5 million, subject to customary closing conditions. Upon completion of the transaction, since 2012, we will have acquired a total of 38 restaurants and will own and operate a total of 73 BWW restaurants. The transaction remains subject to the franchisor waiving its right of first refusal and franchisor consent, among other things. The transaction also remains contingent upon the Company's completion of satisfactory financing.
Restaurant Operations
We believe retaining talented and passionate restaurant managers and providing our team members with the tools, skills and motivation to deliver our goal of the ultimate social experience, represent two key elements to our success. In order to retain our unique culture, we devote substantial resources to identifying, selecting, and training our restaurant-level team members. We typically have six in-restaurant trainers at each location who provide both front- and back-of-house training on site. We also have a seven-week training program for our restaurant managers, which consists of an average of four weeks of restaurant training and three weeks of cultural training. During this training, managers observe and have the opportunity to participate in our established restaurants’ operations and guest interactions. We believe our focus on guest-centric training is a core strength of our Company and reinforces our mission to delight our guests.
Management and Staffing
The core values that define our culture are to be guest driven, team focused, community connected and dedicated to excellence. Our restaurants are generally staffed with one managing partner and up to five additional managers, depending on the sales volume of the restaurant. The managing partner is responsible for day-to-day operations and for maintaining the standards of quality and performance that define our corporate culture. We use regional directors to oversee our managing partners and supervise the operation of our restaurants, including the continuing development of each restaurant’s management team. Through regular visits to the restaurants and constant communication with the management team, the regional directors ensure adherence to all aspects of our concept, strategy and standards of quality.
Training, Development, and Recruiting
We believe that successful restaurant operations, guest satisfaction, quality, and cleanliness begin with the team member - a key component of our strategy. Our training program, the Hospitality Excellence Academy ("HEA"), is a well-organized, thorough, hands-on training program designed to foster our culture of excellence by cultivating the leaders of tomorrow. We are also in the process of implementing a new learning management system which is expected to represent another step forward by introducing a fully digital platform.
We offer an incentive program that we believe is very competitive in the restaurant industry. In addition to competitive base salaries and benefits, management is incentivized with a performance-based bonus program. Our benefit offerings include group health, dental, and vision insurance, a company-sponsored Safe Harbor 401(k) plan with a non-discretionary company match, a tuition reimbursement program, a referral bonus program and opportunities for career advancement. We emphasize growth from within the organization, giving our team members the opportunity to develop and advance. We believe this philosophy helps build a strong, loyal management team with high team member retention rates, giving us an advantage over our competitors.
Restaurants
Our restaurants range in size from 5,300 to 13,500 square feet, with an average of about 6,400 square feet. We anticipate that future restaurants will range in size from 4,800 to 5,500 square feet with an average cash investment per restaurant ranging from approximately $1.7 million to $2.6 million for a leased site. From time to time, our restaurants may be smaller or larger or cost more or less than our targeted range, depending on the particular circumstances of the selected site. Also, from time to time, we may elect to purchase either the building or the land and the building for certain restaurants, which would require additional capital.

We have a continuous capital improvement plan for our restaurants and generally plan major renovations every seven to ten years. For a more detailed discussion of our capital improvement plans, see the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and specifically, the subsection entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources; Acquisition and Expansion Plans.”

Quality Control and Purchasing
We strive to maintain high quality standards, protecting our food supply at all times. Purchasing for our restaurants is primarily through channels established by BWW corporate operations. We do, however, negotiate directly with many of these channels regarding price and delivery terms. When we purchase directly, we seek to obtain the highest quality ingredients, products, and supplies from reliable sources at competitive prices. To maximize our purchasing efficiencies, our corporate staff negotiates, when available, fixed-price contracts (usually for a one-year period) or, where appropriate, contracts based on commodity indexes.
Marketing and Advertising
We are required to pay an advertising fee to BWW equal to 3.00% - 3.15% of total net sales (the "National Ad Fund fee"), which supports national advertising designed to build brand awareness and drive traffic to our restaurants. Some examples include television commercials on major networks, particularly during certain regional and national key games for the NFL, NHL, MLB, NBA, NCAA football, NCAA basketball and the March Madness NCAA basketball tournament. In addition, we invest 0.25% - 0.5% of certain regional net sales in cooperatives of BWW restaurants for two metropolitan areas. We currently have co-ops for the Detroit, MI and Chicago, IL markets where we engage in coordinated local restaurant marketing efforts with other BWW restaurants.
In addition to the National Ad Fund fee, in fiscal year 2018, we spent approximately 1% of total net sales on local marketing efforts (including co-ops), before rebates. This includes charitable donations and local community sponsorships, which help develop local public relations and are a major component of our marketing efforts. We support programs that build traffic at the grass-roots level. We also participate in numerous local restaurant marketing events throughout the communities we serve.
Information Systems and Technology

Enhancing the security of our financial data and other personal information remains a high priority for us. We continue to innovate and modernize our technology infrastructure to provide improved efficiency, control and security. Our ability to accept credit cards as payment in our restaurants and for online orders depends on us remaining compliant with standards set by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (“PCI”). The PCI standards include compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. We maintain security measures that are designed to protect and prevent unauthorized access to such information. We continue to assess new payment standards and have implemented EMV chip enabled devices to ensure the most secure interface available for in-restaurant transactions. We have also implemented a CCV-code requirement for online purchases.
We also believe that technology can provide a competitive advantage and enable our strategy for growth through efficient restaurant operations, information analysis and ease and speed of guest service. We have a standard point-of-sale system in our restaurants that is integrated to our corporate office through a web-based, above-store business intelligence reporting and analysis tool. Our systems are designed to improve operating efficiencies, enable rapid analysis of marketing and financial information and improve administrative productivity. We also integrated the online ordering function and leverage third-party vendors which allow guests to select the music played throughout the restaurant using their mobile devices. In-restaurant tablets have also been introduced to enhance the guest experience through arcade games, some of which are free and some of which are available for purchase. In 2018 we implemented a new operations execution technology platform to enforce compliance and streamline performance across our restaurants. Additionally, in 2017 we completed the roll-out of the BWW loyalty program, Blazin' Rewards®, which is a mobile-based loyalty program.

We are constantly assessing new technologies to improve operations, back-office processes and overall guest experience. This includes the implementation of mobile payment options, advanced programming of kitchen display units, tablet-based wait-listing applications, integration with delivery service providers, and server tablet ordering functionality.
Competition

The restaurant industry is highly competitive. We believe we compete primarily with local and regional sports bars and national casual dining and quick-casual establishments. Competition is expected to remain intense with respect to price, service, location, concept and type and quality of food. There is also competition for real estate sites, qualified management personnel and hourly restaurant staff. Many of our competitors have been in existence longer than we have and may be better established in markets where we are currently located or may, in the future, be located. Accordingly, we strive to continually improve our restaurants, maintain high quality standards and treat our guests in a manner that encourages them to return. We believe our pricing communicates value to guests in a comfortable, welcoming, full service atmosphere.

Trademarks, Service Marks, and Trade Secrets
The BWW registered service mark is owned by Buffalo Wild Wings, International, Inc.
Government Regulations
The restaurant industry is subject to numerous federal, state, and local governmental regulations, including those relating to the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages, sanitation, public health, nutrition labeling requirements, fire codes, zoning, and building requirements and to periodic review by state and municipal authorities for areas in which the restaurants are located. Each restaurant requires appropriate licenses from regulatory authorities allowing it to sell beer, wine and liquor and each restaurant requires food service licenses from local health authorities. The majority of our licenses to sell alcoholic beverages must be renewed annually and may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause, including violation by us or our team members of any law or regulation pertaining to alcoholic beverage control, such as those regulating the minimum age of team members or patrons who may serve or be served alcoholic beverages, the serving of alcoholic beverages to visibly intoxicated patrons, advertising, wholesale purchasing and inventory control. In order to reduce this risk, restaurant team members are trained in standardized operating procedures designed to assure compliance with all applicable codes and regulations. We have not encountered any material problems relating to alcoholic beverage licenses or permits to date.
We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with team members. Our failure to comply with federal, state and local employment laws and regulations may subject us to losses and harm our brand. The laws and regulations govern such matters as: workers’ compensation insurance; wage and hour requirements; unemployment and other taxes; working and safety conditions; overtime; and citizenship and immigration status. Significant additional government-imposed regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act and similar laws related to minimum wages, overtime, rest breaks, paid leaves of absence, and mandated health benefits may also impact the performance of our operations. In addition, team member claims based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, wages, hour requirements and payments to team members who receive gratuities, may divert financial and management resources and adversely affect operations. The losses that may be incurred as a result of any violation of such governmental regulations by the Company are difficult to quantify. To our knowledge, we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and local laws affecting our business.
The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "ACA") applies to our business. Under the ACA, we are required to provide full-time employees with medical insurance that meets minimum value and affordability standards. We are also required to provide covered employees and the Internal Revenue Service with specific reportable benefit information. The Company’s medical plans have been offered to all full-time employees and meet the minimum value and affordability requirements of the ACA, and the Company has complied with the informational reporting requirements of the ACA.
Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. We may also be subject, in certain states, to “dram shop” statutes, which generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance which we believe is consistent with coverage carried by other companies in the restaurant industry of similar size and scope of operations. Even though we carry liquor liability insurance, a judgment against us under a “dram shop” statute in excess of our liability coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
