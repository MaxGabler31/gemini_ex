History and Organization
 
Overview
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on August 14, 2006 under the name IVPSA Corporation (“IVPSA”). On July 25, 2008, IVPSA Corporation entered into an Acquisition Agreement and Plan of Merger with EZJR, Inc. (“Old EZJR”). Immediately upon the effectiveness of the merger, Old EZJR ceased to exist and IVPSA changed its name to EZJR, Inc. (“EZJR). On January 12, 2017, we changed our name from EZJR, Inc. to Her Imports (“Her”).
 
We are a retailer of Human Hair Extensions and related haircare and beauty products headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. We sell our products at consultation studios and on our Website, www.herimports.com. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 16 retail locations, all of which were in the U.S.

We have one wholly-owned subsidiary, Her Marketing Concepts, Inc. (“Her Marketing”), a Nevada Corporation. All our employees are employed by Her Marketing, using a Professional Employer Organization otherwise known as a PEO.
 
Corporate History 
 
On November 28, 2016, we entered into an Asset Share Purchase & Business Agreement with Cabello Real Ltd. (“Cabello”), a private United Arab Emeritus company, to acquire the exclusive U.S. rights to the Her Imports trademark. In exchange for these rights, and other digital assets, we issued to Cabello 10,000,000 shares of our unregistered non-voting, non-cumulative, callable preferred stock and 1,250,000 shares of our unregistered common stock. In addition to conveyance of the Her Imports trademark rights, we purchased certain other assets owned by Cabello, including customer lists and various digital content.
 
On January 31, 2017, the Company effected a 1-for-2 reverse stock split effective January 31, 2017. The par value was not adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split. On April 9, 2018, the Company effected a 1-for-6 reverse stock split effective April 9, 2018. All references to numbers of shares of our common stock and per-share information in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and in these notes to the consolidated financial statements have been adjusted retroactively to reflect these splits.
 
Business
 
We are a retailer of Human Hair Extensions and related haircare and beauty products headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. We sell our products at consultation studios and on our eCommerce Website, www.herimports.com. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 16 retail locations, all of which are in the U.S (one of which was closed on that date and another that closed subsequently). These locations are primarily in “executive offices suites” such as Regus PLC, where furniture, administrative staff and security are provided. We then stock the location with products and point-of-sale equipment. These locations are leased on a short-term basis (primarily one year or less). This allows us to open and close our consultation studios with a minimal amount of time and expense. At the consultation studio, the customer is provided with a personal, one-on-one consultation with a Her beauty expert. Additionally, we have one larger location in Greenbelt Maryland where there are several consultants as well as a waiting room. We stock each of our leased locations with products and point-of-sale equipment. Six leases, including our corporate office, had leases longer than one year at the time they were entered.
 
Our goal is to expand our retail locations into additional markets to the extent funding and operation logistics make such expansion feasible. Additionally, we plan to expand the product offerings in our studios and on our website. However, since the beginning of 2018 we have eliminated [9] retain location to conserve capital.
 
eCommerce Platform
 
On May 28, 2014, we entered an Asset Purchase Agreement with Leader Act Ltd HK, (“Leader”) a private Hong Kong corporation to purchase an ecommerce Platform (“Platform”) software program developed and owned by Leader. The Platform entails all aspects of interaction that a company has with its customer, whether it is sales or service-related, provides a greater understanding of the customer and helps manage customer data and all interaction with the customer. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Leader agreed to service and maintain the software for a period of two years. For the Platform and service and maintenance, we issued Leader 5,000,000 restricted shares of common stock valued at $0.10 per share. This agreement expired in May 2016. On October 13, 2016, we entered into a five-year maintenance agreement on the Platform with Leader in exchange for 500,000 shares of our common stock valued at $375,000.
 
In January 2018, the Company converted to a new cloud-based eCommerce platform from its server-based eCommerce platform. The primary reason for the change was to allow the Company to optimize its mobile marketing efforts. In the past, marketing efforts have focused on traditional media, email, and search. However, due to the proliferation of smart phones and social media it is much more effective, while less expensive, to reach our customers using mobile marketing using SMS messaging and social platforms such as Facebook and Snapchat. Furthermore, advances in eCommerce shopping carts to cloud-based platforms allow for significant customization that was not previously available. The Company can interface with the shopping cart using various self-developed “mini-CRMs” depending on the marketing promotion and platform.

As a result of the change, the Company incurred a one-time charge of $383,542 from the write-off of the previous CRM and the prepaid maintenance agreement associated with it.
 
Media Investor Purchaser Agreement
 
On June 29, 2014, the Company entered into a Media Investor Purchaser Agreement (“MIP”) with Leader, a shareholder. On July 31, 2017, the MIP was assigned by Leader to Cabello, a principal shareholder. Prior to signing the MIP Leader advanced the Company $50,000 which the MIP allowed to be converted to 83,333 shares of common stock at $.60 per share. That left up to 9,500,000 shares of common stock that Cabello could purchase at $0.05 per share from its portion of the funds generated by the offers it creates. Contrary to customary practice, the MIP did not provide for any adjustment in the event of a future reverse split, so the Company’s 2017 reverse split did not affect the number of shares purchasable or the exercise price. This highlighted an unfair agreement which adversely affected the Company. This problem was exacerbated since Cabello is a related party. From April 19 to April 20, 2018, Cabello ran a program to sell a variety of the Company’s hair products. This program generated approximately $150,000 in revenue, however, a final accounting of the results of the program was never completed. Instead, on June 20, 2018 the Company issued to Cabello 4,500,000 shares of restricted common stock in exchange for cancelation of the MIP and forgiveness of any monies owed to Cabello for program in April. This cancellation resulted in a non-cash expense of $3,397,500 based on the estimated value of the stock issued in exchange for the cancellation of the MIP.
 
Agreement with Cabello Real FZE
 
On April 20, 2017, the Company entered into a Marketing and Selling Agreement with Cabello Real FZE, owner of a hair care product line called OSIworks, whereby the Company exclusively purchases, markets and sells OSIworks’ products in the United States. Under the agreement the Company pays Cabello a royalty of 2% of net sales. Cabello Real FZE is also controlled by Jonathan Terry, the Company’s principal shareholder. During the years ending December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 the Company recognized royalty expense of $13,329 and $14,675, respectively, related to the agreement.
 
Growth Strategy
 
Our growth strategy consists of the following key elements:
 

● | Expand our geographic reach. Having consolidated our operations during 2018 we plan to add new retail locations the United States and abroad as market demand dictates. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Broaden our addressable market. Currently our market consists primary of African American women. We believe that we can expand our business by addressing the needs of other ethnic groups in the U.S. 
● | Expand our product offering. We plan to add new styles of hair extensions and wigs as the market demands. Additionally, we plan to offer a broader range of haircare, beauty products and products specially addressing the hair extension and wig markets. 

Products
 
Currently, the products we sell fall into three general categories as follows:
 

● | Human hair extensions and related human hair products. Our hair extensions come in a variety of styles for a variety of uses. We currently focus on products that are woven into existing hair on the human scalp. However, recently, we have begun sourcing and selling products often referred to as “clip-ins” that can temporarily be installed and then removed for later reuse. Finally, we are now exploring selling full, high quality wigs. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Hair care products. We currently sell eight different hair care products, all under the brand OSIworks. The products include various shampoos and conditioners, specifically designed and formulated for use with human hair extensions. Additionally, we also sell an adhesive to be used in extension installation called Cling. Cling is not water soluble and, as a result, allow the wearer of hair extension to participate in activities such as swimming, water sports and jogging without fear that the installation of the extensions may be affected. 
● | Beauty products and related accessories. We sell a variety of beauty related accessories including silk bonnets, styling tools, and makeup. Styling tools include flatirons and curling irons and are sold under the brand Her Imports. Makeup is sold under the brand Skin & Yang.

Customers
 
Our customers tend to be African-American women who wish to have longer hair. We sell other product offerings to other ethnic groups to expand our customer base.
Customer Acquisition
 
We obtain customers through two primary channels, online marketing and traditional media. In the future it is our intension to focus on online marketing including mobile marketing and social media.
Online Marketing. 
 
To acquire customers, we are currently using a variety of low-cost marketing tactics including:
 

● | Social Media including Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Using email and text messaging to our existing customer base and potential customers who have registered on our website. 

Traditional Media
 
In addition to the above, during 2016, we acquired a significant number of social media “followers” by using radio advertising. While this method of obtaining customers was significantly more expensive than our current approach, we did build our database of potential customers that we are now leveraging through social media. However, it appears that local radio appears to be the most cost effective in smaller markets. During 2018 we again attempted to use traditional media including radio and billboard to promote our products. However, the results of these campaigns did not yield sufficient results to continue these campaigns. In the future, we plan to further explore additional other traditional forms of attracting new customers, including, but not limited to, celebrity endorsements, public relations and events.
Competitors
 
Hair Extensions. There are many competitors that sell hair extensions including individuals, salons, mall kiosks and online stores.
 
Some of our competitors include:
 
AliExpress
 Queen Virgin Remy
 Go Naked Hair
 Bella Dream Hair
 Extensions Plus
 Bellami Hair
 Indique Hair
 
Certain of these competitors have physical locations while the majority only sell online. Some competitors only sell low-quality synthetic hair. We believe that we sell the highest quality product at a competitive price, primarily because we only sell 100% human hair.

Our competitive disadvantages are:
 

● | Many of our competitors sell inferior products at lower prices. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Customers have a difficult time differentiating between vendors of human hair extensions. 
● | We do not currently address all geographical areas in the U.S. with our consultation studios. 

 
We intend to compete against our competitors through the following methods:
 

● | Offering superior products to our customers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Educating our customers regarding quality issues for human hair extensions. 
● | Providing accessory products to our customers. 
● | Expanding our geographical reach by opening new retail locations. 
● | Providing a superior online shopping experience to our customers 

Seasonality
 
The business areas in which we operate are subject to seasonal fluctuations due to the ability of our customers to pay for products, which ability correspond to product demand. Our revenues have historically been better during tax season which falls at the end of the first quarter through the beginning of the second quarter, while our revenues have experienced declines in the latter part of summer. As such, past quarterly results are not indicative of future results and may be subject to seasonal fluctuations.
Patents, Trademarks, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements
 
On November 28, 2016, we purchased the Her Imports trademark for exclusive use in the United States. With the exception of the Her Imports trademark, we have no trademarks, patents, licenses, franchises, concessions, or royalty agreements. We rely on a combination of trade secret and confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We will rely on copyright laws to protect our future computer programs and our proprietary databases.
Government Regulations 
 
We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. Numerous laws and regulatory schemes have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States. Our business is subject to the CAN-SPAM Act as defined below and similar laws adopted by a number of states, which regulate unsolicited commercial emails, create criminal penalties for emails containing fraudulent headers and control other abusive online marketing practices.
 
Similarly, the Federal Trade Commission, has guidelines that impose responsibilities on us with respect to communications with consumers and impose fines and liability for failure to comply with rules with respect to advertising or marketing practices they may deem misleading or deceptive or involve unfair trade practices. Many states have “little FTC Acts” which provide for triple damages and attorney’s fees resulting from unfair trade practices.
 
Need for any Government Approval of Products or Services
 
Our services do not require government approval.
 
Costs and Effects of Environmental Laws
 
We are not subject to any costs or effects of environmental laws.
 
Research and Development 
 
Since our inception, we have spent no funds on research and development.
