ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

Loop is a technology company whose mission is to accelerate the world’s shift towards sustainable PET plastic and polyester fiber and away from our dependence on fossil fuels. Loop owns patented and proprietary technology that depolymerizes no and low-value waste PET plastic and polyester fiber, including plastic bottles and packaging, carpets and textiles of any color, transparency or condition and even ocean plastics that have been degraded by the sun and salt, to its base building blocks (monomers). The monomers are filtered, purified and polymerized to create virgin-quality Loop™ branded PET resin and polyester fiber suitable for use in food-grade packaging, thus enabling our customers to meet their sustainability objectives. Loop Industries is contributing to the global movement towards a circular economy by preventing plastic waste and recovering waste plastic for a more sustainable future for all. 

The Company is in the planning stages of pursuing the construction of Infinite Loop™ commercial scale facilities in Québec, Canada, and with strategic partners in Europe and South Korea. Additionally, the Company has a joint venture to pursue the retrofitting of existing fossil fuel PET polymerization facilities with its recycling technology.

Industry Background and Market Opportunity

The global annual market demand for PET plastic and polyester fiber is expected to exceed $160 billion by 2022 as projected in the 2018 IHS Polymer Market Report. We believe plastic pollution and climate change continue to be the most persistently covered environmental issues by media and local and global environmental non-governmental organizations. Some of the main concerns associated with PET are the greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions associated with its production from non-renewable hydrocarbons and the length of time it persists in landfills and the natural environment. There is an increasing demand for action to address the global plastic crisis, as evidenced by the March 2022 endorsement by 175 nations of a historic resolution at the UN Environmental Assembly to end plastic pollution and forge an international legally binding agreement by the end of 2024. In the last few years, governments in North America, Europe and Asia have been enacting and proposing laws and regulations mandating the use of minimum recycled content in packaging underlying the strength of this issue in the marketplace. Consumer brands are seeking a solution to their plastic challenge, and they are taking action. In recent years we have seen major brands make significant commitments to close the loop on their plastic packaging by transitioning their packaging to recyclable materials and by incorporating more recycled content into their packaging.

Global consumer packaged goods companies (“CPG companies”), apparel manufacturers, and retail brands have announced significant public commitments and targets to make the transition to a circular plastic economy, namely:


· | In January 2018, Danone’s evian® brand bottled spring water committed to a 100% recycled content package by 2025; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | In 2018, Coca-Cola committed to an average recycled content of 50% across its packaging by 2030; 
· | In September 2021, PepsiCo stated 11 European markets are moving key Pepsi-branded products to 100% rPET bottles by 2022, and in the U.S., all Pepsi-branded products will be converted to 100% rPET bottles by 2030.; 
· | In 2020, L’OCCITANE en Provence committed to 100% recycled content plastic in their bottles by 2025; 
· | In 2020, L’Oréal Group committed to using 100% recycled or biobased plastic in their packaging by 2030; 
· | By 2025, Unilever targets increasing the use of post-consumer recycled plastic material in their packaging to at least 25%; 
· | Colgate-Palmolive states a 2025 goal of using at least 25% post-consumer recycled plastic in packaging; 
· | Nestlé aims to increase the amount of recycled PET used across their brands globally to 50% by 2025; 
· | Adidas Group aims to replace all virgin polyester with recycled polyester in all adidas and Reebok products where a solution exists by 2024; 
· | H&M is aiming to ensure that at least 25% of the plastic they use is from post-consumer recycled materials; 
· | Walmart has an objective to use at least 17% post-consumer recycled content globally in their private brand plastic packaging and is taking action to eliminate problematic or unnecessary plastic packaging and move from single-use towards reuse models where relevant by 2025;
· | Ikea’s ambition is, that by 2030, all plastic used in their products will be based on renewable or recycled material; 
· | Puma is aiming to increase the amount of recycled materials in their apparel and accessories products and by 2025, for 75% of the polyester used in Puma products will be from recycled sources; 
· | By 2025, Lululemon aims to achieve at least 75% sustainable materials for their products, including fibres that are recycled, renewable, regenerative, sourced responsibly and are manufactured using low-resource processes; and 
· | Nike has set a 2025 target of diverting 100% of its waste from landfills with at least 80% recycled back into their products and goods. 


There is a growing regulatory and policy environment to encourage a reduction in the production of virgin fossil fuel-based plastic and for minimum recycled content in packaging imposed by various governments:


· | In North America: Canada has announced a zero-plastic waste by 2030 goal and is targeting for all plastic packaging to contain 50% recycled content by 2030. A California law enacted on September 24, 2020 requires that plastic bottles contain at least 15% post-consumer resin by 2022, 25% by 2025 and 50% by 2030. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | In Europe: As of January 2021, the European Union introduced a new tax of €800/ton on non-recycled plastic packaging based on the amount of plastic packaging placed on each member state’s market. Effective April 2022, a new £200/ton tax will apply in the UK to plastic packaging produced or imported into the UK that does not contain at least 30% recycled plastic. Italy is introducing a tax of €450 per ton on virgin plastic used in manufacture or importation of single use plastic which is expected in January 2023. Spain has also proposed a tax of €450 per ton on non-reusable plastic packaging with an anticipated start date of January 2023. France has a stated goals of 100% plastics recycled by 2025 and 77% of beverage bottles to be collected.
· | In Asia: South Korea targets reducing plastic waste by 20% and increase recycling rates from 54% to 70% by 2025 and 30% renewable plastic by 2030.

The growing regulatory environment combined with global consumer goods companies, apparel manufacturers, and retail brand commitments for 2025 and 2030 are expected to increase the demand for recycled PET (“rPET”) plastic further.

Mechanical recycled PET plastic is produced principally through the conversion of bales of PET bottles. The materials have been collected and transported to a materials recovery facility (“MRF”), where they are sorted from other materials, baled, and sent to specific PET recycling facilities. The bales are broken and sorted to remove any non-PET materials. The PET is then ground and put through a separation process which separates the PET from the bottle cap and label materials. Clean PET flake is then further processed depending on its intended end market. It may become more highly refined PET pellet for new bottles or extruded into PET sheet for clamshells, trays, and cups. Recycled PET is also spun into fiber for carpet, clothing, fiber fill, or other materials.

We believe mechanically recycled PET has a number of challenges in meeting the quality specifications and growing volume requirements implied by commitments from major brands, mainly due to the cost and variety of acceptable PET feedstock. Some mechanical recycling processes involve remelting the PET flake which reduces the quality of the rPET output each time it is recycled relative to the specifications of virgin PET produced from fossil fuels. Each time the PET plastic is mechanically recycled, its quality and clarity are reduced. Therefore, mechanically recycled PET may need to be mixed with virgin PET from fossil fuels to maintain quality. Lower quality mechanically recycled PET is often downcycled to alternate uses such as polyester fibers which may be dyed and used in carpets or clothing. Additionally, mechanically recycled PET manufactured for use in clear bottles or food containers requires predominantly clear and clean PET flakes separated from waste bales, and cannot accommodate darkly colored PET flakes, lower quality fiber feedstock, or materially contaminated feedstock, which may be cheaper.

We believe the commercialization plans of Loop™ PET resin and polyester fiber may provide the ideal solution for global brands because Loop™ PET resin and polyester fiber contains 100% recycled PET and polyester fiber content. The Loop™ PET resin and polyester fiber is virgin-quality suitable for use in food-grade packaging. That means consumer packaged goods companies will be able to choose to market packaging made from a 100% recycled Loop™ branded PET resin and polyester fiber. 

Proprietary Technology and Intellectual Property

We believe the power of our technology lies in its ability to use post-industrial and post-consumer waste PET plastic and polyester fiber feedstocks, which could end up in landfills, rivers, oceans and natural areas, to create Loop™ PET resin. We believe our technology can deliver high-purity profitable virgin-quality, 100% recycled PET resin suitable for use in food-grade packaging and polyester fiber.

Our Generation I technology (“GEN I”) is a hydrolysis-based depolymerization technology which yielded purified terephthalic acid (“PTA”) and monoethylene glycol (“MEG”), two common monomers of PET. As the Company evaluated the transition from the GEN I technology from pilot scale to commercial scale, several challenges involving PTA and MEG purification were identified. To overcome the GEN I technology challenges, we embarked on the development of a second generation of our technology. Our Generation II technology (“GEN II”) is a methanolysis-based depolymerization technology that uses temperatures below 90 °C to depolymerize waste PET and polyester fiber. The low temperature offers several key advantages which the Company believes will improve its ability to commercialize the GEN II technology, including;


· | Lower energy usage during depolymerization and therefore reduced processing cost and lower GHG emissions relative to higher temperature processes; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Avoidance of side reactions with non-PET waste, which are inherent in waste PET feedstock streams, during depolymerization which may occur during higher temperature and higher pressure depolymerization processes. This allows for a simplified distillation purification process resulting in fewer, and more effective, steps to isolate the desired high purity DMT and MEG monomers suitable to produce virgin-quality PET required to meet food contact regulations as well as the quality and clarity requirements of global consumer product companies;


6


· | Allowing the depolymerization of less costly and low-quality feedstocks, which cannot be effectively recycled today, such as carpet fiber, clothing and mixed plastics, and upcycling them into high-quality PET that can be used in food contact use; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The GEN II technology uses only trace amounts of water, eliminates the need for a halogenated solvent and uses a catalyst at low concentration. 


This shift, from producing the monomer PTA to the monomer DMT, was a pivotal moment for Loop. We believe that GEN II requires less energy and fewer resource inputs than conventional PET production processes. We also believe it is an environmentally sustainable method for producing virgin-quality food-grade PET plastic by decoupling PET manufacturing from the fossil fuel industry.

To independently validate that our GEN II technology can produce DMT and MEG monomers at mini-pilot and pilot scale, we commissioned Kemitek, a College Centre for Technology Transfer specialized in the fields of green chemistry and chemical process scale-up. Kemitek’s findings allowed them to confirm that our technology produces monomers that meet our purity specifications for the production of PET resin and polyester fiber. The complete Kemitek report was filed with the SEC by the Company on December 14, 2020.

To protect our technology, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and provisions as well as other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our patents, brand names, product designs and marks. We have two technology areas, referred to as GEN I technology and the GEN II technology, with patent claims relating to our technology for depolymerizing PET.


· | The GEN I technology portfolio has three issued U.S. patents, all expected to expire on or around July 2035. Internationally, we also have issued patents in China, the Eurasian Patent Organization, Europe, Japan, India, the Gulf Cooperation Council, and various other countries, and pending patent applications in Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and various other countries all expected to expire, if granted, on or around July 2036, not including any patent term extension.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The GEN II technology portfolio currently consists of four patent families: 


o | The first family has two issued U.S. patents and a pending U.S. application, all expected to expire on or around September 2037. Internationally, we also have an issued patent in Bangladesh, and pending applications in Canada, China, the Eurasian Patent Organization, Europe, the Gulf Cooperation Council, India, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and various other countries, all expected to expire on or around September 2038, if granted, and not including any patent term extension. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | An additional aspect of the GEN II technology is claimed in an issued U.S. patent and an allowed U.S. application, all expected to expire on or around June 2039. Internationally, we also have issued patents in Algeria and Bangladesh, and pending applications in Canada, China, the Eurasian Patent Organization, Europe, the Gulf Cooperation Council, India, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and various other countries, all expected to expire on or around June 2039, if granted, and not including any patent term extension.
o | Another aspect of the GEN II technology is the subject of a pending U.S. application. Internationally, we also have pending applications in Canada, Europe, India, Singapore, Papua New Guinea, Brazil, and South Africa. Any patents that would ultimately grant from this application would be expected to expire on or around March 2040, not including any patent term extension. 
o | Another aspect of the GEN II technology is the subject of an issued U.S. patent and a pending U.S. application, all expected to expire on or around March 2040. Internationally, we also have an allowed application in Bangladesh and pending applications in Canada, China, Korea, the Eurasian Patent Organization, Europe, the Gulf Cooperation Council, India, Japan, Mexico, and various other countries, all expected to expire on or around March 2040, if granted, and not including any patent term extension.

Loop owns registrations for its trademarks in Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. Loop also has pending applications in Cambodia, Canada, Indonesia, Taiwan, the U.S., and Vietnam.

Government Regulation and Approvals

As we seek to further develop and commercialize our technology, we will be subject to extensive and frequently developing federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations. Compliance with current and future regulations, including food packaging regulations, could increase our operational costs.

Our operations require various governmental permits and approvals. We are in the process of obtaining all necessary permits and approvals for the operation of our business; however, any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. Additionally, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience delays in obtaining such permits or approvals. Failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits and approvals or to have the necessary approvals in place may adversely affect our operations and may subject us to penalties. See “Risk Factors” below for additional information.

We believe that if we are successful in addressing food packaging regulations in various countries and economic regions, that the regulatory environment may provide Loop™ PET resin a competitive advantage relative to mechanically recycled alternative resins and virgin PET.

Loop’s PET resin was subjected to independent testing by an external and certified laboratory, which confirmed the PET complies with FDA Regulation 21 CFR § 177.1630 on August 26, 2021, as well as EU Commission Regulation No 10/2011 on July 27, 2021. These results attest that Loop’s PET is safe for use in food-contact applications, including but not limited to bottled water, carbonated drinks and food trays. Demonstration of compliance with food-contact requirements follows the No Objection Letter (“NOL”) from the FDA previously granted to Loop in March 2021. The NOL confirms Loop’s monomers can produce rPET of a purity suitable for food-contact use, provided it meets the applicable requirements of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The monomers used in the PET resin submitted for testing were produced at Loop’s small-scale production facility in Terrebonne, Québec (the “Terrebonne Facility”).

We have received from the European Chemicals Agency a confirmation of registration for our MEG on November 17, 2020, and for our DMT on December 7, 2020. The registration under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) Regulation (EC 1907/2006) confirms that our monomers are of a purity equal to what is currently recognized within Europe and entitles us to manufacture/import the monomers into Europe. It should be noted that MEG and DMT are on the positive list for plastic materials, which means that the two monomers can be used as food contact materials.

On August 31, 2021, Loop also received a NOL from Health Canada, which states that the PET produced by Loop’s recycling process is suitable for use in the manufacture of water bottles and articles for contact with all food types under all conditions of use.

Supply Agreements with Global Consumer Brands

Consumer brands are seeking a solution to their plastic challenge and they are taking bold action. In the past years, we have seen major brands make significant commitments to close the loop on their plastic use in two ways; by transitioning their packaging to recyclable materials, like PET, and by incorporating more recycled content into their packaging. We believe Loop™ PET resin provides the ideal solution for these brands because it is recyclable and is made from 100% recycled PET waste and polyester fiber, while being virgin-quality and suitable for use in food-grade packaging and polyester fiber.

Due to the commitments by large global consumer brands to incorporate more recycled content into their product packaging, the regulatory requirements for minimum recycled content in packaging imposed by governments, the virgin-quality of Loop™ branded PET resin and its marketability to extoll the sustainability credentials of consumer brands that incorporate it, we believe we will be able to sell Loop™ branded PET resin at a premium price relative to virgin and mechanically recycled PET resin.

We currently have agreements with some of the world’s leading brands to be supplied from our planned commercial facilities, including:


· | A new multi-year supply agreement with Danone SA (“Danone”), one of the world’s leading global food and beverage companies announced on May 16, 2022. Danone will purchase 100% sustainable and upcycled Loop™ branded PET to be supplied from our planned Infinite Loop™ manufacturing facility in Bécancour, Québec for use in brands across its portfolio including evian®, Danone’s iconic natural spring water;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Multi-year supply agreement with PepsiCo, one of the largest purchasers of recycled PET plastic, enabling PepsiCo to purchase production capacity and incorporate Loop™ PET resin into its product packaging; 
· | Multi-year supply agreement with L’OCCITANE en Provence to supply 100% recycled and sustainable Loop™ PET resin and incorporate Loop™ PET resin into its product packaging; and 
· | Multi-year supply agreement with L’Oréal Group, the global leader in the beauty industry, enabling L’Oréal Group to purchase production capacity and incorporate Loop™ PET resin into its product packaging. 


We are pursuing amended supply agreements with existing customers and new agreements with additional customers that are located in North America, Europe, and Asia to sell the production volumes of our planned Infinite Loop™ commercial facilities.

Turning PET Waste into Feedstock

We use waste PET plastic and polyester fiber as feedstock. Our technology can use PET plastic bottles and packaging of any color, transparency or condition, carpet, clothing and other polyester textiles that may contain colors, dyes or additives, and even PET plastics that have been recovered from the ocean and degraded by exposure to sun and salt. We believe that our ability to use many materials that mechanical recyclers cannot use is both an important advantage of Loop™ PET resin over mechanically recycled PET resin and is additive to the number of PET waste streams that may be recycled. This also means we are creating a new market for materials that have persistently been leaking out of the waste management system and into our shared rivers, oceans and natural areas.

Commercialization Strategy

Our objective is to achieve global expansion of Loop’s technology through a mix of fully owned manufacturing facilities, strategic partnerships, and licensing agreements. We believe that industrial companies, some of which today may not be in the business of manufacturing PET resin or polyester fiber, will view involvement in Infinite Loop™ projects as a significant growth opportunity, which may offer attractive economic returns either as Loop manufacturing partners or as licensees of the technology. We are currently pursuing projects for future commercial production facilities in three regions: North America, Europe and Asia. The global expansion plan for our technology will allow our customers, mostly comprised of CPG brand companies and apparel companies, to expand the use of Loop™ PET resin and polyester fiber into their packaging and clothing. As countries around the globe continue to increase sustainability targets and recycled content mandates, our customers are increasing the use of sustainably produced materials into their products.

The Infinite Loop™ manufacturing technology is the key pillar of our commercialization blueprint. We believe our technology is at the forefront of the global transition away from fossil fuels and petrochemicals and into the circular economy, where PET plastic and polyester fiber are produced by recycling waste plastic rather than depleting finite resources. The Infinite Loop™ manufacturing technology allows for waste PET plastic and polyester fiber to be broken down into its base building blocks, monomers DMT and MEG, using Loop’s patented technology. Once the monomers are purified, they are then repolymerized into PET plastic or polyester fiber using INVISTA know how, which Loop licenses, and Chemtex Global Corporation’s engineering.  The INVISTA polymerization process and the associated designs are historically proven in the commercial production of PET resin and polyester fiber.

We have completed our basic design package for the Infinite Loop™ full-scale manufacturing facilities with our engineering partners Worley, BBA and Chemtex, all leading global engineering and construction companies. The engineering philosophy we have adopted is “design one, build many.” This approach allows for the basic design package, to be used as the base engineering platform for all future geographical expansion. We believe this approach allows for a quick execution, speed to market and lends itself well to modular construction. The basic design package has a capacity of up to 70,000 M/T of PET resin output per year. Permitting, site and regulatory considerations may impact plant capacity. Our engineering partners may also play a role in the future design of larger capacity facilities.

Our market strategy is to assist global consumer goods brands in meeting their public sustainability commitments by offering packaging or polyester fibers that are made with Loop co-branded, 100% recycled, virgin-quality PET or polyester fibers. We believe that Loop™ recycled PET resin and polyester fiber could command premium pricing over virgin, petroleum-based PET resin and provide attractive economic returns. We are targeting multi-year take or pay offtake agreements for planned Infinite Loop™ production. Factors under consideration in determining project economics include the feasibility design engineering and cost estimate work, timing and permitting of a facility, customer offtake demand, commitment terms, and feedstock sources, quality, availability, PET bale index pricing, logistics, and ramp up, among others.

Strategic Partnership with SK geo centric

Loop and SK geo centric Co., Ltd. (formerly known as SK global chemical Co. Ltd.) (“SKGC”) intend to form a joint venture with exclusivity to build sustainable PET plastic and polyester fiber manufacturing facilities throughout Asia, which accounts for approximately 60% of the world’s population and an estimated 70% of global PET consumption making it the largest market in terms of plastic manufacturing, consumption and waste. Under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) for the proposed joint venture, which was entered into in July, 2021, SKGC will own 51 percent of the joint venture and Loop will own 49 percent. Loop will also receive a recurring annual royalty fee as a percentage of revenue from each facility for the use of its technology. As of the date of the filing on this Annual Report on Form 10-K, final joint venture agreements have not been entered into.

In addition, on June 22, 2022, Loop and SKGC concluded a definitive agreement for SKGC to become a strategic investor in Loop. Under this agreement, SKGC purchased 4,714,813 new treasury common shares of Loop at a price of $12 per share, for total consideration of $56.5 million. The equity investment transaction closed on July 29, 2021. SKGC was also granted warrants to acquire an additional 461,298 common shares at $11 per share with an expiration date of June 14, 2022, 4,714,813 common shares at a price of $15 per share with an expiration date of July 29, 2024, and a further 2,357,407 shares at $20 per share, conditional upon the timing of construction of the first Asian manufacturing facility. 

SKGC currently owns approximately 10% of Loop’s common shares. In conjunction with the equity investment, Mr. Jonghyuk Lee, Vice President of SKGC’s Green Business Division, was appointed to Loop’s Board of Directors. This appointment reflects SKGC’s strategic view of the importance of its investment in Loop, as part of its “Green for Better Life” global strategic vision.

As reported on July 8, 2021 SKGC signed a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with the city of Ulsan, South Korea to develop an industrial complex which is planned to include the first Infinite Loop™ manufacturing facility in Asia.

SKGC unveiled on August 31, 2021 its rebrand as SK geo centric, aligning with the company’s goal of transforming into a green company and focusing on eco-friendly products such as recyclable plastics. These announcements further reinforce Loop’s alignment as an important strategic partner for SK geo centric, as we move to commercialize our technology in Asia.

Unveiling of New evian Loop Bottle

On September 20, 2021, Loop, in partnership with iconic global beverage brand evian, unveiled a new “evian Loop” prototype virgin-quality water bottle made from 100% recycled content. The monomers used to produce the evian Loop bottles were made at the Terrebonne Facility. We expect evian to begin selling water bottles made from Loop™ PET initially in South Korea during the second half of 2022, and subsequently in other global markets. The waste plastic used to produce these bottles include polyester fibers from carpets and clothing which are considered unrecyclable and destined for landfill and other natural environments. This initiative reflects evian’s commitment to its stated 2025 goals for circularity and 100% recycled content.

Loop continues to work toward new brand and market introductions with additional consumer goods brand companies.

Technology Due Diligence Report

Loop's strategic partners, Suez and Danone,  among others, collectively engaged an independent, globally recognized third-party engineering firm to execute a thorough due diligence and technology validation report. We believe the final report, which was communicated in May 2022, validated and reinforced the quality, effectiveness, and scalability of Loop Industries’ technology.
Infinite Loop™ Bécancour, Québec

Our Infinite Loop™ Québec project (the “Quebec Project”) is aligned with the Government of Canada’s announced zero plastic waste goal by 2030. We believe the project could be critical infrastructure for customers to meet their 2025 and 2030 sustainability commitments and will assist the Government of Canada with achieving its Canada-wide zero plastic waste target and any proposed additional requirements, such as the requirement that all plastic packaging in Canada contain at least 50% recycled content by 2030. 

The Québec Project is currently contemplated as wholly-owned and operated by Loop which allows us to commercialize near our innovation and engineering teams located in Terrebonne, Québec.

We acquired the project site in Bécancour, Québec in May of 2021. During the year ended February 28, 2022, we completed initial site preparation work on the Bécancour, Québec project land for the planned Infinite Loop™ manufacturing facility. During the third and fourth quarters, the Company invested $1.14 million in civil construction costs which included building access roads, landscaping and drainage to ready the site for full construction. We are currently in the process of negotiating and entering into commercial contracts for the acquisition and fabrication of long lead item equipment to develop the project. In December 2021, the Company entered into an agreement for the purchase of long lead machinery and equipment in connection with the construction of our Infinite Loop™ manufacturing facility in Bécancour, Québec for up to $8.55 million over the next 9 months, based on certain milestones subject to various terms and conditions, including securing financing for the Quebec Project. We may enter into additional commitments to move the project ahead within our targeted final investment decision and construction timeframes.

On May 16, 2022, we announced a new multi-year agreement to supply Danone brands, including evian water, with Loop™ branded PET resin made from 100% recycled content. The resin is to be supplied from the planned Infinite Loop™ Bécancour manufacturing facility. We continue to work with existing and additional customers to sign definitive multi-year contracts for the Québec Project’s commercial output. We are exploring financing options to fully fund the project. Alternatives under exploration include incentive and financing programs supported by, or in partnership with, various levels of government.

The site offers attractive logistics being located on the St-Lawrence river and access to rail. The site size exceeds our project needs and we plan to sell a portion of the land to offset part of our project commitment.

Infinite Loop™ Europe

We announced on September 10, 2020 a strategic partnership with SUEZ GROUP (“Suez”), with the objective to build the first Infinite Loop™ manufacturing facility in Europe. With the combination of the Infinite Loop™ technology and the resource management expertise of Suez, this partnership seeks to respond to growth in demand in Europe from global beverage and consumer goods brand companies for virgin quality PET resin made from 100 percent recycled content. We are working with our partner Suez on acquiring the preferred project site, alignment of various levels of government support and additional steps for the project which include advancing permitting, site specific engineering, customer offtake contracts, feedstock and financing. 
Joint Venture with Indorama for Retrofit

In September 2018 we announced a joint venture with Indorama to retrofit certain PET manufacturing facilities. We entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement (the “LLC Agreement”), a Marketing Agreement (the “Marketing Agreement”) and a License Agreement (the “License Agreement”), with Indorama through our wholly-owned subsidiary Loop Innovations, LLC (“Loop Innovations”). Each company has 50/50 equity interest in the joint venture. We are contributing to the 50/50 joint venture an exclusive worldwide royalty-free license to use our proprietary technology to produce 100% sustainably produced PET resin in addition to our equity cash contribution. In 2019, the joint venture decided to increase the capacity of the planned Spartanburg, South Carolina plant due to customer demand to 40,000 metric tons per year from the initially planned 20,700 metric tons per year. The joint venture made a decision over the summer of 2020 that due to the COVID-19 pandemic it would temporarily delay work on the project. Since then, no expenditures have been incurred by the joint venture. Both joint venture partners currently remain committed to the project and we continue to discuss the project timetable.

To conform with the terms of the SK strategic partnership mentioned above, on June 18, 2021, the Company, Loop Innovations, Indorama and Indorama Loop Technologies, LLC (the “Indorama Joint Venture Company”) amended (i) the LLC Agreement, (ii) the Marketing Agreement and (iii) the License Agreement (collectively such amendments, the “Indorama Joint Venture Amendments”).

Under the Indorama Joint Venture Amendments, the Company, Indorama and the Indorama Joint Venture Company agreed to:


· | terminate Indorama’s right of first refusal under the LLC Agreement over any facility to produce products utilizing any waste-to-resin technology applying the PET depolymerization process of the Company; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | amend the non-compete obligations under the LLC Agreement to solely apply to the Company; 
· | limit the scope of the Company’s grant of intellectual property rights and the scope of the exclusivity rights of the Indorama Joint Venture Company for the retrofit of existing facilities under the License Agreement to North America and Europe; and
· | limit the scope of the Indorama Joint Venture Company’s permitted marketing rights under the Marketing Agreement to North America and Europe. 

Terrebonne Facility

As part of our plan for the commercialization of future Infinite Loop™ manufacturing facilities, we enhanced our Terrebonne, Québec pilot plant to become a small-scale PET depolymerization production facility. In addition to our research and development activities, this facility is used to deliver initial production volumes to support co-branded market launch campaigns with partners and customers and will also be used to showcase the Infinite Loop™ end-to-end technology and train operational teams in advance of the commissioning of the Infinite Loop™ full-scale commercial facilities. 

We made purchases of $9.55 million in machinery and equipment for the facility in the year ended February 28, 2022. We have completed the planned upgrades at the Terrebonne Facility which have increased its production capacity, giving us the opportunity to further support product campaigns with customers. In particular, we installed and began operation of new distillation columns in this period. We also advanced testing and production with the two installed depolymerization reactors which substantially increase the Terrebonne Facility’s depolymerization capacity and confirm the design and scale-up factors for the engineering of the planned commercial-scale facilities. In completing the upgrade of the Terrebonne facility to incorporate all key pieces of depolymerization equipment that will be used in the full-scale commercial facilities, we have achieved a key milestone in proving the effectiveness of our process. 

Materials for the marketing launch of the prototype evian Loop bottle to be introduced in the South Korean market in calendar 2022 were produced at the Terrebonne Facility. Also, we have entered into an agreement with On AG  to supply Loop™ PET  to be utilized in polyester fiber by the brand. This initial volume is planned to be supplied in 2022 and manufactured using MEG and DMT monomers produced at the Terrebonne Facility. The Terrebonne Facility continues to support our customers and partners with R&D and analytical capabilities.

We have also previously entered into an agreement to acquire PET polymerization equipment from Chemtex to manufacture Loop™ branded PET resin from the recycled monomers produced at the Terrebonne Facility and deliver initial production volume of Loop™ branded PET resin to customers.

In addition to the capital requirements for our commercialization, we continue to invest in strengthening our intellectual property portfolio, building a core competency in managing strategic relationships and continue enhancing our brand value with activities such as the co-branded marketing launch of an evian Loop bottle. Our research and development innovation center in Terrebonne, Québec will continue to push forward the continuous improvement of our technology.
