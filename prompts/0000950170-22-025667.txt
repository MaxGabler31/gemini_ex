BUSINESS
Overview
We are a biotechnology company that uses our robust, chemistry-driven approach and drug discovery capabilities to become a leader in the discovery and development of small molecule drugs, with an emphasis on treatments for viral infections. We discovered glecaprevir, the second of two protease inhibitors discovered and developed through our collaboration with AbbVie for the treatment of chronic infection with hepatitis C virus, or HCV. Glecaprevir is co-formulated as part of AbbVie’s leading brand of direct-acting antiviral, or DAA, combination treatment for HCV, which is marketed under the tradenames MAVYRET® (U.S.) and MAVIRET® (ex-U.S.) (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir). Our royalties from our AbbVie collaboration provide us funding to support our wholly-owned research and development programs, which are primarily focused on the following disease targets:
 •Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children and a significant cause of respiratory illness in older adults, with estimates suggesting that on average each year RSV leads to 3 million hospitalizations globally in children under 5 years old and 177,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. in adults over the age of 65; 
 •SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, as well as other coronaviruses, with estimates suggesting that COVID-19 has caused over 240,000 deaths and over 1.7 million hospitalizations in the U.S. in 2022 through October 29, with comparable, or at least significant, impact in other major populations of the world and with new variants still emerging;
 •Hepatitis B virus, or HBV, the most prevalent chronic hepatitis, which is estimated by the World Health Organization to affect close to 300 million individuals worldwide; and
 •Human metapneumovirus, or hMPV, an important, relatively recently identified cause of respiratory tract infections, particularly in children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals, with symptoms similar to RSV.
 We had $278.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term marketable securities at September 30, 2022. In fiscal 2022, we earned $86.2 million in product royalties on AbbVie’s net sales of its HCV regimens. We expect cash flows from our continuing HCV royalties and our existing financial resources will allow us to continue to fund our wholly-owned research and development programs into approximately the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.
Our Wholly-Owned Programs
Our primary wholly-owned research and development programs are in virology, namely RSV, SARS-CoV-2, HBV and hMPV:
•RSV: We have a clinical stage program for RSV, with two compounds in clinical trials – EDP-938 and EDP-323. EDP-938, which has Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, is a potent N-protein inhibitor of activity of both major subgroups of RSV, referred to as RSV-A and RSV-B. It has been investigated in a Phase 2a challenge study and is currently in three ongoing Phase 2 studies, each in a different patient population. In addition, we recently announced the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical study of EDP-323, an inhibitor of the RSV L-protein.
 oEDP-938 - N-protein Inhibitor Candidate: We have studied EDP-938 in two Phase 2 studies that were designed to be proof-of-concept and exploratory to understand better viral response in the context of RSV infection. These studies were conducted in otherwise healthy adults. The first study was the challenge study, which was reported out in mid-2019. The second study, known as RSVP, was designed to confirm the challenge study findings in an adult outpatient population with community-acquired RSV infection to provide additional information on symptom alleviation and viral load decline. In May 2022, we announced topline results for RSVP, noting that EDP-938 did not meet the primary endpoint of reduction in total symptom score compared to placebo, or the secondary antiviral endpoints. However, a statistically significant difference in the number of subjects achieving undetectable RSV RNA at the end of treatment at Day 5 was observed with EDP-938 compared to placebo (p=0.033). Further, EDP-938 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, consistent with that observed in approximately 500 subjects exposed to EDP-938 to date. Based on the growing safety profile of EDP-938 and differences in the range of the course of RSV infection in higher risk populations, which have always been our target populations, EDP-938 merits continued study. We believe that EDP-938 continues to have the greatest potential to show optimal efficacy in high-risk populations, as these patients have reduced RSV immunity, which manifests in a higher and longer duration of viral load and greater disease severity, allowing a bigger window to realize the full potential of EDP-938. We are continuing to evaluate EDP-938 in high-risk populations in the following ongoing and planned clinical studies, 


including pediatric patients, adult hematopoietic stem cell recipients and high-risk adults, all of which have significant unmet need:

▪RSVPEDs: RSVPEDs is a Phase 2 study in pediatric patients. This dose-ranging, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, will evaluate multiple ascending doses in up to four age cohorts to determine safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics, as well as a second part evaluating the selected dose for antiviral activity.
 ▪RSVTx: RSVTx is a Phase 2b study in adult hematopoietic cell transplant recipients with acute RSV infection and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. We plan to enroll approximately 200 adult subjects 18 to 75 years of age, within 72 hours of symptom onset, who will receive EDP-938 or placebo for 21 days and will be monitored for the incidence of lower respiratory tract complications within 28 days of enrollment. 
 ▪RSVHR: On October 3, 2022, we announced the initiation of a Phase 2b study called RSVHR in high-risk adults, including those who are older than 65 years of age and those who have asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, or congestive heart failure. Approximately 180 patients will be treated with 800 mg of EDP-938 or placebo for five days and evaluated for 28 days thereafter. The primary endpoint of the study is time to resolution of RSV lower respiratory tract disease symptoms.
 oThe prevalence of RSV has not been following any normal seasonal pattern since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The future incidence and timing of RSV infections remain highly unpredictable and thus may continue to impact enrollment in our ongoing Phase 2 RSV trials.
 oEDP-323 - L-protein Inhibitor Candidate: Our newest clinical candidate for RSV is a novel oral, direct-acting antiviral selectively targeting the RSV L-protein, a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme that contains multiple enzymatic activities required for RSV replication. EDP-323 has shown nanomolar potency against RSV-A and RSV-B in vitro and is not expected to have cross-resistance to other classes of inhibitors. EDP-323 has the potential to be used alone or in combination with other RSV mechanisms, such as EDP-938, to broaden the treatment window or addressable patient populations. We initiated a Phase 1 clinical study of EDP-323 in October 2022.
    •COVID-19: We have been leveraging our expertise in developing protease inhibitors to discover new compounds specifically designed to target the SARS-CoV-2 virus and potentially other coronaviruses. 
 oEDP-235 – Protease Inhibitor Candidate – Our lead clinical candidate for COVID-19, EDP-235, is an oral inhibitor of coronavirus 3CL protease, also referred to as 3CLpro or the main coronavirus protease, or Mpro, which has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, EDP-235 has potent antiviral activity against other human coronaviruses, enabling the potential for a pan-coronavirus treatment, including possibly coronaviruses that may infect human populations in the future. 
 ▪Phase 1 Study – In July 2022, we completed a Phase 1 study and reported positive topline results. This first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics, or PK, of oral EDP-235 in single ascending doses and multiple ascending doses for seven days, and the effect of food. Data from the Phase 1 study demonstrated EDP-235 was generally safe and well-tolerated up to 400 mg for seven days with strong exposure multiples over the EC90, which is a measure of potency, specifically the concentration of drug that results in 90% inhibition of viral replication in vitro. EDP-235 200 mg taken once daily with food resulted in mean trough plasma levels at steady state that were 3-fold and 7-fold over the plasma-protein-adjusted EC90 for the tested Alpha variant and Omicron variant, respectively, while 400 mg resulted in levels that were 6-fold and 13-fold over the plasma-protein-adjusted EC90 for the respective variants. These target exposure multiples were achieved without the need for ritonavir boosting and its associated drug-drug interactions. EDP-235 is projected to have four times higher drug levels in lung tissue compared to plasma, which would be expected to drive the 400 mg multiples to 28-fold and 52-fold for the respective variants. Adverse events were infrequent and mild. 
 ▪Phase 2 Study – In November 2022, we initiated SPRINT (SARS-Cov-2 Protease Inhibitor Treatment), a Phase 2 clinical trial of EDP-235 in non-hospitalized, symptomatic adults with mild or moderate COVID-19. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of 200 mg and 400 mg once-daily doses of EDP-235 compared to placebo. The study will enroll approximately 200 non-hospitalized, symptomatic patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are not at increased risk for developing severe disease. Patients will be eligible to participate if they have had symptoms for five days or less and have not received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or been infected with SARS-CoV-2 within 90 days of enrollment. Patients will receive EDP-235 orally with food at a dose of 200 mg or 400 mg or placebo once daily for five days. The primary objective of the study includes evaluation of safety 


and tolerability, and secondary objectives include pharmacokinetics and multiple virology measures to guide dose selection for other trials.
 oWe are also researching additional compounds that might be eligible to be designated for clinical development for SARS-CoV-2.
 •HBV: Our lead clinical candidate for the treatment of chronic infection with hepatitis B virus, or HBV, is EDP-514, a core inhibitor that displays potent anti-HBV activity in vitro at multiple points in the HBV lifecycle. Our goal is to develop a combination therapy approach, including existing approved treatments such as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or NUC, with EDP-514 and one or more other mechanisms, which could lead to a functional cure for patients with chronic HBV infection. We are in the process of seeking other compounds that could be developed with EDP-514 for such a treatment regimen.
 oEDP-514 - Core Inhibitor Candidate - In June 2022, final data from two of our Phase 1b studies of EDP-514 were presented at The International Liver CongressTM 2022. EDP-514, which has Fast Track designation from the FDA, has been shown to be safe and potent in two different chronic HBV patient populations – those who have a high viral load, whom we refer to as viremic patients, and those who are on a treatment with a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, whom we refer to as NUC-suppressed patients. Based on these data, we remain convinced that EDP-514 has the potential to be a best-in-class core inhibitor for HBV.
 
•hMPV: Human metapneumovirus, or hMPV, a virus that is a significant cause of respiratory tract infections, or RTIs, particularly in children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. It is the second most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children, with symptoms similar to RSV. The viral structure and lifecycle of hMPV are also similar to RSV. We have been optimizing nanomolar inhibitor leads against hMPV and are working toward selecting our first development candidate for this indication in 2023.
 We have utilized our internal chemistry and drug discovery capabilities to generate all of our development-stage programs. We continue to invest substantial resources in research programs to discover back-up compounds as well as new compounds targeting different mechanisms of action, both in our disease areas of focus as well as potentially in other disease areas.
 Our Out-Licensed Products
 HCV: Two protease inhibitors developed through our Collaborative Development and License Agreement with AbbVie have been clinically tested, manufactured, and commercialized by AbbVie as part of its combination regimens for HCV. We have received the full $330.0 million of contractual milestone payments under the agreement related to clinical development and commercialization regulatory approvals of these regimens in major markets, and we continue to earn royalties on sales of those regimens.
 Glecaprevir is the HCV protease inhibitor we discovered that was developed by AbbVie in a fixed-dose combination with its NS5A inhibitor, pibrentasvir, for the treatment of chronic HCV. This patented combination, currently marketed under the brand names MAVYRET® (U.S.) and MAVIRET® (ex-U.S.), is referred to in this report as MAVYRET/MAVIRET. This regimen is a once-daily, all-oral, fixed-dose, ribavirin-free treatment for HCV genotypes 1-6, or GT1-6, which is referred to as being pan-genotypic. In the U.S., EU and Japan it is approved as an 8-week treatment for patients with and without compensated cirrhosis and new to treatment. Today, these patients are estimated to represent the majority of HCV patients in over 50 countries where MAVYRET/MAVIRET is sold by AbbVie and where MAVYRET/MAVIRET remains the only 8-week pan-genotypic HCV treatment. The first protease inhibitor developed through this collaboration, paritaprevir, is part of Abbvie’s initial HCV regimens, which have been almost entirely replaced by MAVYRET/MAVIRET. Since August 2017, substantially all of our royalty revenue has been derived from AbbVie’s net sales of MAVYRET/MAVIRET. Our ongoing royalty revenues from this regimen consist of annually tiered, double-digit, per-product royalties on 50% of the calendar year net sales of the 2-DAA glecaprevir/pibrentasvir combination in MAVYRET/MAVIRET. The annual royalty tiers return to the lowest tier for sales on and after each January 1.
Our Strategy
Our primary objective is to become a leader in the discovery and development of treatments for viral infections to provide new therapies for patients with unmet medical needs. Our principal focus is on antiviral targets for viruses such as RSV, SARS-CoV-2, HBV and hMPV, which in most cases are therapeutic areas that have attracted research and development efforts of many competitors. Our strategy includes the following key elements:
•Advance clinical development of novel virology product candidates for RSV, SARS-CoV-2, HBV and hMPV. We have ongoing clinical studies of three compounds discovered in our research programs in the disease areas of RSV and SARS-CoV-2. We believe each of these diseases represents a substantial medical need for an effective, or more effective, treatment. 
 •Invest in research and development of compounds in new disease areas or add to our clinical candidates in RSV, SARS-CoV-2, HBV and hMPV. We are continuing to invest significant resources in our research programs in our efforts to identify and advance additional novel compounds that have the potential to address significant unmet medical needs in our primary disease areas, as well as others. We may also explore clinically other diseases where our assets could play a role. In addition, we may seek to augment our product candidate pipeline through the acquisition or in-licensing of external assets and/or technologies in one or more of our disease areas of focus.
 •Collaborate or out-license, where and when appropriate, with pharmaceutical partners to create combination therapies and accelerate the development and commercialization of our proprietary compounds. We are prepared to join forces, where and when appropriate, with collaborators with compounds targeting other mechanisms of action in diseases such as HBV, where there is the potential for better treatments with combination therapies. Our decisions regarding our proprietary programs will be based on the results of our early phase clinical studies and the potential for combinations with one or more drugs targeting other mechanisms of action in these diseases. 
 •Continue to use our existing resources and future cash flow from our AbbVie collaboration to fund our research and development activities. We expect our existing financial resources and future royalty payments from our AbbVie collaboration will provide us resources to fund our research and development programs into approximately the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. These resources will allow us to continue to advance compounds in clinical development and to progress the most promising candidates at least through proof-of-concept trials. Further development of any compound as a monotherapy or in combinations with other therapeutic agents when we believe such combinations will provide the most promising opportunities will likely require additional financial resources.

Our RSV Program
Background and Overview of RSV
Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is a virus that infects the lungs and is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children and a significant cause of respiratory illness in older adults. Almost all children are infected at least once before they are 2 years old, and about a half are infected twice, resulting in over 2 million outpatient visits in young children. Hospitalization rates due to RSV are approximately 16 times higher than for influenza among children aged less than 1 year. On average each year in the U.S., RSV leads to 58,000 hospitalizations in children under 5 years old and 177,000 in adults older than 65 years old. RSV is estimated to cause 100–500 deaths annually in children under 5 years old and 14,000 deaths in adults over 65 years old in the U.S. There are currently no safe and effective therapies for RSV infection.
Scientific Background
 RSV is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. The RSV genome consists of ten genes that encode for 11 proteins, namely NS1, NS2, N, P, M, SH, G, F, M2-1, M2-2, and L. The F and G proteins are the predominant target proteins for RSV vaccines. Similarly, small molecule therapeutics have focused primarily on the F (or fusion) protein, while some efforts have targeted the N and L proteins. There are two major subgroups of RSV, designated RSV-A and RSV-B, each of which contains numerous genotypes. Both groups are viewed as capable of causing RSV infections that can result in hospitalization.
Several companies are seeking to develop antiviral treatments for RSV infection in adult and pediatric patients. Ark Biosciences (Ziresovir – fusion inhibitor), Pfizer/ReViral (acquired in June 2022) (sinsunatovir – fusion inhibitor and RV299 – N inhibitor), and Merck (molnupiravir – polymerase inhibitor) have compounds in clinical development. Synagis, a prophylactic, monoclonal-antibody-based treatment from AstraZeneca, which is commercialized by AbbVie outside the U.S., is approved for infants considered at high risk for RSV infection; however, studies have found that most young children with RSV infection were previously healthy, and thus would not normally be prescribed prophylactic treatment. AstraZeneca/Sanofi (Beyfortus/nirsevimab – filed in U.S./EU) and Merck (clesrovimab – Phase 3) are developing long-acting versions of the monoclonal antibody for prophylaxis use in infants. In addition, a number of companies have RSV vaccines in development, primarily directed at prevention of RSV infection, and some companies are also evaluating vaccines in a therapeutic mode for treatment of established RSV infection.

Our Approach to the Treatment of RSV
While a number of companies are developing potential approaches geared toward the F protein (or fusion protein, responsible for mediating viral entry of RSV into host cells), we are focused on other mechanisms, such as the N-protein and the L-protein, that target the replication process of RSV. It is possible that N-protein and L-protein inhibitors may also be effective treatments at later stages of infection.
EDP-938, Our N-Protein Inhibitor
 Through our internal chemistry efforts, we identified our lead clinical candidate, EDP-938. During preclinical studies, EDP-938 demonstrated a greater than 4-log reduction in viral load in an animal model challenged with RSV. Further, EDP-938 maintained antiviral potency across all clinical isolates tested in vitro, as well as virus that was resistant to fusion inhibitors. The compound inhibited RSV at a post-entry replication step and maintained its activity in vitro when given 24 hours post infection. In addition, combination studies of EDP-938 with other types of RSV inhibitors, such as fusion inhibitors, showed synergistic antiviral effects.
 We have studied EDP-938 in two Phase 2 studies that were designed to be proof-of-concept and exploratory to better understand antiviral response in the context of RSV infection. These studies were conducted in otherwise healthy adults. The first study was a challenge study, which had a data readout in June 2019. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, human challenge study of 115 healthy adult subjects. Data from this study demonstrated that EDP-938 was safe and well-tolerated and achieved highly statistically significant reductions (p=<0.001) in RSV viral load and symptoms compared to placebo. See Ahmad et al, N Engl J Med 2022; 386:655-666. The second study, known as RSVP, was designed to confirm the challenge study findings in an adult outpatient population with mild and self-resolving community-acquired, RSV infection to provide us additional information on symptom alleviation and viral load decline. In May 2022, we announced topline results for RSVP, noting that EDP-938 did not meet the primary endpoint of reduction in total symptom score compared to placebo, or the secondary antiviral endpoints. However, a statistically significant difference in the number of subjects achieving undetectable RSV RNA at the end of treatment at Day 5 was observed with EDP-938 compared to placebo (p=0.033). Although patients were treated within 48 hours of symptom onset, the viral load and symptoms had already peaked and were declining, indicating RSV infection resolves quickly in this otherwise healthy population. Further, EDP-938 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, consistent with that observed in approximately 500 subjects exposed to date. Based on the growing safety profile of EDP-938 and differences in the range of the course of RSV infection in higher risk populations, which have always been our target populations, we are progressing development of EDP-938 in patients at high-risk for developing severe infection leading to hospitalization or death. EDP-938 has the greatest potential to show optimal efficacy in these high-risk populations with significant unmet need, as these patients have reduced RSV immunity, which manifests in a higher and longer duration of viral replication and greater disease severity, allowing a bigger window to realize the full potential of EDP-938.
We are now studying EDP-938 in three additional RSV studies:
•RSVPEDs is a Phase 2 dose-ranging, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in pediatric patients. We plan to enroll approximately 90 infants and children aged 28 days to 36 months with RSV-associated respiratory tract infection, who will be dosed in up to four age cohorts and will receive EDP-938 or a placebo for five days. The study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 will evaluate multiple ascending doses in each age cohort, with a primary endpoint of safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. Part 2 will evaluate the selected dose from Part 1 across the age cohorts, with a primary endpoint of antiviral activity. 
    •RSVTx is a Phase 2b study in adult hematopoietic cell transplant recipients with acute RSV infection and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. This study is designed to enroll approximately 200 adult subjects 18 to 75 years of age, within 72 hours of symptom onset, who will receive EDP-938 or placebo for 21 days. The primary endpoint is the incidence of lower respiratory tract complications within 28 days of enrollment, while secondary endpoints include change from baseline in RSV RNA viral load, safety and pharmacokinetics. 
    •RSVHR is a Phase 2b study initiated in October 2022 in high-risk adults, including those who are older than 65 years of age, have asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, or congestive heart failure. Approximately 180 patients will be treated with 800 mg of EDP-938 or placebo for five days and evaluated for 28 days thereafter. The study will include non-hospitalized adult subjects with up to 72 hours of respiratory tract infection symptoms who test positive for RSV and negative for influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. The primary endpoint of the study is time to resolution of RSV lower respiratory tract disease symptoms as assessed by the Respiratory Infection Intensity and Impact Questionnaire, or RiiQ, symptom scale through Day 33. Secondary endpoints include additional clinical efficacy measures and antiviral activity compared to placebo, pharmacokinetics, and safety of EDP-938.


EDP-323, Our RSV L-Protein Inhibitor:
In addition to our N-protein inhibitor, EDP-938, our newest clinical candidate for RSV is EDP-323, a novel oral, direct-acting antiviral selectively targeting the RSV L-protein, a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme that contains multiple enzymatic activities required for RSV replication. EDP-323 has shown nanomolar potency against RSV-A and RSV-B in vitro and is not expected to have cross-resistance to other classes of inhibitors. EDP-323 has the potential to be used alone or in combination with other RSV mechanisms, such as EDP-938, to broaden the treatment window or addressable patient populations.
We initiated a Phase 1 clinical study of EDP-323 in October 2022. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first-in-human Phase 1 study will enroll approximately 80 healthy subjects ranging in age from 18 to 65 years old to evaluate the safely, tolerability and pharmacokinetics, or PK, of EDP-323 with a single-ascending dose phase, including a two-part food effect, or FE, cohort, and a multiple-ascending dose phase. All single-ascending dose, or SAD, and multiple-ascending dose cohorts will enroll eight participants who will be randomized to receive EDP-323 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. The SAD/FE cohort will enroll ten subjects randomized in a 4:1 ratio.
 Our SARS-CoV-2 Program
Background and Overview of SARS-CoV-2
 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS‑CoV‑2, is the virus that causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), the respiratory illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV. Most people infected with the virus experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover over time. However, some patients will have more severe symptoms requiring hospitalization and may experience severe life-threatening complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, which may trigger a systemic multi-organ collapse. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. There are also many patients who experience continuing effects of COVID-19, often referred to as “long COVID”, and there still is little known about the enduring effects of the disease. As of November 1, 2022, the World Health Organization estimated that there were approximately 620 million reported cases of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, resulting in approximately 6.5 million deaths, while many estimates of the number of infections far exceed the reported cases. While effective vaccines are available, uptake has not been optimal. In addition, breakthrough infection can occur because the vaccines are not 100% effective, especially against emerging variants. With the continuing prevalence of COVID-19 globally, there is heightened risk of a further mutation of the virus that could evade one or more of the current vaccines. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective, safe, oral, antiviral treatments.
Scientific Background
 All coronaviruses have a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA (+ssRNA) genome, which is the largest known genome for an RNA virus. The overall structure of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is shared with other betacoronaviruses, namely MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. These viruses encode two cysteine proteases, which are enzymes that break down, or cleave, proteins into smaller pieces and are indispensable for viral replication: 3C-like protease, or 3CLpro (also known as the main protease, or Mpro) and papain-like protease, or PLpro. 3CLpro cleaves at 11 sites in the viral polyprotein, which is required for creating 16 separate, non-structural proteins that constitute the structural complex that enables replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and PLpro cleaves three other sites within the viral polyprotein as well as multiple host proteins. Due primarily to their central role in viral replication, and the previous success of strategies targeting viral proteases, 3CLpro and Plpro are highly attractive targets for the development of direct-acting antiviral agents.

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, hundreds of existing antivirals and other compounds were initially screened for activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the hopes of quickly finding an effective treatment. Some of these compounds progressed into clinical testing, including remdesivir, which is currently the only FDA-approved antiviral for COVID-19. Remdesivir was originally developed for treatment of the Ebola virus, but it showed efficacy in COVID-19. Currently, there are two Emergency Use Authorizations of oral antiviral treatments for non-hospitalized, high-risk patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: Paxlovid, a 3CL protease inhibitor, and Molnupiravir, a polymerase inhibitor. Additionally, there are several companies developing oral direct acting antivirals for SARS-CoV-2 that are currently in Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies, including Shionogi, Gilead (an oral formulation of remdesivir), Toyama, Pardes, Atea, SyneuRx and Todos, as well as additional compounds in Phase 1 studies.
Merck reported results from a Phase 3 study of molnupiravir in high-risk outpatients infected with COVID-19, which showed a 50% reduction in hospitalization or death through one month after treatment compared to placebo. Molnupiravir is currently approved in the UK and U.S. under EUA but is limited to situations where other FDA-authorized treatments for COVID-19 are inaccessible or are not clinically appropriate. Pfizer also reported results from a Phase 3 study of Paxlovid in high-risk outpatients infected with COVID-19, which showed an 85% reduction in hospitalization or death through one month after treatment compared to placebo (89% if treated within 3 days of symptom onset). Paxlovid is dosed twice daily in combination with a low dose of ritonavir, which has significant drug interactions with numerous other medications. These data indicate the opportunity for novel SARS-CoV-2 direct-acting antivirals and highlight the need to bring forward safe, efficacious and convenient treatments. We have been leveraging our expertise in protease inhibitors to discover new compounds specifically designed to target the SARS-CoV-2 virus and potentially other coronaviruses.
EDP-235, Our Lead, Oral, 3CL Protease Inhibitor
 Our lead clinical candidate for COVID-19 is EDP-235, an oral inhibitor of coronavirus 3CL protease, which has been granted Fast Track designation from the FDA. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, EDP-235 has potent antiviral activity against other human coronaviruses, enabling the potential for a pan-coronavirus treatment, including possibly coronaviruses that may infect human populations in the future.
In a biochemical assay, EDP-235 inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease with an IC50 of 5.8 nM. Importantly, this activity was retained against proteases from SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron. EDP-235 potently blocked the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in multiple cellular models, including primary human airway epithelial cells, where an EC90 of 33 nM was observed. Additionally, EDP-235 was shown to have potent antiviral activity across other human coronaviruses. In comparison to preclinical data from other direct acting antivirals in development for COVID-19 today, EDP-235 appears to be among the most potent against SARS-CoV-2 in cellular assays.

 EDP-235 showed good human Caco-2 cell permeability and a low plasma clearance in human liver microsomes. Consistent with this in vitro data, EDP-235 had robust plasma exposure with an oral bioavailability of 95% in rats. Moreover, EDP-235 had favorable in vivo penetration into multiple target tissues, including lung, kidney, liver, and heart. These results indicate that EDP-235 has good oral bioavailability and target tissue distribution compared to other antivirals in development for SARS-CoV-2 today. Based on allometric scaling, EDP-235 is projected to have a long half-life of 16 hours with an efficacious dose of 100 to 500 mg once-daily in humans. Taken together, these data indicate that EDP-235 has the potential for once-daily oral dosing with a low pill burden. These predictions are now supported by Phase 1 pharmacokinetic data at a 200mg and 400mg once-daily dose.

Clinical studies of EDP-235 consist of the following:
•Phase 1 Study: In July 2022, we completed a Phase 1 study of EDP-235 and reported positive topline results. This first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled healthy volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics, or PK, of oral EDP-235 in single ascending doses and multiple ascending doses for seven days, and the effect of food. Data from the Phase 1 study demonstrated EDP-235 was generally safe and well-tolerated up to 400 mg for seven days with infrequent adverse events, the majority of which were mild. Results demonstrated strong exposure multiples over the EC90, which is a measure of potency, specifically the concentration of drug that results in 90% inhibition of viral replication in vitro. EDP-235 200 mg taken once daily with food resulted in mean trough plasma levels at steady state that were 3-fold and 7-fold over the plasma-protein-adjusted EC90 for the tested Alpha variant and Omicron variant, respectively, while 400 mg resulted in levels that were 6-fold and 13-fold over the plasma-protein-adjusted EC90 for the respective variants. These target exposure multiples were achieved without the need for ritonavir boosting and its associated drug-drug interactions. EDP-235 is projected to have four times higher drug levels in lung tissue compared to plasma, which would be expected to drive the 400 mg multiples to 28-fold and 52-fold for the respective variants. 
 •Phase 2 SPRINT Study: In November 2022, we initiated SPRINT (SARS-Cov-2 Protease Inhibitor Treatment), a Phase 2 clinical trial of EDP-235 in non-hospitalized, symptomatic adults with mild or moderate COVID-19. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of 200 mg and 400 mg once-daily doses of EDP-235 compared to placebo. The study will enroll approximately 200 non-hospitalized, symptomatic patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are not at increased risk for developing severe disease. Patients will be eligible to participate if they have had symptoms for five days or less and have not received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or been infected with SARS-CoV-2 within 90 days of enrollment. Patients will receive EDP-235 orally with food at a dose of 200 mg or 400 mg or placebo once daily for five days. The primary objective of the study includes evaluation of safety and tolerability, and secondary objectives include pharmacokinetics and multiple virology measures to guide dose selection for other trials.
 Our HBV Program
Background and Overview of HBV
Hepatitis B virus, or HBV, can cause potentially life-threatening liver infection. The virus is transmitted through contact with the blood or other bodily fluids of an infected person. It is estimated that close to 300 million people worldwide are chronically infected, and 15-40% of patients with chronic HBV infection develop chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, liver cancer, or liver decompensation. HBV is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and need for liver transplantation. It is estimated that more than 820,000 people worldwide died in 2019 due to complications of HBV.
 Current approaches to treatment include interferon therapy and/or inhibitors of HBV reverse transcriptase, the enzyme responsible for viral DNA synthesis, which is necessary for HBV replication. Treatment with interferon offers modest cure rates, and is accompanied by serious side effects, including flu-like symptoms, fatigue, headache and nausea. Reverse transcriptase inhibitors can be very effective at suppressing the virus but often require lifelong therapy and rarely result in full eradication of the virus from the liver. New treatments that can provide functional cures to chronically-infected patients are urgently needed.
Scientific Background
 HBV is a partially double-stranded DNA virus with a complex life cycle. There are multiple mechanisms associated with HBV replication that could potentially be targeted with new drugs, and combination approaches may ultimately provide the most effective therapy for HBV. Mechanisms under study for HBV include:
 •Entry inhibitors that interfere with the initial binding of HBV to hepatocytes, thus preventing new infection from occurring. 
 •Inhibitors of covalently closed circular DNA, or cccDNA, the template for HBV replication, most of which act in an indirect manner, such as preventing formation of cccDNA or silencing its transcription. 
 •RNA silencing of gene expression (siRNA’s and ASO’s) has the potential to significantly reduce HBV RNA, HBV DNA, and HBV protein levels. 
 •Inhibition of the hepatitis B core protein, which plays a critical role in viral replication, intracellular trafficking, and maintenance of chronic infections. 
 •The modulators of the human immune system, or immunomodulators, are another major mechanism being researched, including agonists of toll-like receptors, modulators of apoptotic signaling, and checkpoint inhibition, as well as therapeutic vaccines. 



While there are antiviral medications prescribed for HBV that can suppress HBV DNA, they generally have low cure rates, resulting in the need for lifelong treatment. Many companies are seeking to develop new HBV drugs that alone or in combination with other mechanisms could lead to a functional cure for HBV. Altimmune, Arbutus, Ascletis, Assembly, Gilead, Green Cross, GSK/Ionis, HEC Pharma, Johnson & Johnson/Janssen, Qilu, Replicor, Roche, Vaccitech, VBI Vaccines and Vir Biotechnology have Phase 2 programs in progress, with many of these companies conducting earlier stage programs as well. In addition, several companies have Phase 1 or earlier stage HBV programs.
 We believe that HBV, like HIV and HCV, will be optimally treated with multiple agents that have different mechanisms, and therefore seek to develop a combination regimen. We initially focused on new core inhibitors that we expect to have an impact on capsid assembly and possibly interfere with other viral processes. Core inhibitors, also known as capsid assembly modulators or core protein allosteric modulators, are a novel class of replication inhibitors that have been shown to act at multiple steps in the HBV lifecycle. These inhibitors are expected to prevent proper uncoating, nuclear import, assembly, and recycling. This approach is supported by clinical validation, demonstrating reduction of viral RNA and DNA in chronic HBV patients in Phase 2 clinical studies.
EDP-514
 EDP-514, our most advanced novel core inhibitor, displays potent anti-HBV activity in vitro at multiple points in the HBV lifecycle and has been studied in two Phase 1b studies in patients with chronic HBV.
•In the first study, which evaluated EDP-514 in NUC-suppressed chronic HBV patients, EDP-514 led to a maximum HBV RNA reduction of 2.3 log in HBeAg-negative and 2.8 log in HBeAg-positive subjects in the EDP-514 arms compared to 1.2 log in placebo. For the EDP-514 800 mg subjects, five of six subjects had either non-detectable or very low levels of HBV RNA at baseline; consequently, the effect of EDP-514 on HBV RNA could not be assessed in these subjects. There were no instances of virologic failure. Overall, EDP-514 was generally safe and well-tolerated at 200, 400 and 800 mg doses for 28 days in NUC-suppressed chronic HBV patients. EDP-514 was rapidly absorbed and its exposure increased with increasing multiple doses. EDP-514 exhibited PK suitable for once daily oral dosing. 
 •A separate Phase 1b study was conducted in patients with chronic HBV infection who were not previously on HBV therapy and had high levels of virus in their blood, whom we refer to as viremic HBV patients. Results demonstrated that EDP-514 was safe and well-tolerated through 28 days of treatment, displayed pharmacokinetics supportive of once-daily dosing. Mean HBV DNA reductions of 2.9, 3.3, and 3.5 logs were observed at 28 days for the 200 mg, 400 mg, and 800 mg cohorts, respectively, compared to 0.2 log in the placebo cohort. Mean HBV RNA reductions in the three viremic treatment cohorts were at least 2 logs compared to a 0.02 log reduction in the placebo group. Our goal is to develop a combination therapy approach, including existing approved treatments such as a NUC, with EDP-514 and one or more other mechanisms, which could lead to a functional cure for patients with chronic HBV infection. We are actively pursuing opportunities for internal or external development of this combination approach.
 Our hMPV Program
 Background and Overview of hMPV
Human metapneumovirus, or hMPV, is an important cause of acute respiratory tract infections, or RTIs, and is associated with considerable morbidity, particularly in children, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Broader use of molecular diagnostic testing has increased identification and awareness of hMPV as an important cause of upper and lower respiratory infection. It is the second most common cause of lower RTIs in children behind RSV. Nearly every child will be infected with hMPV by the age of 5 and reinfection occurs throughout life. Rates of hospitalization in children are highest in the first year of life but occur throughout early childhood. Many studies report the peak age of hospitalization between 6 and 12 months of age, which is later than for RSV.
 In otherwise healthy younger adults, hMPV infection is typically mild, however infection leads to increased disease severity and high morbidity and mortality rates in the elderly. A retrospective study in Canada showed that 46% of hMPV cases were from patients >65 years old, and 60% of these elderly patients were hospitalized. A subsequent study reported that at least 50% of elderly patients infected during an hMPV outbreak in a long-term care facility developed bronchitis or pneumonia, leading to 50% mortality. See Shafagati N, Williams J. F1000Res. 2018 Feb 1;7:135. There are no approved vaccines or therapeutics available for hMPV.
 Scientific Background
 hMPV is a paramyxovirus that is closely related to RSV. It is a negative-sense, non-segmented, single-stranded RNA virus. The genome is about 13,000 nucleotides with 8 genes encoding for 9 proteins, including a nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), matrix-2 proteins (M2-1 and M2-2), small hydrophobic (SH) protein, glycoprotein (G), and large (L) polymerase protein. Though similar to RSV, hMPV has a different gene order and lacks the non-structural proteins (NS1 & NS2) of

RSV. Nucleotide analysis of hMPV’s fusion (F) and glycoprotein (G) genes class hMPV into four distinct groups: A1, A2, B1, and B2. Although both genotypes A and B can co-circulate in a given community, the dominant lineage tends to vary year by year.
 As in other paramyxoviruses, replication is dependent on several viral proteins (N, L, and P) that form a multiprotein viral replication complex in cells, providing multiple potential targets for drug discovery of replication inhibitors.
We have been optimizing nanomolar inhibitor leads against this virus and are working toward completing toxicology testing and selecting our first development candidate for this indication in 2023.
 Our Out-Licensed HCV Protease Inhibitor Products
Background and Overview of HCV Market
HCV is a virus that is a common cause of viral hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver. HCV is typically contracted by contact with the blood or other body fluids of another individual infected with HCV. HCV is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, liver failure and cancer, and the leading cause of death from liver disease in the United States. HCV disease progression occurs over a period of 20 to 30 years, with the majority of HCV-infected individuals generally exhibiting no major symptoms in the early stages of the disease. Therefore, until a major symptom is diagnosed, many individuals are unaware they are infected and live undiagnosed without seeking treatment. For that reason, combined with the new availability of effective treatments for HCV, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, issued new guidelines in 2013 recommending screening for all Americans born between the years 1945 and 1965 so that HCV-infected individuals will be aware of their condition and can consider treatment options.
An estimated 58 million people worldwide are chronically infected with HCV and have an increased risk of eventually developing liver cirrhosis or liver cancer. Approximately 290,000 people die every year from HCV-related liver diseases. According to the CDC, the incidence rate of acute HCV has increased 15% since 2019, with an estimated 66,700 new infections in 2020, the most recent year for which the CDC has published data. During 2020, 41 states reported a total of 107,300 newly identified chronic HCV cases in 2020, corresponding to 40.7 chronic HCV cases per 100,000. HCV-associated deaths during 2020 increased 4% (3.45 deaths per 100,000 people), compared to 2019 (3.33 deaths per 100,000 people). We believe that the chronically infected population remains significantly untreated, even with the introduction of several new treatment regimens beginning in 2013.
 The approved treatments for HCV have provided significant benefit to HCV patients. To date, these treatments have cure rates approaching 100% in several subpopulations. Medical practice defines a “cure” as the point at which there is no quantifiable virus in a patient’s blood for a sustained period of time after cessation of therapy, which is often referred to as a sustained virologic response, or SVR. For AbbVie’s MAVYRET/MAVIRET regimen, the majority of chronic HCV patients only require 8 weeks of treatment compared to 12 weeks with other HCV regimens, including Gilead’s EPCLUSA® and HARVONI® in almost all HCV genotypes.
 Since the introduction of Gilead’s Harvoni® and AbbVie’s VIEKIRA PAK® in late 2014, the reported worldwide sales of the leading HCV therapies have declined from $23 billion in 2015 to $3.6 billion in 2021. Through the first nine months of calendar 2022, reported worldwide net sales were $2.5 billion. HCV sales have declined since their peak in 2015 due to payers obtaining additional discounts, competitive market dynamics and a decline in the number of patients treated annually after the initial wave of diagnosed chronic HCV patients who had urgency for treatment. Despite the high numbers of HCV patients that have been successfully treated, there remains a large population of chronic HCV-infected patients who have yet to be treated with one of the newer “high cure” regimens. In addition, and as noted above, new HCV infections (principally in association with IV drug use) are an ongoing target population for treatment.
 COVID-19 has also impacted new HCV patient volumes, HCV diagnoses, HCV prescriptions and sales of MAVYRET/MAVIRET worldwide. While new HCV infections are continuing, at this time it is uncertain when and the extent to which treatment of new HCV patients and revenues will return to pre-COVID-19 levels.
Our Out-Licensed Products in AbbVie’s Marketed Therapies
Glecaprevir - Our protease inhibitor, glecaprevir, which is part of the latest HCV regimen from AbbVie, was developed by AbbVie in combination with pibrentasvir, AbbVie’s second NS5A inhibitor. This co-formulated combination, marketed under the tradenames MAVYRET® (U.S.) and MAVIRET® (ex-U.S.), contains two novel DAAs that target and inhibit proteins essential for the replication of HCV. MAVYRET/MAVIRET is approved in the U.S., EU, Japan and numerous other countries globally as an 8-week, pan-genotypic, fixed-dose combination treatment, dosed once-daily as three oral tablets, taken with food, for chronic HCV patients without cirrhosis and new to treatment. MAVYRET/MAVIRET is also approved as a treatment for patients with specific treatment challenges, including those GT-1 patients not cured by prior treatment experience with either a protease inhibitor or an NS5A inhibitor (but not both), and in patients with limited treatment options, such as those with severe chronic kidney disease, or CKD, or those with genotype 3 chronic HCV. MAVYRET/MAVIRET is approved for use in patients across all stages of CKD with any of the major HCV genotypes (GT1-6). The approvals of MAVYRET/MAVIRET are supported by data from nine registrational studies in AbbVie’s

clinical development program, which evaluated more than 2,300 patients in 27 countries across all major HCV genotypes (GT1-6) and special populations:
 •8 weeks for treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotic patients: In November 2016, results from several Phase 3 studies of this combination demonstrated 97.5% of chronic HCV infected patients without cirrhosis and new to treatment across all major genotypes (GT1-6) achieved sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment, referred to as SVR12, with just 8 weeks of MAVYRET/MAVIRET treatment.
 •8 weeks with chronic kidney disease: Results were also presented from AbbVie’s EXPEDITION-4 study in chronic HCV patients with chronic kidney disease, or CKD, in which 98% of patients (n=102/104) across all major genotypes (GT1-6) achieved SVR12 with 12 weeks of treatment with MAVYRET/MAVIRET.
 •8 weeks for GT-3: Data from AbbVie’s ENDURANCE-3 study were presented at the 2017 ILC, demonstrating that 95% of patients with challenging-to-treat, genotype 3, or GT3, chronic HCV infection, without cirrhosis and new to treatment, achieved SVR12 after 8 weeks of treatment with MAVYRET/MAVIRET.
 •8 weeks for compensated cirrhosis: Based on data from AbbVie’s EXPEDITION-8 study, which demonstrated that with 8 weeks of MAVYRET treatment, 100 percent (n=273/273) of genotype 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 patients achieved a sustained virologic response 8 weeks after treatment (SVR8) per protocol analysis. Based on this data and a second cohort of the study in GT3 chronic HCV-infected patients, MAVYRET is now approved for all genotypes with compensated cirrhosis in the U.S. 
 Paritaprevir - The first protease inhibitor developed through our collaboration with AbbVie, paritaprevir, is part of AbbVie’s 3-DAA regimen approved for the treatment of genotype 1 and 4 HCV patients. This 3-DAA combination was sold as VIEKIRA PAK® (paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir/dasabuvir) in the U.S. from December 2014 to December 2018, and as VIEKIRAX®+EXVIERA® in most other jurisdictions, for non-cirrhotic patients and those with early stage, or compensated, cirrhosis. These regimens have been almost entirely replaced by MAVYRET/MAVIRET.
Collaboration and License Agreement with AbbVie
 We entered into a Collaborative Development and License Agreement with Abbott Laboratories in November 2006 to develop and commercialize HCV NS3 and NS3/4A protease inhibitors. The agreement, which was amended in January and December 2009, was then assigned to AbbVie Inc. on January 1, 2013 in connection with Abbott’s transfer of its research-based pharmaceuticals business to AbbVie. Under the agreement, we have granted AbbVie an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, including a right to grant sublicenses, to specified intellectual property, including several issued U.S. patents, relating to protease inhibitors. We also granted AbbVie access to our drug discovery capabilities in the HCV NS3 and NS3/4A protease inhibitor field. AbbVie granted us a co-exclusive (together with AbbVie), royalty-free, fully paid license, without the right to grant sublicenses, to certain of AbbVie’s intellectual property, AbbVie’s interest in joint intellectual property and improvements discovered by AbbVie, for the purpose of allowing us to conduct certain development and commercialization activities in the United States relating to protease inhibitors. AbbVie is responsible for and has funded all costs associated with the development, manufacturing and commercialization of paritaprevir, glecaprevir and any other compounds under this agreement. Under the agreement, we are eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties with respect to these compounds. So long as a product candidate is being developed or commercialized under the agreement, we undertake not to conduct any activity, or grant licenses to a third party, relating to protease inhibitors.
A joint steering committee was established under the agreement with review and oversight responsibilities for all research, development and commercialization activities. The joint steering committee is comprised of three of our senior personnel and three senior personnel from AbbVie; however, AbbVie has final authority to make all decisions regarding development and commercialization activities.
The research program and the evaluation period, which was performed by both parties, ended in June 2011. The first commercialized compound was paritaprevir with the second commercialized compound, glecaprevir, approved in 2017 and marketed under the tradenames MAVYRET® (U.S.) or MAVIRET (ex-U.S.). Under this collaboration we have received $396 million in payments from AbbVie for license payments, proceeds from a sale of preferred stock, research funding payments and milestone payments.
We also receive annually tiered, double-digit royalties per protease inhibitor product developed under the agreement, which range from ten percent up to twenty percent, or on a blended basis from the low double digits up to the high teens. However, if a product is determined to be a combination product, as is the case for both glecaprevir and paritaprevir, the net sales of the combination product are adjusted on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis to reflect a good faith determination of the relative value of each pharmaceutically active ingredient, based on the estimated fair market value. This means that a portion of AbbVie’s worldwide annual net sales of a combination product or regimen is first allocated to one of our protease inhibitors and then that royalty-bearing portion is multiplied by the annually tiered royalty rates to determine our actual royalty for the protease product in that regimen in a given period. Under the terms of our agreement, as amended in October 2014, 50% of AbbVie’s net sales of MAVYRET/MAVIRET are

allocated to glecaprevir. Beginning with each January 1, the cumulative net sales of a given royalty-bearing protease inhibitor product start at zero for purposes of calculating the tiered royalties on a product-by-product basis. Under this collaboration, we have received royalty payments from AbbVie totaling $812 million through September 30, 2022. Further details of these tiered royalties are set forth in Note 7 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report, which are incorporated herein by this reference.
Royalties owed to us under the agreement can be reduced by AbbVie in certain circumstances, including (i) if AbbVie exercises its right to license or otherwise acquire rights to intellectual property controlled by a third party where a product could not be legally developed or commercialized in a country without the third-party intellectual property right, (ii) where a product developed under the collaboration agreement is sold in a country and not covered by a valid patent claim in such country, or (iii) where sales of a generic product are equal to at least a specified percentage of AbbVie’s market share of a product in a country.
AbbVie’s obligation to pay royalties on products developed under the agreement expires on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the later of (i) the date of expiration of the last of the licensed patents with a valid claim covering the product in the applicable country, and (ii) ten years after the first commercial sale of the product in the applicable country.
Our intellectual property existing as of the effective date of the agreement remains our property. Any intellectual property jointly developed is jointly owned. We will have the unilateral right to enforce our patent rights on any covered product following the first commercial sale of such product, as will AbbVie. In the event of infringement related to any of our patents, we will have the first right and option to initiate legal proceedings or take other actions. In the event of infringement related to any AbbVie patents, AbbVie will have the first right and option to initiate legal proceedings or take other actions. In the event of infringement of a joint patent right, we will discuss with AbbVie whether to initiate legal proceedings or take other actions. AbbVie will have the obligation to defend at its sole expense any actions brought against either party alleging infringement of third-party rights by reason of the activities conducted under the agreement and we will have the right to obtain separate counsel at our own expense. Additionally, AbbVie, at its sole expense, will be responsible for all trademark prosecution.
Subject to the exceptions described above, a party’s rights and obligations under the agreement continue until: (i) such time as AbbVie is no longer developing a product candidate or (ii) if, as of the time AbbVie is no longer developing any product candidates, AbbVie is commercializing any other protease inhibitor product, such time as all royalty terms for all covered products and all co-development terms for all co-developed products have ended. Accordingly, the final expiration date of the agreement is currently indeterminable.
Either party may terminate the agreement for cause in the event of a material breach, subject to prior notice and the opportunity to cure, or in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy. Additionally, AbbVie may terminate the agreement for any reason upon specified prior notice.
If we terminate the agreement for cause or AbbVie terminates without cause, any licenses and other rights granted to AbbVie will terminate and AbbVie will be deemed to have granted us (i) a non-exclusive, perpetual, fully paid, worldwide, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, under AbbVie’s intellectual property used in any product candidate and (ii) an exclusive (even as to AbbVie), perpetual, fully paid, worldwide, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, under AbbVie’s interest in joint intellectual property rights to develop product candidates resulting from covered compounds and to commercialize any products derived from such compounds. Upon our request, AbbVie will also transfer to us all right, title and interest in any related product trademarks, regulatory filings and clinical trials.
If AbbVie terminates the agreement for our uncured breach, the royalty payments payable by AbbVie may be reduced, the licenses granted to AbbVie will remain in place, we will be deemed to have granted AbbVie an exclusive license under our interest in joint intellectual property, AbbVie will continue to have the right to commercialize any covered products, and all rights and licenses granted to us by AbbVie will terminate.
Drug Discovery
We have internally discovered all of the compounds in our research and development programs. Our scientists have expertise in the areas of medicinal chemistry, molecular virology, pharmacology, and toxicology with highly developed sets of skills in compound generation, target selection, screening and pharmacology, preclinical development and lead optimization. We are utilizing these skills and capabilities in our discovery and development of virology and liver disease product candidates.
We focus on virology and other disease indications representing large and growing market opportunities with significant unmet medical needs. Our selection of a particular therapeutic target within those disease indications takes into consideration the experience and expertise of our scientific team and includes our ability to generate robust medicinal chemistry structure-activity relationships to assist lead optimization and secure relevant intellectual property rights. Once we have identified lead compounds, they are tested using in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies and in vivo research models of antiviral or antibacterial efficacy.
Business Development
 We also regularly examine opportunities to in-license compounds and technologies to complement our existing internal discovery programs. In addition, we engage from time to time in discussions with third parties to out-license intellectual property that no longer fits in our strategic priorities for our internal research and development programs.
Competition
 We are engaged in segments of the pharmaceutical industry that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are commercializing or pursuing the development of products that target HCV, RSV, SARS-CoV-2, HBV, hMPV and other viral infections or other diseases that we may target in the future.
Many of our competitors have substantially greater commercial infrastructures and financial, technical and personnel resources than we have, as well as drug candidates in late-stage clinical development. We will not be able to compete successfully unless we are able to:
•design and develop products that are superior to other products in the market; 
 •attract qualified scientific, medical, regulatory, sales and marketing and commercial personnel; 
 •obtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our processes and product candidates; 
 •obtain required regulatory approvals; or
 •collaborate with others in the development and commercialization of new products. 
 Established competitors may invest heavily to quickly discover and develop novel compounds that could make our product candidates obsolete. In addition, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety, or some combination of these factors, to overcome competition and to be commercially successful.
We expect AbbVie’s MAVYRET/MAVIRET to continue to face intense competition due to existing approved products in the HCV market. AbbVie’s MAVYRET/MAVIRET regimen currently faces competition in various world markets and subpopulations of HCV from Gilead’s Epclusa® (a fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir), Vosevi® (a triple combination therapy of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir approved by the FDA for specified sofosbuvir -treatment failures and NS5A-inhibitor treatment failures) and Harvoni® (a fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir); and to a lesser extent - Merck’s Zepatier® (a fixed-dose combination of grazoprevir and elbasvir). Gilead launched authorized generic versions of Epclusa and Harvoni through its subsidiary, Asegua Therapeutics, LLC, which have had an impact on the competitive landscape. For example, the state of Louisiana selected Asegua as their HCV subscription model pharmaceutical partner to provide the state with unrestricted access to its direct-acting antiviral medication.
Other competitive products in the form of other treatment methods or a vaccine for HCV may render MAVYRET/MAVIRET obsolete or noncompetitive. MAVYRET/MAVIRET will face competition based on its safety and effectiveness, reimbursement coverage, price, patent position, AbbVie’s marketing and sales capabilities, and other factors. If MAVYRET/MAVIRET faces competition from generic products other than authorized generic versions by the manufacturer of the branded product (i.e. Gilead and Asegua Therapeutics), our collaboration agreement provides that the royalty rate applicable to our protease product contained in the regimen is reduced significantly by a specified percentage on a product-by-product, country-by-country basis. If AbbVie is not able to compete effectively against its competitors in HCV, our business will not grow and our financial condition, operations and stock price will suffer.
Similarly, RSV, COVID-19 and HBV represent competitive therapeutic areas. For RSV, there are currently no safe and effective therapies for already established RSV infection. Several companies are seeking to develop new antiviral treatments for RSV infection in adult and pediatric patients. Ark Biosciences, Pfizer/ReViral (acquired in June 2022) and Merck all have compounds in clinical development. Synagis, a prophylactic, monoclonal-antibody-based treatment from AstraZeneca, which is commercialized by AbbVie outside the U.S., is approved for infants considered at high risk for RSV infection; however, studies have found that most young children with RSV infection were previously healthy, and thus would not normally be prescribed prophylactic treatment. AstraZeneca/Sanofi and Merck are developing long-acting versions of the monoclonal antibody for prophylaxis use in infants. In addition, a number of companies have RSV vaccines in development, primarily directed at prevention of RSV infection, and some companies are also evaluating vaccines in a therapeutic mode for treatment of established RSV infection.
 Currently, there are two Emergency Use Authorizations of oral antiviral treatments for non-hospitalized, high-risk patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: Paxlovid, a 3CL protease inhibitor, and Molnupiravir, a polymerase inhibitor. Additionally, there are companies developing oral direct acting antivirals for SARS-CoV-2 that are currently in Phase 2 or 3 studies including Shionogi, Toyama, Atea, Pardes, SyneuRx and Todos as well as additional compounds in Phase 1 studies.

While there are antiviral medications prescribed for HBV that can suppress HBV DNA, they generally have low cure rates, resulting in the need for lifelong treatment. Many companies are seeking to develop new HBV drugs, including GIGB, Gilead, Green Cross, GSK/Ionis, HEC Pharma, Johnson & Johnson/Janssen, Qilu, Replicor, Roche, Vaccitech, VBI Vaccines and Vir Biotechnology, which have Phase 2 programs in progress, with many of these companies conducting earlier stage programs as well. In addition, a number of companies have Phase 1 or earlier stage HBV programs.
 If we are not able to develop new products that can compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition, operations and stock price will suffer.
 Intellectual Property
As part of our business strategy, we actively seek patent protection for our product candidates in the United States and certain major foreign jurisdictions and file additional patent applications, when appropriate, to cover improvements to our compounds. We also rely on trade secrets, internal know-how, technological innovations and agreements with third parties to develop, maintain and protect our competitive position. Our ability to be competitive will depend on the success of this strategy.
Each of our major research and development programs, including RSV, SARS-CoV-2, HBV and hMPV, as well as our out-licensed products for HCV and our FXR agonist assets, typically has several pending patent claims and issued patents in the program area containing claims to compounds, methods of use and processes for synthesis. However, only a few of the issued patents and/or pending patent applications cover the lead product candidate in a given program.
RSV, SARS-CoV-2, HBV. Our patent portfolio directed to N-and L-protein inhibitors for RSV, protease inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 and core inhibitors for HBV, includes issued U.S. patents or pending U.S. patent applications, or both, as well as numerous foreign patent applications. We expect that our existing patents and patent applications (assuming patents are ultimately issued), will provide patent coverage in the U.S., if and when a compound is approved by the FDA, until at least 2038 for each of our compounds currently in clinical development.
HCV NS3 Protease Inhibitor Program. The patent portfolio directed to the HCV protease inhibitor program with AbbVie includes U.S. patents and foreign patents, as well as non-provisional applications. The issued U.S. composition-of-matter patent covering paritaprevir is expected to expire in 2031. The issued U.S. composition-of-matter patent covering glecaprevir is expected to expire in 2032. AbbVie is a joint owner of a number of the non-provisional patent applications. AbbVie also has rights to some or all of these patents and patent applications pursuant to its collaboration agreement with us.
 We may obtain patents for certain compounds many years before we obtain marketing approval for products containing such compounds. Because patents have a limited life, which usually begins to run well before the first commercial sale of the related product, the commercial value of the patent may be limited. However, we may be able to apply for patent term extensions in the United States and in a number of European countries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval, but we cannot be certain we will obtain such extensions.
It is also very important that we do not infringe patents or other proprietary rights of others. If we do infringe such patents or other proprietary rights, we could be prevented from developing or selling products or from using the processes covered by those patents, could be required to pay substantial damages, or could be required to obtain a license from the third party to allow us to use their technology, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we were not able to obtain a required license or develop alternative technologies, we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products, and our business could be adversely affected.
In addition, we jointly own patent applications, together with AbbVie, that claim paritaprevir and glecaprevir as a chemical entity. However, there is no guarantee that such applications will issue. Further, the existence of issued patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have already or could obtain rights to patents that could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates. If these other parties are successful in obtaining valid and enforceable patents, and establishing our infringement of those patents, we could be prevented from commercializing our product candidates unless we were able to obtain a license under such patents, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
Much of our scientific capabilities depend upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key scientific and technical personnel. To protect our rights to our proprietary know-how and technology, we endeavor to require all employees, as well as our consultants and advisors, when feasible, to enter into confidentiality agreements that require disclosure and assignment to us of ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by these employees, consultants and advisors in the course of their service to us.
We may be unable to obtain, maintain and protect the intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business, and we may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, which could materially harm our business. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property Rights.”
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we develop. Any pharmaceutical candidate that we develop must be approved by the FDA before it may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before it may be legally marketed in foreign countries.
United States Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practice, or GLPs, or other applicable regulations; 
 •Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s current Good Clinical Practice, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
 •Submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or an NDA, for a new drug product; 
 •Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is to be produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice standards, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •Potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA. 
 The lengthy process of seeking required approvals, which can often take anywhere from six months from the time the NDA is filed if there is a priority review for a breakthrough therapy to at least twelve months for a standard review, and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources. There can be no certainty that approvals will be granted.
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with GLP and other federal regulations and requirements. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot assure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that result in suspension or termination of such trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients having the disease being studied under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.

The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed.
Human clinical trials prior to approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy humans and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted only in patients having the specific disease. 
 •Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule for patients having the specific disease. 
 •Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials, which usually involve more patients than earlier trials, are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. 
 Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as part of the approval process.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA by the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human patients. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board, may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must include methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees by the applicant; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers.
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has twelve months in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority NDA. The review clock for an NDA may be extended if a major amendment is submitted during the review cycle. In addition, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs.
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. In addition to its own review, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be

approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is to be manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information.
The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA will issue a “complete response” letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has four programs intended to expedite the development and review of new drugs addressing unmet medical needs or treating serious or life-threatening conditions: fast track, breakthrough therapy, priority review, and accelerated approval, in addition to emergency use authorization, or EUA, in situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
The FDA “fast track” program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and address unmet medical needs. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Under the fast track program, the sponsor will have more frequent interactions with the FDA during drug development, and may also submit sections of the NDA on a rolling basis to the FDA for review before submitting the complete application. Fast track does not guarantee that a product will be reviewed more quickly or receive FDA approval.
The FDA “breakthrough therapy” program is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. Preliminary clinical evidence must show that the drug may have substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Although the drug does not have to address an unmet medical need, designation of breakthrough therapy status carries all the “fast track” program features. Additionally, the breakthrough therapy program entitles the sponsor to earlier and more frequent interaction with the FDA review team regarding development of nonclinical and clinical data, and allows the FDA to offer product development and regulatory advice necessary to shorten the time for product approval. The breakthrough therapy status does not guarantee a quicker development or review of the product, and does not ensure FDA approval.
The FDA also has a “priority review” program for products offering significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. The goal of the priority review program is to shorten the review period to six months from the twelve months required for standard review. Any drug with breakthrough therapy, accelerated approval designation, or fast track can be granted priority review if it meets the necessary criteria.
The FDA “accelerated approval” program is intended to expedite the development and review of products with the potential to treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. The program allows approval of a product on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of the product perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to establish safety and efficacy for the approved indication. Failure to conduct such studies or failure of the studies to establish required safety and efficacy may result in revocation of approval. The FDA also requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch or subsequent marketing of the product.

The FDA may also allow the use of unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of approved medical products, under an emergency use authorization, or EUA, to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have been met, including that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. An EUA is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures during public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Once submitted, the FDA will evaluate an EUA request and determine whether the relevant statutory criteria are met, taking into account the totality of the scientific evidence about the drug that is available to FDA. EUAs can be terminated, revoked or reissued, depending on the state of the public health emergency and new data about the drug.
 Post-Approval Requirements
Any drug products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA. Certain requirements include, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information on an annual basis or more frequently for specific events, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. These promotion and advertising requirements include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions against promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), rules for conducting industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including the immediate discontinuation of noncomplying materials, adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Manufacturers of our product candidates are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. These regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of comprehensive records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are also required to register their establishments and list any products they make with the FDA and to comply with related requirements in certain states. These entities are further subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in serious and extensive restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA. These restrictions may include suspension of a product until the FDA is assured that quality standards can be met, continuing oversight of manufacturing by the FDA under a “consent decree,” which frequently includes the imposition of costs and continuing inspections over a period of many years, as well as possible withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, as well as risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could otherwise restrict the distribution or use of the product.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during federal regulatory review preceding the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted within 60 days of approval, prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. However, there is no guarantee that any such application will be approved.
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA, which are independent of patent status and any patent related extensions, can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA. If the new drug is a new chemical entity subject to an NDA, the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or functional group of a molecule responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a so-called Section 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, state attorney generals and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Under the Veterans Health Care Act, or VHCA, drug companies are required to offer certain pharmaceutical products at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and United States Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service—designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs including Medicare and Medicaid. Recent legislative changes purport to require that discounted prices be offered for certain United States Department of Defense purchases for its TRICARE program via a rebate system. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to

each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trials may proceed.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) / WHO Good Clinical Practice standards and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA. The application used to file an NDA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCPs and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
In 2003, the United States government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through private prescription drug plans that contract with the federal government and adhere to certain minimum requirements.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry.
The comprehensive overhaul extended coverage to approximately 20 million previously uninsured Americans. Since its adoption, the ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse, which have affected existing government healthcare programs and have resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment tied to performance. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act:
•increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand-name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; 
 •required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; 
 •required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D, beginning January 2011; and 
 •imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs. 
 Several states have not implemented the provisions of the ACA that involve the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to low-income adults. While the United States Supreme Court recently rejected the latest challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA, it is possible

that other legislative efforts may seek to modify it. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed since the Affordable Care Act was enacted.
There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, introduces some of the most significant changes to Medicare payment for prescription drugs since the ACA. Among its many provisions, the IRA authorizes the Medicare program to negotiate pricing for certain high-cost drugs, including physician-administered and self-administered drugs, that have been on the market for a minimum amount of time without generic competition. Each year, beginning with calendar year 2026, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services will implement a negotiated price, known as the “Maximum Fair Price”, or MFP, that will be made public and apply to the drug’s Medicare utilization if the drug is among the top 10 drugs with the highest Medicare spending. Manufacturers who fail to offer the MFP, or fail to come to the table to negotiate after the Secretary has determined their drug is eligible for negotiation, will incur an excise tax of up to 95% for each sale of the drug in the United States. Depending on the share of Medicare spending each year that is attributed to MAVYRET or any other drug we may develop or out-license, and whether or not those drugs become eligible for Medicare negotiation, those drugs and our revenue may be adversely impacted by this provision.
 The IRA also will require manufacturers, beginning in 2023, to rebate the Medicare program for Medicare utilization of drugs that have price increases faster than the rate of inflation. The benchmark to which price increases are compared will vary depending on the drug. Although manufacturers are generally familiar with inflation rebates under the Medicaid program, where they have existed for decades, the IRA represents the first time that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, has extended inflation rebates to the Medicare program.
 The IRA also redesigns the Medicare prescription drug benefit in several important ways, beginning in calendar year 2025. First, the IRA places an annual out-of-pocket cap on Medicare beneficiary cost sharing amounts, which will actually take effect in calendar year 2024 before the full benefit redesign. Previously, beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket costs were uncapped, even if heavily subsidized. Second, the IRA requires that manufacturers share in the cost of prescription drugs throughout the prescription drug benefit. Previously manufacturers only needed to offer discounted pricing for a single phase of the prescription drug benefit. Finally, the IRA shifts the majority of liability in the “catastrophic phase”—the phase of the prescription drug benefit that only the costliest of Medicare beneficiaries enter—to the private Part D plans, thereby encouraging them to better manage costs. Previously, the Federal government incurred the vast majority of liability during the catastrophic phase. Together, these changes to the Medicare prescription drug benefit will create new pricing dynamics for payers and manufacturers.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any drug candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical drug pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Research and Development
 Our research and development expenses were $164.5 million, $174.1 million and $136.8 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
 Manufacturing
We do not have our own manufacturing capabilities, except with respect to limited amounts of active pharmaceutical ingredients needed for preclinical development. To date, we have relied on third-party manufacturers, including manufacturers in China, for supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients and ingredients for use in clinical trials of our product candidates. We also expect that in the future we will rely on such manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of any product candidates that we commercialize ourselves. Manufacturing for glecaprevir is conducted by AbbVie. Wherever possible, we seek to identify multiple suppliers for raw materials and key intermediaries to be used in our manufacturing process.
Sales and Marketing
We currently do not have any commercialization or sales and marketing capabilities, and currently have no fixed plans to invest in or build such capabilities internally. We have partnered our protease inhibitor compounds for HCV with AbbVie. We may also partner or collaborate with, or license commercial rights to, other larger pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies to support the development of one or more of our wholly-owned product candidates through late-stage clinical development and, if successful, commercialization. However, we still retain all commercial rights to our independent programs and we will continue to evaluate our alternatives for commercializing them once they are more advanced in their clinical development.

Human Capital Resources
 As of September 30, 2022, we had 160 full-time employees, 74 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees and an additional 40 of whom hold a master's degree or other post-graduate degree. We consider the intellectual capital of our employees to be an essential driver of our business and key to our future prospects. Historically we have had relatively low turnover of employees, but as our headcount has grown in the past three years and the number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in the Boston area has increased dramatically, we have experienced an increase in the number of employees leaving for other opportunities. Given our financial resources and our track record, we continue to be able to fill the vacated positions and grow our headcount in support of our expanding pipeline of research programs and product candidates. We also monitor our compensation programs closely and provide what we consider to be a very competitive mix of compensation and insurance benefits for all our employees, as well as participation in our equity programs. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
