On March 26, 2018, we completed a pro rata distribution of the common stock of our subsidiary, Rafael Holdings, Inc., or Rafael, to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 13, 2018, which we refer to as the Rafael Spin-Off. The disposition of Rafael did not meet the criteria to be reported as a discontinued operation and accordingly, Rafael’s assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows have not been reclassified. In connection with the Rafael Spin-Off, each of the Company’s stockholders received one share of Rafael Class A common stock for every two shares of the Company’s Class A common stock and one share of Rafael Class B common stock for every two shares of the Company’s Class B common stock, held of record as of the close of business on March 13, 2018. At the time of the Rafael Spin-Off, Rafael owned the commercial real estate assets and interests in two clinical stage pharmaceutical companies that we previously held. The commercial real estate holdings consisted of our headquarters building and its associated public garage in Newark, New Jersey, an office/data center building in Piscataway, New Jersey and a portion of a building in Israel that hosts offices for us and certain affiliates. The pharmaceutical holdings included debt interests and warrants in Rafael Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Rafael Pharma (formerly Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), which is a clinical stage, oncology-focused pharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of therapies that exploit the metabolic differences between normal cells and cancer cells, and a majority equity interest in Lipomedix Pharmaceuticals Ltd, or Lipomedix, a pharmaceutical development company based in Israel. In addition, prior to the Rafael Spin-Off, we transferred assets to Rafael such that, at the time of the Rafael Spin-Off, Rafael had $42.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, plus approximately $6 million in hedge fund and other investments.

OUR STRATEGY
 
Since our founding, we have focused on value creation by leveraging potentially disruptive telecommunications, payment and other technologies to challenge entrenched business models. Outside of our core businesses, we sought to select and incubate promising early stage businesses and, in several cases, have sold those businesses or spun them off to our stockholders.
 
Since 2008, we have spun off certain non-core businesses and assets to our stockholders, including CTM Media (now IDW Media Holdings) (2009), Genie Energy (2011), Straight Path Communications (2013), Zedge (2016) and Rafael (2018). In addition, in October 2014, we completed the sale of our interest in Fabrix, a network storage and processing technology business, to Ericsson for $69 million in cash as part of Ericsson’s purchase of Fabrix for $95 million.
 
Our revenues and income from operations are generated predominantly by three core offerings:
 

§ | Boss Revolution prepaid PIN-less calling service including both domestic and international sales;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | wholesale carrier services to terminate international long distance calls around the world for Tier 1 fixed line and mobile network operators, as well as other service providers; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | domestic and international mobile top-up offerings (DMTU and IMTU, respectively) and money remittance services sold through our retail network or directly from the Boss Revolution online/mobile platform and Boss Revolution Money app and our National Retail Solutions business.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our legacy core services compete primarily in the mature pay-per-minute international voice communications market. Several industry-wide trends are reducing the size of the global market including the growing popularity of low-cost or free messaging services and other non-voice communications technologies, free over-the-top communications which can be utilized when both parties have access to broadband connections, and the prevalence of flat-rate international long distance plans offered both by the largest mobile network operators and niche mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs.
 
To counter the sectoral challenges in the pay-per-minute market of our core offerings, we have embarked on a multi-pronged strategy:
 

§ | Diversification and enhancement of offerings in the core market:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


§ | developing new and competitive core offerings such as unlimited, flat monthly rate calling plans within the Boss Revolution brand;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | diversifying our IMTU offerings by bundling voice, data and messaging;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | offering incumbent national telecom’s value added services including outsourced management of international long-distance traffic; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | launching the Boss Revolution and Boss Revolution Money Apps, to deepen our direct-to-consumer relationships
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Investing significantly in new offerings and technologies:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


§ | Development, launch and subsequent improvements to the Boss Revolution and Boss Revolution money apps, both of which significantly strengthen our relationships with our retail customers
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Development of net2phone’s unified communications platform
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


§ | New technologies that significantly reduce the cost of connectivity
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Opening new markets for certain of our offerings, for example in Cuba and South America.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
 
We have two reportable business segments, Telecom & Payment Services (formerly known as Telecom Platform Services) and net2phone-Unified Communications as a Service, or net2phone-UCaaS (formerly known as UCaaS).
 
Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, our Telecom & Payment Services segment includes Consumer Phone Services, which was previously reported as a separate segment. Consumer Phone Services provides consumer local and long distance services in certain U.S. states. Comparative results have been reclassified and restated as if Consumer Phone Services was included in Telecom & Payment Services in all referenced periods.
Telecom and Payment Services
 
Our Telecom & Payment Services, or TPS, segment, which represented 97.7% and 97.9% of our total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively, markets and distributes multiple communications and payment services across three business verticals:

§ | Retail Communications provides international long-distance calling products primarily to foreign-born communities, with its core markets in the United States;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Wholesale Carrier Services is a global telecom carrier, terminating international long distance calls around the world for Tier 1 fixed line and mobile network operators, as well as other service providers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Payment Services provides payment offerings, including international and domestic airtime top-up, domestic bill payment and international money transfer services, and our merchant service offerings through POS terminals.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
During fiscal 2018, our TPS segment generated $1,511.5 million in revenues worldwide and income from operations of $25.8 million, as compared with revenues of $1,470.0 million in revenues worldwide and income from operations of $25.5 million in fiscal 2017.

Retail Communications
 
Retail Communications’ revenue was $582.3 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $615.6 million in fiscal 2017 (38.5% and 41.9% of TPS’ revenue in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively).
 
Most of Retail Communications’ sales are generated by the Boss Revolution PIN-less international calling service. Other smaller lines of business contribute to Retail Communications sales, including (1) traditional, disposable prepaid calling cards sold under a variety of brand names both domestically and overseas, (2) private label and IDT branded prepaid and point of sale activated calling cards sold to large retailers, medium sized retail chains (e.g. supermarkets, drug stores), and smaller grocery stores and similar outlets, (3) our PennyTalk international calling service, and (4) consumer phone services, which provides bundled local/long distance residential phone service in 11 states under the brand name IDT America. Other revenues generated using our Boss Revolution platform, including airtime top-up and international money transfer, are reflected in the Payment Services vertical discussed below.
 
Boss Revolution PIN-less allows users to call their families and friends overseas without the need to enter a personal identification number, or PIN. To place a call, a customer must first establish a Boss Revolution prepaid account. Boss Revolution customers can access our network by dialing a local access or toll-free number. Our platform recognizes the user’s network-provided automatic number identification (ANI) and seamlessly links each call to the corresponding Boss Revolution account. Callers then enter their destination phone numbers. The dialing process is automated to provide one-touch dialing in the Boss Revolution Calling app.
 
Boss Revolution customers’ account balances are typically debited at a fixed rate per minute. In contrast to many competitors, Boss Revolution does not charge connection, usage or breakage fees. Boss Revolution per minute rates can vary by the destination country, city, and whether the call is a landline or mobile phone. Rates are published on the Boss Revolution consumer website and within the Boss Revolution Calling app. In addition to per minute prepaid plans, Boss Revolution offers unlimited calling plans and bucket-of-minute plans for a flat fee to some destinations.
 
Customers can add to, or top-up, their account balance at any Boss Revolution retailer using cash, a debit card or a credit card. Customers with a credit card, debit card or store-bought top-up voucher can also add to their account balance directly by phone, online through the Boss Revolution consumer web site (www.bossrevolution.com), or through the Boss Revolution Calling or Money apps.
 
In the United States, we distribute many of our retail products through our network of distributors that, either directly or through sub-distributors, sells to retail locations. In addition, our internal sales force sells Boss Revolution platform products directly to retailers. Also, the Boss Revolution Calling app is available for download through both the iTunes and Google Play stores. Distributors, our internal sales people and retailers typically receive commissions based on the revenue generated by each transaction.
 
In 2017, we introduced an update of the Boss Revolution retailer portal that can be accessed via the web browser on a mobile device to enable any qualified individual in the United States with an Android or iOS smartphone to become a Boss Revolution retailer and to manage their Boss Revolution account virtually anywhere, anytime. The Boss Revolution retailer portal enables retailers to create accounts for new customers, add funds to existing customer balances and execute sales transactions for the various products and services available on the portal. The Boss Revolution retailer portal also provides a direct, real-time interface with our retailers, resulting in a cost-effective and adaptable distribution model that can rapidly respond to changes in the business environment.
 
The Boss Revolution platform allows us to target and promote services directly to distributors, retailers and customers and to introduce and cross-sell offerings. In 2017, we introduced the BOSS Revolution Money app, which works seamlessly with the Boss Revolution Calling app to let customers send money transfers, mobile airtime top-up and electronic gift cards to family and friends easily and securely.
 
In the United States, the Boss Revolution brand is supported by national, regional and local marketing programs that include television and radio advertising, online advertising, print media, and grass roots marketing at community and sporting events. In addition, we work closely with distributors and retailers on in-store promotional programs and events.
 
Retail Communications’ sales have traditionally been strongest in the Northeastern United States and in Florida because of our extensive local distribution network and their large foreign-born populations. We continue to grow distributor relationships and expand our retail network in other areas of the United States, including the Southwest and West Coast, where we historically have not had as strong of a market presence.
 
We launched Boss Revolution Mobile in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Boss Revolution Mobile is a domestic mobile service operating on Sprint’s nationwide network offering an innovative, low-cost model for mobile service under our Boss Revolution brand.

Wholesale Carrier Services
 
Wholesale Carrier Services’ revenue was $645.5 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $609.0 million in fiscal 2017 (42.7% and 41.4% of TPS’ revenue in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively).
 
Wholesale Carrier Services terminates international telecommunications traffic in more than 190 countries around the world. The division’s customers include our Retail Communications business, net2phone, major and niche carriers around the globe, mobile network operators, and other service providers such as call aggregators. For many of these customers, particularly the major carriers, we engage in buy-sell relationships, terminating their customers’ traffic in exchange for terminating our wholesale and retail traffic with them.
 
We offer competitively priced international termination rates at several quality levels. We can offer competitively priced termination services in part because of the large volumes of originating minutes generated by our Retail Communications business, our global platform powered by proprietary software, our team of professional and experienced account managers and market makers, and an extensive network of interconnects around the globe.
 
TPS terminated 25.5 billion minutes in fiscal 2018, as compared to 26.6 billion minutes in fiscal 2017, making us one of the largest carriers of international long-distance minutes worldwide. Wholesale Carrier Services accounted for 20.0 billion minutes and 19.9 billion minutes of the total TPS’ minutes in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.
 
Wholesale Carrier Services has a significant number of direct connections to Tier 1 providers in North America, Latin America, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Tier 1 providers are the largest recognized licensed carriers in a country. Direct connections improve the quality of the telephone calls and reduce the cost, thereby enabling us to generate more traffic with higher margins to the associated foreign locales. We also have direct relationships with mobile network operators, reflecting their growing share of the voice traffic market.
 
Termination rates charged by Tier 1 and other providers of international long-distance traffic have been declining for many years. Nevertheless, termination rates charged to us by individual Tier 1 carriers and mobile operators can be volatile. Termination price volatility on heavily trafficked routes can significantly impact our minutes of use and wholesale revenues.
 
In addition to offering competitive rates to our carrier customers, we emphasize our ability to offer the high-quality connections that these providers often require. To that end, we offer higher-priced services in which we provide higher-quality connections, based upon a set of predetermined quality of service criteria. These services meet a growing need for higher-quality connections for some of our customers who provide services to high-value, quality-conscious retail customers. As of July 31, 2018, Wholesale Carrier Services had more than 2,000 customers and has over 400 carrier relationships globally.
 
Wholesale Carrier Services’ revenue is generated by sales to both postpaid and prepaid customers. Postpaid customers typically include Tier 1 carriers, mobile network operators and our most credit worthy customers. Prepaid customers are typically smaller telecommunication companies as well as independent call aggregators.
 
In fiscal 2017, we announced an outsourcing initiative, Voicehub, to help fixed and mobile telephony operators enhance the profitability and value of their international voice operations. Wholesale Carrier Services offers these operators customized solutions including full outsourcing, handing all inbound and outbound calls with or without switch management, and hybrid arrangements whereby the operator retains certain routes or customers directly.
 
Payment Services
 
Payment Services’ revenue was $283.7 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $245.3 million in fiscal 2017 (18.8% and 16.7% of TPS’ revenue in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively).
 
Most of Payment Services’ revenue is generated by the sale of IMTU offerings. Other products and services in this vertical include DMTU, gift cards sold in the United States and Europe, domestic bill payment service, our international money transfer service, our POS terminals and related offerings and, until its expected sale in fiscal 2019, the operations of our Gibraltar-based bank. Payment Services’ offerings leverage our platform capabilities, our distribution reach into foreign-born communities and our global reach to provide convenient and affordable offerings primarily over the Boss Revolution platform.
 
6

 

Our IMTU products enable customers to purchase airtime and bundles of airtime, messaging and data for a prepaid mobile telephone in another country. They are sold both over our Boss Revolution platform and in hard card format. Our IMTU are focused on geographic corridors, such as the United States to various Central American countries, that tend to generate high volumes of business, and are part of a comprehensive product offering that includes product, marketing and distribution focused on those corridors.
 
International remittances are a significant economic activity among our target market of foreign-born residents and other under-banked communities. Our international money transfer service is offered over the Boss Revolution platform, and like other payment services, utilizes our retail network and associated ability to serve unbanked customers. However, only a limited number of Boss Revolution retailers in the United States qualify to process international money transfer transactions.
 
Revenues from international money transfer are derived from a per-transaction fee charged to the customer and from foreign exchange differentials. Transaction costs include commissions paid to the retail agent, payment to the international disbursing agent, banking, compliance, and foreign currency exchange costs.
 
Through our Domestic Bill Payment service, consumers can pay their regular bills with cash at a Boss Revolution agent location. We offer consumers expedited and standard (next day) payment service options to over 10,000 billers in key segments, including utilities, credit card companies, mortgage loan and auto finance companies. Revenues from Bill Pay services are derived primarily from fees charged to consumers for each transaction.
 
Our merchant services business, National Retail Solutions, or NRS, was founded in fiscal 2016 to build and operate a network of point-of-sale (POS) terminals. NRS leverages its network to provide services to bodegas and other independent retailers as well as retail industry suppliers and service providers.  NRS designed the POS terminals to offer versatile functionality. The terminals include barcode scanners, customer and retailer facing hi-definition screens, and credit card readers.  At September 30, 2018, NRS had deployed more than 5,600 POS terminals with bodegas and other retailers nationwide, and expects to deploy approximately 1,000 additional terminals per quarter.
 
NRS derives revenue from the sale of the POS terminals to retailers, a monthly recurring fee for use of the terminals, and additional terminal-based marketing, advertising and payment services sold a la carte. These include data analytics, credit card processing and display advertising. 
 
The NRS merchant services business is synergistic with other BOSS Revolution communications and payment services including PIN-less calling, international money transfer, and sales of IMTU products, all of which can be sold and provisioned by retailers directly from their NRS terminals.
 
Payment Services also includes reloadable prepaid debit cards marketed across the European Economic Area and Bank Identification Number (BIN) sponsorship services offered by our Gibraltar-based bank, which we expect to sell in fiscal 2019.
 
International Operations
 
Internationally, we are a provider of prepaid calling cards including both private label and IDT-branded calling cards, which are sold through an extensive network of thousands of independent retailers as well as through our own internal sales force. Additionally, we sell Boss Revolution PIN-less international calling, IMTU, DMTU and payment services in select global markets both through retailers and directly to consumers. Wholesale Termination and related wholesale services are marketed and sold globally through our internal Carrier Services account management team.
 
In Europe, we market our Retail Communications products in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and Austria, seeking to capitalize on the demographic opportunity presented by immigration from outside of Europe to these developed nations. Because the immigrant market is fragmented, and due to the large number of markets in which we compete, we offer over 600 different prepaid calling cards in Europe. In addition, we sell Boss Revolution platform products through retailers, our mobile calling app, and direct-to-consumer web sites in Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, we sell the Prime Card, a leading prepaid MasterCard through select retailers and online directly to consumers.
 
Our operations in Europe also include Wholesale Carrier Services. We maintain our European corporate, Retail Communications and Wholesale Carrier Services operations in London, England. We also operate satellite offices in Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland and Greece.

Our European operations, including Wholesale Carrier Services and Retail Communications, generated $428.8 million of revenues in fiscal 2018, a 4.9% increase from the $408.9 million of revenues generated during fiscal 2017. Our European operations’ revenues constituted 27.7% of IDT Telecom’s revenues in fiscal 2018, as compared to 27.3% in fiscal 2017.
 
In Asia we sell Boss Revolution direct to consumers online and through our app in Australia and post-paid services direct to consumers and small businesses in Hong Kong and Singapore. In fiscal 2018, we generated $55.5 million in revenues from our operations in the Asia-Pacific region compared to $43.7 million in fiscal 2017, primarily through our Wholesale Carrier Services. We maintain our Asia Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong.
 
In Latin America, we market Retail Communications products in Argentina and Brazil. In addition, we offer SIP trunking VoIP services in Brazil to large enterprise businesses. In fiscal 2017, net2phone began offering its hosted PBX services in Brazil and Argentina. We maintain our Latin American headquarters in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Sao Paulo, Brazil. In fiscal 2018, IDT Telecom generated $9.7 million in revenues from the sale of Retail Communications and net2phone-UCaaS products in Latin America compared to $10.5 million in fiscal 2017.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
In the United States, we distribute Retail Communications and Payment Services products, including Boss Revolution PIN-less, IMTU and DMTU offerings, money remittance and bill payment services and prepaid calling cards primarily to retail outlets through our network of distributors or through our internal sales force. In addition, our private label calling cards as well as our IDT-branded calling cards are also marketed to retail chains and outlets through our internal sales force, and from time to time, we may utilize third-party agents or brokers to acquire accounts. We also market offerings, including Boss Revolution PIN-less IMTU and DMTU and international money transfer directly to the consumer via online channels including the Boss Revolution consumer website (www.bossrevolution.com) and mobile apps for iOS and Android. 
 
In Europe and Latin America, we are a provider of prepaid calling cards including both private label and IDT-branded calling cards, which are sold through a network of independent retailers as well as through our own internal sales force. Additionally, we sell Boss Revolution PIN-less international calling and IMTU and DMTU in select markets both through retailers and directly to consumers. In Asia, we sell Boss Revolution direct to consumers online and through our Boss Revolution calling app and postpaid services direct to consumers and small businesses. In the United Kingdom, we sell the Prime Card, a leading prepaid MasterCard through select retailers and online directly to consumers. Wholesale Carrier Services are marketed and sold through our internal Carrier Services account management team. In Canada, we sell Boss Revolution platform products through retailers, our mobile calling app, and direct-to-consumer web sites.
 
Telecommunications Network Infrastructure
 
We operate a global network to provide an array of telecommunications and payment services to our customers worldwide using a combination of proprietary and third-party applications. Proprietary applications include call routing and rating, customer provisioning, call management, e-commerce sites, product web pages, calling card features, and payment services features. Proprietary applications provide the flexibility to adapt to evolving marketplace demands without waiting for third-party software releases, and often provide advantages in capability or cost over commercially available alternatives.
 
Our core voice network utilizes VoIP and is interconnected, where needed, through gateways to time-division multiplexing, or TDM, networks worldwide. This hybrid IP/TDM capability allows us to interface with carriers using the lowest cost technology protocol available. To support our global reach, we operate voice switches and/or points of presence in the United States, Europe, South America, Asia and Australia. We receive and terminate voice traffic from every country in the world, including cellular, landline and satellite calls through direct and indirect interconnects. The network includes data centers located in the United States, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, which house equipment used for both our voice and payment services, with smaller points of presence in several other countries. It is monitored and operated on a continual basis by our Network Operations Center in the United States. More recently, we started to make use of one of the leading cloud providers to serve as host for some of our application infrastructure.
 
net2phone-Unified Communications as a Service (net2phone--UCaaS)
 
net2phone-UCaaS’ revenue was $34.9 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $29.5 million in fiscal 2017. net2phone-UCaaS’ loss from operations was $2.7 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $1.9 million in fiscal 2017.
 
net2phone-UCaaS’ revenue is generated primarily by VoIP products and services sold under the net2phone brand. net2phone-UCaaS’ offerings include (1) cloud-based PBX services offered to enterprise customers mainly through value-added resellers, service providers, telecom agents and managed service providers, (2) SIP trunking, which supports inbound and outbound domestic and international calling from an IP PBX, and (3) cable telephony. In fiscal 2017, net2phone-UCaaS launched cloud-based PBX services in Brazil and Argentina, leveraging our local licenses, telephony platform and infrastructure. In fiscal 2018, net2phone-UCaaS expanded into new markets in South America, Europe and Asia focusing on its cloud-based PBX product set.

net2phone-UCaaS continues to optimize and improve its cable telephony platform to reduce the underlying costs of service and increase the speed of deployment.
 
In September 2018, net2phone acquired Versature, a rapidly growing Software as a Service, or SaaS, business communications solutions and hosted VoIP provider serving the Canadian market. With the Versature acquisition, net2phone now operates in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Colombia.  net2phone also recently launched in Hong Kong and Spain.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
net2phone-UCaaS has historically focused on the agent channel marketplace by partnering with service providers, distributors, system integrators, telecom agents and master agents domestically and internationally. These partners utilize net2phone-UCaaS’ full suite of VoIP communication solutions focusing on net2phone-UCaaS’ SIP trunking and hosted PBX solutions. net2phone-UCaaS’ Cable Telephony unit white labels net2phone’s residential, broadband telephony solution to complete the cable operator’s triple play. net2phone-UCaaS also white labels its hosted PBX solution for the operator’s business customers, allowing their enterprise end users to capitalize on the growth, flexibility and cost advantages of IP-based calling.
All Other
 
Operating segments that are not reportable individually are included in All Other. From fiscal 2018, All Other included only Zedge and our real estate holdings and other investments. Zedge was spun off on June 1, 2016 and the real estate and other investments were included in Rafael that was spun off on March 26, 2018. A small business that was previously included in All Other has been reclassified to TPS, and certain other cost centers have been reclassified to Corporate. Comparative results have been reclassified and restated as if these businesses and costs were included in TPS or Corporate in all periods presented. During fiscal 2018, All Other generated $1.2 million in revenues and loss from operations of $2.6 million, compared to revenues of $2.3 million and income from operations of $0.1 million during fiscal 2017.
Competition
 
Telecom & Payment Services
 
Retail Communications
 
Like all international calling services, our Boss Revolution PIN-less service is subject to fierce competition, and we do not expect to continue to grow revenues and margins without a successful strategy and sound execution. While virtually any company offering communication services is a competitor of our Retail Communications offerings, we face particularly strong competition from Tier 1 mobile network operators who offer flat rate international calling plans, other PIN-less prepaid voice offerings, prepaid calling card providers, mobile virtual network operators, and VoIP and other “over the top” (OTT) service providers. Outside the United States, we also compete with large foreign state-owned or state sanctioned telephone companies.
 
Many of these companies, such as AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint, are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical, engineering, personnel and marketing resources, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and larger customer bases than we do. The use by these competitors of their resources in or affecting the international prepaid calling market could significantly impact our ability to compete against them successfully.
 
In addition to these larger competitors, we face significant competition from smaller prepaid calling providers, who from time-to-time offer rates that are substantially below our rates, and in some instances below what we believe to be the cost to provide the service, to gain market share. This type of pricing by one or more competitors can adversely affect our revenues, as they gain market share at our expense, and our gross margins, if we lower rates to better compete.
 
The continued growth of Over-The-Top calling and messaging services, such as Skype, Viber, and WhatsApp has adversely affected the sales of Boss Revolution and our other prepaid calling services. We expect the popularity of IP-based services—many of which offer voice communications for free provided both the caller and recipient have a broadband connection—to continue to increase, which may result in increased substitution and pricing pressure on our Boss Revolution and other international prepaid calling service offerings.
 
Certain wireless operators have been rolling out unlimited international long-distance plans that include international destinations to which customers can place direct calls from their mobile phones without time limitation. These plans now include some of our most popular international destinations. The growth of these “international unlimited” plans adversely affects our revenues as these operators gain subscriber market share.

In our view, our ability to compete successfully against these operators depends on several factors. Our interconnect and termination agreements, network infrastructure and least-cost-routing system enable us to offer low-cost, high quality services. Our extensive distribution and retail networks provide us with a strong presence in communities of foreign-born residents, a significant portion of which purchase our services with cash. Our Boss Revolution brand is often highly visible in these communities and has a reputation for quality service and competitive, transparent pricing. Finally, we also offer synergistic payment services over the Boss Revolution platform that customers can conveniently access from their accounts. In our view, these factors represent competitive advantages.
 
However, some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition and can provide comparable service levels and pricing through established brands. Consequently, our ability to maintain and/or to capture additional market share will remain dependent upon our ability to continue to provide competitively priced services, expand our distribution and retail networks, improve our ability to reach and sell to customers through mobile devices, develop successful new products and services to fit the evolving needs of our customers, and continue to build the brand equity of Boss Revolution.
 
Wholesale Carrier Services
 
The wholesale carrier industry has numerous entities competing for the same customers, primarily based on price, products and quality of service.
 
In our Wholesale Carrier Services business, we participate in a global market place with:
 

§ | interexchange carriers and other long-distance resellers and providers, including large carriers such as T Mobile, AT&T and Verizon;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | historically state-owned or state-sanctioned telephone companies such as Telefonica, France Telecom and KDDI;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | on-line, spot-market trading exchanges for voice minutes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


§ | OTT internet telephony providers;
--+----------------------------------


§ | other VoIP providers;
--+----------------------


§ | other providers of international long-distance services; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


§ | alliances between large multinational carriers that provide wholesale carrier services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our Wholesale Carrier Services business derives a competitive advantage from several inter-related factors: our Retail Communications business generates large volumes of originating minutes, which represents a desirable, negotiable asset that helps us win return traffic and obtain beneficial pricing which we can offer in the wholesale arena; the proprietary technologies powering our wholesale platform and in particular, the software that drives voice over internet protocols enables us to scale up at a lower cost than many of our competitors; our professional and experienced account management; and our extensive network of interconnects around the globe, with the ability to connect in whichever format (IP or TDM) is most feasible. In aggregate, these factors provide us with a competitive advantage over some participants on certain routes.
 
Payment Services
 
The major competitors to Payment Services’ offerings include:
 

§ | international mobile operators, who seek to control more of their own distribution channel or create their own products that directly compete with our international airtime top-up;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | other distributors, who develop a more comprehensive product offering than our international airtime top-up offerings or aggressively discount their product offerings that are like our international airtime top-up offerings; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | traditional international money transfer services such as Western Union and MoneyGram and a number of small niche money transfer organizations that serve specific destination corridors, as well as new entrants trying to disrupt the money transfer market such as Xoom, TransferWise and World-Remit.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
net2phone-UCaaS
 
Some of the major competitors to our net2phone-UCaaS offerings include other UCaaS and or hosted voice providers such as Vonage Business, Nextiva, 8x8, West Corp, and Ring Central. Due to their longevity and substantial investments in the space, these providers offer a more advanced product set that includes features such as video, chat, collaboration, and analytics. These competitors, in addition to possessing more widely recognized brands, also support integration of their services with other well-known, third-party customer relationship management, or CRM, vendors such as SalesForce and SugarCRM as well as with various Google applications.

REGULATION
 
The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation is intended to describe what we believe to be the most important, but not all, current and proposed international, federal, state and local laws, regulations, orders and legislation that are likely to materially affect us.
 
Regulation of Telecom in the United States
 
Telecommunications services are subject to extensive government regulation at both the federal and state levels in the United States. Any violations of the regulations may subject us to enforcement actions, including interest and penalties. The Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, has jurisdiction over all telecommunications common carriers to the extent they provide interstate or international communications services, including the use of local networks to originate or terminate such services. Each state regulatory commission has jurisdiction over the same carriers with respect to their provision of local and intrastate communications services. Local governments often indirectly regulate aspects of our communications business by imposing zoning requirements, taxes, permit or right-of-way procedures or franchise fees. Significant changes to the applicable laws or regulations imposed by any of these regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 
Regulation of Telecom by the Federal Communications Commission
 
Universal Service and Other Regulatory Fees and Charges
 
In 1997, the FCC issued an order, referred to as the Universal Service Order, that requires all telecommunications carriers providing interstate telecommunications services to contribute to universal service support programs administered by the FCC (known as the Universal Service Fund). In addition, beginning in October 2006, interconnected VoIP providers, such as our subsidiary net2phone, are required to contribute to the Universal Service Fund. These periodic contributions are currently assessed based on a percentage of each contributor’s interstate and international end user telecommunications revenues reported to the FCC. We also contribute to several other regulatory funds and programs, most notably Telecommunications Relay Service, FCC Regulatory Fees, and Local Number Portability (collectively, the Other Funds). We and most of our competitors pass through Universal Service Fund and Other Funds contributions as part of the price of our services, either as part of the base rate or, to the extent allowed, as a separate surcharge on customer bills. Due to the manner in which these contributions are calculated, we cannot be assured that we fully recover from our customers all of our contributions. In addition, based on the nature of our current business, we receive certain exemptions from federal Universal Service Fund contributions. Changes in our business could eliminate our ability to qualify for some or all of these exemptions. As a result, our ability to pursue certain new business opportunities in the future may be constrained in order to maintain these exemptions, the elimination of which could materially affect the rates we would need to charge for existing services. Changes in regulation may also have an impact on the availability of some or all of these exemptions. If even some of these exemptions become unavailable, they could materially increase our federal Universal Service Fund or Other Funds’ contributions and have a material adverse effect on the cost of our operations and, therefore, on our ability to continue to operate profitably, and to develop and grow our business. We cannot be certain of the stability of the contribution factors for the Other Funds. Significant increases in the contribution factor for the Other Funds in general and the Telecommunications Relay Service Fund in particular can impact our profitability. Whether these contribution factors will be stable in the future is unknown, but it is possible that we will be subject to significant increases.
Customer Proprietary Network Information
 
In 2007, the FCC increased its regulatory oversight of Customer Proprietary Network Information, or CPNI. The FCC took this increased role in response to several high-profile cases of “pretexting,” which occurs when an individual secures from a communications provider, through deception, the private phone records of another person. We have a CPNI compliance policy in place and we believe we currently meet or exceed all FCC requirements for the protection of CPNI. However, we cannot be assured that we are in full compliance and if the FCC were to conclude that we were not in compliance, we could be subject to fines or other forms of sanction.
Regulation of Telecom by State Public Utility Commissions
 
Our telecommunications services that originate and terminate within the same state, including both local and in-state long distance services are subject to the jurisdiction of that state’s public utility commission. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, generally preempts state statutes and regulations that prevent the provision of competitive services but permits state public utility commissions to regulate the rates, terms and conditions of intrastate services, so long as such regulation is not inconsistent with the requirements of federal law. We are certified to provide facilities-based and/or resold long-distance service in all 50 states and facilities-based and resold local exchange service in 45 states. In addition to requiring certification, state regulatory authorities may impose tariff and filing requirements, consumer protection measures, and obligations to contribute to universal service and other funds. Rates for intrastate switched access services, which we both pay to local exchange companies and collect from long-distance companies for terminating in-state toll calls, are subject to the jurisdiction of the state commissions. State commissions also have jurisdiction to approve negotiated rates, or establish rates through arbitration, for interconnection, including rates for unbundled network elements. Changes in those access charges or rates for unbundled network elements could have a substantial and material impact on our business.

Regulation of Telecom—International
 
In connection with our international operations, we have obtained licenses or are otherwise authorized to provide telecommunications services in various foreign countries. We have obtained licenses or authorizations in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. In numerous countries where we operate or plan to operate, we are subject to many local laws and regulations that, among other things, may restrict or limit the ability of telecommunications companies to provide telecommunications services in competition with state-owned or state-sanctioned dominant carriers.
 
Regulation of Internet Telephony
 
The use of the Internet and private IP networks to provide voice communications services is generally less regulated than traditional switch-based telephony within the United States and abroad and, in many markets, is not subject to the imposition of certain taxes and fees that increase our costs. As a result, we are able, in many markets, to offer VoIP communications services at rates that are more attractive than those applicable to traditional telephone services. However, in the U.S. and abroad, there have been efforts by legislatures and regulators to harmonize the regulatory structures between traditional switch-based telephony and VoIP. This could result in additional fees, charges, taxes and regulations on IP communications services that could materially increase our costs and may limit or eliminate our competitive pricing advantages. Additionally, several foreign governments have adopted laws and/or regulations that could restrict or prohibit the provision of voice communications services over the Internet or private IP networks. These efforts could likewise harm our ability to offer VoIP communications services.
Money Transmitter and Payment Instrument Laws and Regulations
 
Our consumer payment services offerings include money transfer and various network branded (also called “open loop”) prepaid card offerings. These industries are heavily regulated. Accordingly, we, and the products and services that we market in consumer payment services, are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations, including:

§ | Banking laws and regulations;
--+------------------------------


§ | Money transmitter and payment instrument laws and regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Anti-money laundering laws;
--+----------------------------


§ | Privacy and data security laws and regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------


§ | Consumer protection laws and regulations;
--+------------------------------------------


§ | Unclaimed property laws; and
--+-----------------------------


§ | Card association and network organization rules.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 
In connection with the development of our money transmission services and the expansion of our network branded prepaid card offerings, we have actively pursued our own money transmitter licenses. At July 31, 2018, we had received a money transmitter license in 47 of the 49 U.S. states that require such a license, as well as in Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C.
 
Regulation of Other Businesses
 
We operate other smaller or early-stage initiatives and operations, which may be subject to federal, state, local or foreign law and regulation.
 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
We own numerous patents, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad; in particular our registered trademarks and brands: IDT®, Boss Revolution®, and Net2Phone®. From time to time we have also acquired or licensed intellectual property relating to present and future business strategy.  We believe that our technological position significantly depends on the technical experience, expertise, and creative ability of our employees to maintain both our current businesses and pursue future business development. Our corporate policies require all employees to assign intellectual property rights developed in the scope of, or in relation to our business to us, and to protect all intellectual property and proprietary information and materials as confidential.
 
Our global telecommunications switching and transmission infrastructure enables us to provide an array of telecommunications, Internet access and Internet telephony services to our customers worldwide. We rely upon domestic and foreign patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property rights, regarding our infrastructure and global telecommunication network for our international telecommunications traffic and the international traffic of other telecommunications companies. 
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of October 1, 2018, we had a total of approximately 1,075 employees, of which approximately 1,060 were full-time employees.
