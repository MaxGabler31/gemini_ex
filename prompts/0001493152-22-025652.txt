Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
American Battery Technology Company (“ABTC”, “the Company”, or “we”) is a technology development and commercialization company in the lithium-ion battery industry. The Company is working to increase the domestic US production of critical battery metals. To do so, we are engaged in (i) the exploration of new primary resources of battery metals, (ii) the development and commercialization of new technologies for the extraction and refining of these battery metals from primary resources, and (iii) the commercialization of an internally-developed integrated process for the recycling of lithium-ion batteries for the recovery of battery metals. Through this three-pronged approach we are working to both increase the domestic production of these battery metals through the acquisition and exploration of mining claims and to ensure that as these materials reach their end of lives that the constituent elemental metals are returned to the domestic manufacturing supply chain in a closed-loop fashion.
 
ABTC’s corporate headquarters are in Reno, Nevada, USA. The Company is constructing the ABTC Pilot Plant (“ABTC Pilot Plant” or “Pilot Plant”) for recycling lithium-ion batteries in Fernley, Nevada, USA, and its exploration office is located in Tonopah, Nevada, USA.
 
Company History
 
The Company was incorporated as Oroplata Resources, Inc. under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 6, 2011, for the purpose of acquiring rights to mineral properties with the eventual objective of being a producing mineral company. On August 8, 2016, the Company formed Lithortech Resources Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to serve as its operating subsidiary for lithium resource exploration and development. On June 29, 2018, the Company changed the name of Lithortech Resources to LithiumOre Corp. (“LithiumOre”). On May 3, 2019, the Company changed its name to American Battery Metals Corporation. On August 12, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the State of Nevada to change its name to American Battery Technology Company, which better aligns with the Company’s current business activities and future objectives. The Company has limited operating history and has not yet generated or realized revenues from its primary business activities.
Industry Overview
 
Lithium-ion batteries have become the rechargeable battery of choice in cell phones, computers, electric vehicles, and large scale electric stationary storage systems. Global production capacity of lithium-ion batteries was approximately 1,040 gigawatt hours per year (“GWh/yr”) at the end of 2021 and is forecasted to grow to approximately 6,700 GWh/yr by 2031, primarily driven by demand for electric vehicles. There are significant regulatory and social tailwinds driving demand growth for electric vehicles and large-format energy storage. This, in turn, is driving significant demand for battery metals and precursor materials, primarily lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese.
 
Lithium-ion batteries are designed in a variety of form-factors and chemistries. Current cell-level form-factors utilized are primarily cylindrical, prismatic, and pouch geometries. The most common battery cathode chemistries that have emerged are lithiated nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (“NCA”), lithiated nickel manganese cobalt oxide (“NMC”), lithiated cobalt oxide (“LCO”), and lithiated iron phosphate (“LFP”). The most common battery anode chemistries consist of graphite, silicon, and lithium metal. These chemistries are expected to evolve based on the development of new technologies and the availability, cost, and life-cycle environmental footprint of required minerals.
 
The current manufacturing supply chain for lithium-ion batteries is segmented and is organized into sub-industries that operate in series in a closed-loop fashion:
 

● | battery material providers, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | chemical refiners, 
● | cell manufacturers, and 
● | end-use product (electric vehicle, stationary storage, consumer electronics, etc.) manufacturers. 



Battery material providers can be classified into two categories: primary producers who explore for and extract virgin resources, and secondary producers who extract minerals from scrap and end-of-life products for re-sale into the lithium-ion battery supply chain. ABTC intends to operate in the battery material supply segment, which is discussed in greater detail below.
 
Chemical refiners source battery-grade materials from suppliers to manufacture into cell components, including cathodes, anodes, electrolytes, and separators. The majority of global refining capacity is currently located in Asia.
 
Cell manufacturers source cell components and assemble those components into modules and packs, which are then sold to Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM” or “OEMs”). Cell manufacturing is currently concentrated in China, with the country accounting for over 75% of global cell manufacturing capacity.
 
The OEM segment is the final step to manufacturing an end-use product. OEM manufacturing capacity for electric vehicles, stationary storage, and consumer electronics is distributed globally.
 
Each segment of the lithium-ion battery supply chain has seen disparate quantities of investment, with those variations further pronounced with specific geographies. Investment in battery material suppliers, both primary and secondary, and chemical refining capacity, has been far outpaced by investments in cell manufacturing and end-use OEMs, with anticipated battery production capacity forecasted to be ~10x the forecasted capacity for precursor metal refining. This disconnect in available feedstock and refining capacity has caused significant imbalances in the global supply chain, with those imbalances even more pronounced within the USA. Further, while there is significant cell manufacturing and OEM manufacturing capacity in the USA, less than 1% of global battery materials needed to supply these facilities are sourced within the USA, resulting in a severe domestic capacity imbalance. This risk in the security and cost of supply has resulted in numerous issues for industries reliant on lithium-ion batteries and has the potential to setback the adoption of electric vehicles and renewable energy storage.

Overview of Battery Materials Supply
 
Supply of battery materials is dominated by primary production, with primary supply forecasted to account for ~75% or more of global production of each of the critical materials necessary for the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries. Development of new sources of primary supply are typically subject to long lead times and high capital costs, putting further constraints on the supply of these materials. In addition, the majority of primary production is concentrated in high geopolitical risk locations. Each of the primary minerals discussed are traded on a number of global commodity exchanges and market pricing for each is readily available. Additional details on the primary development of the main critical materials are discussed below:
 
Lithium: Primary lithium is extracted from lithium brines, hard rock deposits, and lithium-bearing claystone resources. Lithium brine deposits are accumulations of saline groundwater that are enriched in dissolved lithium. These deposits can be found in salt flats (such as those in South America), geothermal deposits (such as the Salton Sea in California), and oil fields. Extraction of lithium from brines typically involves large-scale evaporation techniques, thus consuming large amounts of water and energy. Hard rock sources of lithium are typically found in spodumene pegmatite deposits and are mined using conventional mining and processing techniques. Extraction of lithium from claystone resources is a relatively new technique with various extraction technologies currently under development. Brine extraction currently accounts for the largest share of primary lithium production and is primarily sourced from South America.
 Nickel: Primary nickel is mined from both surface and underground operations. Traditional processing techniques for nickel involve crushing, leaching, and floatation techniques. The primary competing source of demand for nickel is the steel industry, for both a steel alloy and in plating of stainless steel. Supply is currently dominated by production from Indonesia.
 Cobalt: Cobalt is typically mined from open pit and underground operations using traditional mining and processing techniques. The majority of cobalt production is a by-product of copper or nickel production. The competing source of demand for cobalt is steel production where cobalt is utilized as a high-strength steel alloy. Concentration of supply from the Democratic Republic of Congo has given rise to significant environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) concerns over the supply of primary cobalt resources.
 Manganese: Manganese is typically mined from open pit surface mines using traditional mining and processing techniques. As with the previously mentioned minerals, the primary competing source of demand is steel production, where manganese is used as an alloy and to deoxidize steel. South Africa is the world’s largest producer of manganese, followed by Australia, and China.
 Secondary supply of feedstock, or recycling, is a relatively new market segment that has seen limited investment compared to the other segments of the battery supply chain. Current recycling techniques can be classified into two categories: High temperature thermal processes and mechanical crushing/simple hydrometallurgy processes. Both techniques process the feedstock batteries into an intermediate compound, a metal matte or black mass, which is then processed through a refining process to extract the constituent metals. Both processes mainly focus on the recovery of nickel and cobalt. The majority of these operations are located in China, the USA, and Europe.
 
High temperature thermal processes currently account for the majority of current recycling operations. Batteries are placed into high-temperature furnaces and melted. A number of the key battery minerals are lost in the high temperature processing and smelting phase, including lithium, graphite, and aluminum. The remaining metal matte is then processed through a hydrometallurgical refining process. The high temperature processing can present challenges to refining the metal matte from this process into products that meet the high purity specifications required for battery cathode manufacturing. Further, the process is energy intensive and causes substantial air and water pollution.
 
The mechanical crushing/simple hydrometallurgy approach involves placing batteries into large shredding/grinding machines. The resulting shredded material is then processed to produce a black mass. This resulting back mass is then processed through a bulk hydrometallurgical process designed to remove impurities and extract the high-value minerals. The high level of impurities in the black mass resulting from the shredding/grinding process makes the recovery of battery grade materials challenging. Additionally, the solvents used in the extraction process have adverse environmental impacts and significantly increase the costs associated with the recycling process.
 
The black mass resulting from the recycling process has become a readily tradable commodity. However, the quality and value of the black mass is highly variable based on the chemistry of the battery (NCA, NMC, LCO, LFP, etc.) that is being processed and the amount of remaining impurities in the material. Metal refiners are developing processes to extract battery-grade materials from the various forms of black mass. The market, and thus pricing, for black mass is still developing.
 
The overall market and pricing for battery feedstock materials will be driven by the supply/demand balance of each commodity. Chemical refiners require specific purity and quality standards for the inputs for their manufacturing processes. Competition will be based on the ability of producers, both primary and secondary, to deliver reliable quantities of materials that meet the specifications required in the battery manufacturing process, while maintaining cash costs that are below the marginal cost of supply.

Our Business
 
Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling
 
ABTC has developed a universal lithium-ion battery recycling system that is able to recycle batteries of a wide range of form factors (packs, modules, cylindrical cells, prismatic cells, pouch cells, defect and intermediate waste cells, metal scraps, slurries, and powders) and of a wide range of cathode chemistries (lithiated cobalt oxide, lithiated nickel-cobalt-aluminum oxide, lithiated nickel-cobalt-manganese oxide, lithiated nickel-cobalt-manganese-aluminum oxide, lithiated nickel-oxide, and lithiated manganese-oxide) of various relative weighting of transition metals.
 
The ABTC recycling process is a two-phase process: an automated de-manufacturing process followed by a targeted chemical extraction train to separate the individual high-value metals. The Company intends to commission each phase in sequence. Phase 1, the automated de-manufacturing process, separates the components of battery feedstock material into its constituent components, including scrap metals and cathode and anode powders in the form of black mass filter cake. Scrap metals are then sold as byproducts under various offtake agreements or into the open scrap market. The black mass filter cake produced in this phase will also be sold under offtake contracts or into the open market. Upon commissioning of Phase 2, the black mass produced in Phase 1 will be fed into a proprietary chemical extraction train to extract lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese elemental metals and upgrade them to the battery cathode grade specifications demanded by high energy density cathode manufacturers. The commissioning of Phase 1 is expected to occur in the first half of calendar year 2023 and the commissioning of Phase 2 in the first half of calendar year 2024.
 
ABTC has leveraged the experience of certain members of its leadership team who worked on the design, construction, commissioning, and optimization of one of the largest lithium-ion battery manufacturing factories in the world. This experience has enabled the team to leverage their knowledge of the failure mechanisms that can cause battery components, cells, and modules to fail leading to the development an automated deconstruction process combined with a targeted hydrometallurgical, non-smelting process that deconstructs battery packs to modules, modules to cells, cells to subcell components, and then sorting and separating those subcell components in a strategic fashion. Because of our uniquely pioneered recycling process, we are able to realize greater net benefits than current conventional methods. These benefits include:
 

● | Avoidance of air and liquid pollutant emissions through strategic design, no high-temperature operations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Separation of low value materials early in the processing train allows for high recovery and purity of high value products; 
● | Metal products manufactured to meet battery cathode specifications are able to re-enter supply chain in closed-loop fashion; 
● | Throughput of recycling facilities equal to that of manufacturing facilities, per region; 
● | Low capital costs, through avoidance of high-temperature operations and minimal generation of waste; and 
● | Short processing residence times through high-speed strategic disassembly and material handling. 

 
Additional details regarding the ABTC Pilot Plant are discussed in Item 2. Properties.
 
Industry Collaborations
 
In September 2019, ABTC was selected as the sole winner of the battery recycling portion of the Circularity Challenge hosted by BASF, Stanley Black & Decker, and Greentown Labs. BASF is one of the largest high-energy density cathode manufacturing companies in the USA and one of the largest global purchasers of lithium-ion battery metal materials. The challenge was developed to encourage new, innovative technologies for the recycling of large-format lithium-ion batteries, with an ultimate goal to establish a circular economy in the battery supply chain. Participants were asked to demonstrate their ability to recycle an end-of-life lithium-ion battery into battery grade minerals that could then be used for the manufacture of new lithium-ion batteries. As the winner, ABTC received seed funding, access to the Greentown Labs facilities (see Item 2. Properties), and the exploration of partnership agreements with the host companies. ABTC and BASF continue to explore several avenues of collaboration to accelerate the commercialization of ABTC’s lithium-ion battery recycling technology.
 
In October 2021, ABTC, as a co-grantee, received a competitively bid $2 million contract award from the US Advanced Battery Consortium (“USABC”). USABC is a subsidiary of the United States Council for Automotive Research LLC and enabled by a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy. The member companies include General Motors, Ford Motor Company, and Stellantis NV. USABC’s mission is to develop electrochemical energy storage technologies that advance commercialization of next generation electrified vehicle applications. The objective of the contract award is for the commercial-scale development and demonstration of an integrated lithium-ion battery recycling system, the production of battery cathode grade metal products, the synthesis of high energy density active cathode material from these recycled battery metals by cathode producer and lithium-ion battery recycler BASF, and then the fabrication of large format automotive battery cells from these recycled materials and the testing of these cells against otherwise identical cells made from virgin sourced metals by cell technology developer C4V. The demonstration of the entire closed-loop battery manufacturing supply chain within a single project is meant to foster the establishment of a domestic low-cost and low-environmental impact battery recycling infrastructure.

Competition
 
ABTC expects to recover several types of byproducts as well as battery cathode grade lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese products through its recycling process and will compete with two categories of producers of these commodities: Competing recycling process and facilities and primary producers of the battery materials ABTC recovers as part of its recycling process.
 
Competing recycling processes and facilities are primarily located in the USA, Europe, and China and employ various techniques for extraction of the contained battery metals. In general, processes that employ high-temperature thermal processes or shredding/solvent extraction techniques focus on the recovery of nickel and cobalt, with limited ability to recover lithium, manganese, or other metals. ABTC’s process to extract each of the battery components enables the Company to extract additional value from the same amount of feedstock to enable low-cost and low-environmental operations.
 
Primary producers of lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese are distributed globally. Lithium production is largely located in the Americas, Australia, and Asia. Approximately two-thirds of cobalt production is sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Nickel production is dominated by Indonesia, China, and Australia. Manganese production is concentrated in South Africa, Australia, and China.
 
The commodities and specialty chemicals that are ultimately used by cathode manufacturers are required to meet stringent specifications, whether that mineral is sourced from a primary or a secondary resource. Thus, the competition in these markets will be based on product quality and reliability of supply.
 
Primary Resource Development & Refining
 
ABTC has been designing and optimizing our internally developed sustainable lithium extraction process for the manufacturing of battery cathode grade lithium hydroxide from Nevada-based sedimentary claystone primary resources. We are currently conducting exploratory drilling programs on over 10,000 acres as part of our Tonopah Flats Lithium Exploration Project. (See Item 2. Properties for additional information).
 
ABTC is currently conducting geological mapping, sampling, geochemical analysis, and proprietary extraction trials to characterize the resource and to quantify the performance of the lithium extraction and manufacturing operations. In parallel with the current exploration activities, the Company is designing and constructing a multi-tonne per day pilot scale facility to process sedimentary resource from the project. This facility is intended to demonstrate the commercial viability of ABTC’s extraction and refining processes. The Company will continue to analyze the economic competitiveness of the project throughout the demonstration phases.
 
ABTC’s in-house developed extraction technologies do not require the harmful and inefficient evaporation ponds associated with conventional lithium-from-brine mining. Our extraction process utilizes a selective leaching process for the low-cost extraction of lithium from claystone sedimentary resources that allows for significantly lower consumption of acid, lower levels of contaminants in the generated leach liquor, and lower overall costs of production.
 
Industry Collaborations
 
In October 2021, ABTC, as the primary grantee, with DuPont Water Solutions as a sub-grantee, was awarded a $4.5 million competitive grant through the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office, Critical Materials Innovation program to advance the research, development, and commercialization of its technologies for the manufacturing of battery grade lithium hydroxide from its lithium-bearing claystone deposits. The grant provided partial funding for the development of a multi-tonne per day processing facility to implement its lithium refining technology at pilot facility scale.
Competition
 
Primary lithium production is concentrated in the Americas, Australia, and Asia. The lithium that is ultimately used by cathode manufacturers is required to meet stringent specifications, whether that mineral is sourced from a primary or a secondary resource. Thus, the competition in these markets will be based on product quality and reliability of supply.
