Item 1. Business.
Corporate History
 
The Company was originally incorporated with the name Brilliant Acquisition, Inc., under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 25, 2014, with an objective to acquire, or merge with, an operating business.
 
On January 12, 2016, Thomas DeNunzio of 780 Reservoir Avenue, #123, Cranston, RI 02910, the sole shareholder of the Company, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with e-Learning Laboratory Co., Ltd. (“e-Learning”), with an address at 1-23-38-6F, Esakacho, Suita-shi, Osaka 564-0063 Japan. Pursuant to the Agreement, Mr. DeNunzio transferred to e-Learning Laboratory Co., Ltd., 20,000,000 shares of our common stock which represented all of our issued and outstanding shares at the time of sale.
 
Following the closing of the share purchase transaction, e-Learning gained a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and became the controlling shareholder of the Company.
 
On January 12, 2016, the Company changed its name to Exceed World, Inc. and filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, a Certificate of Amendment.
 
On January 12, 2016, Mr. Thomas DeNunzio resigned as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer. The resignation was not the result of any disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.
 
On January 12, 2016, Mr. Tomoo Yoshida was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer.
 
On February 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Tomoo Yoshida, our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer. Pursuant to this Agreement, Tomoo Yoshida transferred to Exceed World, Inc., 10 shares of the common stock of E&F Co., Ltd., a Japan corporation (“E&F”), which represented all of its issued and outstanding shares in consideration of $4,835 (JPY 500,000). Following the effective date of the share purchase transaction on February 29, 2016, Exceed World, Inc. gained a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of E&F’s common stock and E&F became a wholly owned subsidiary of Exceed World.  On August 4, 2016, the E&F changed its name to School TV Co., Ltd (“School TV”) and filed such amendment with the Legal Affairs Bureau in Osaka, Japan.

The aforementioned sale of shares was exempt from registration in accordance with Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Regulation S") because the above sales of the stock were made to non-U.S. persons (as defined under Rule 902 section (k)(2)(i) of Regulation S), pursuant to offshore transactions, and no directed selling efforts were made in the United States by the issuer, a distributor, any of their respective affiliates, or any person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing.

These shares were sold pursuant to the Company’s effective S-1 Registration Statement deemed effective on July 20, 2016 at 4pm EST. 
 
On October 28, 2016, Exceed World, Inc., a Delaware corporation, (the “Company”), with the approval of its board of directors and its majority shareholders by written consent in lieu of a meeting, authorized the cancellation of shares owned by e-Learning Laboratory Co, Ltd. e-Learning Laboratory Co, Ltd. has provided consent for the cancellation of shares.

*We conduct several facets of business. Each is described below, in a separate section, organized in descending order of importance based upon the immediacy of revenue generation for the Company.
 
Nature of Business: Sale of Health Products
 

*The chart above does not depict when we make direct sales to consumers. 
 
As depicted in the diagram above School TV Co., Ltd., herein referred to as “School TV” is our wholly owned subsidiary through whom we operate exclusively at this time. School TV sells primarily health related consumer goods to distributors and consumers alike. At this time School TV primarily operates under the operational model of “drop shipping.” It should be noted however, that School TV does hold inventory and sells products directly to the consumer from time to time. For products sold through our drop shipping model, after a purchase order has been filled out by a consumer the product is shipped out by School TV’s suppliers, rather than School TV. School TV sends a portion of the proceeds from the sale of any our products directly to suppliers when sold through the dropshipping model. This accounts for Exceed’s cost of the good and any other related expenses. Revenues generated from the sale of inventory held directly by School TV are retained entirely by School TV. We are responsible for shipping goods sold that come from our own supply of inventory.
 
School TV has acquired its physical inventory, which will be explained in further detail below, from suppliers, and has plans to acquire additional inventory from as of yet unidentified suppliers.
 
Currently, School TV has future intentions to create an online marketplace to sell goods through but at this time, has not yet begun pursuing development of such a marketplace or website. Plans and timeline of such also remain undetermined. 
 
We currently have no storefront and there is no guarantees that we will ever obtain a storefront. At this time we are not actively seeking to acquire a storefront and we rely exclusively on personal relationships of our Chief Executive Officer to sell our current inventory.

Process of Ordering, Delivery and Payment
 
Should a purchaser purchase a health related supplement or product directly from School TV, the Company provides the purchaser a “call sheet” or in other words a purchase order form which includes but is not limited to, basic information on the purchaser, the shipping address of the purchaser, and payment details of the purchaser. School TV offers standard methods of shipping for its products at the cost of the purchaser. School TV bills the purchaser directly as the purchase is from School TV’s own stock of inventory.
 
Purchasers may also decide to purchase products through particular ‘distributors’ or sales agents of School TV. In this case the distributors receive a commission decided upon by the Company on a case by case basis. Payments, billing, and shipping are still handled by School TV.
 
For products not available in School TV’s inventory, the Company utilizes the drop-shipping model described in the proceeding paragraphs. In this case School TV is responsible for collecting payment and shipping information from the purchaser and then provides this information to the supplier at which time the supplier bills the purchaser for the purchase of the product(s) and handles any shipping of the product(s) thereafter. A commission is then paid to School TV for facilitating the transaction. Commissions are on a case by case basis with no set commission. 
 
Competition - Health, Food, and Related Goods
 
Our primary competition comes from other health food and supplement companies within Japan, but can also include global companies who offer their products within Japan. Some of our competitors have larger resources than we have, a longer operating history, and established connections throughout our target regions, which may make it difficult to penetrate into the market effectively. Even if we do manage to penetrate into the health food and or supplement market with our products there can be no guarantee that we will be able to continue to compete effectively with these established competitors.
 
Our competition includes, but is not limited to, MUSO Co., Ltd, Asahi Food & Healthcare Co., Ltd., Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Several of these competitors have an established track record in Japan and offer highly valued products throughout the country, which may serve to make it more difficult for our own products to gain attention as we begin operations.
 
Nature of Business: Promotional Activity
 
In addition to our retail and drop-shipping business described above we also provide promotional services for third party businesses and receive a commission upon the sale of such product(s) or service(s). Included below we have disclosed the name, and principal good or service, of each third party business to whom we presently offer promotional services.

Nature of Business: RE/MAX business


Basic structure



Kanagawa region and Okinawa region
 
On July 7, 2017, our wholly owned subsidiary, School TV entered into a RE/MAX Regional Franchise Agreement with the master franchisor of RE/MAX Japan, Kidding Co., to lease the franchise rights to two Japanese Prefectures, Kanagawa and Okinawa, in consideration of 75,060,000 JPY (674,333 USD) effective on July 7, 2017. Both lease terms are for a term of fifteen years and, after expiration of the lease term, School TV will need to pay to renew its rights to franchise RE/MAX should the Company decide to do so at that time. (*1, *2)
 
As depicted in the chart above, School TV has leased the rights to be regional franchisor owner of RE/MAX brokerage offices in two Prefectures (regions) of Japan from Kidding Co. Kidding Co. is the managing company for all of Japan’s RE/MAX operations. School TV is not engaged in any real estate activities and any brokerage offices opened up in these prefectures under School TV will be Japanese real estate companies with the proper licenses to carry out real estate sales and activities.
 
Currently, there is no brokerage office in either of these Prefectures and we have not yet generated any income relating to these activities. School TV is actively searching for real estate companies which will agree to open up, own and run RE/MAX broker offices for each region. However, any and all plans regarding the identification of an appropriate and interested real estate company remain speculative in nature and are still under development. (*3)
 
Tokyo region
 
*In relation to the below operations we have not yet generated any income.
 
On July 28, 2017, School TV entered into an Agreement with Investech Co. whereas it is agreed that School TV will provide monetary support to Investech Co., a Japanese Company, which operates a real estate brokerage office of RE/MAX Japan in the Tokyo region (the “Investech Agreement”). (*4)
 
On July 28, 2017, School TV entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Kidding Co., pursuant to which Kidding Co. consents for School TV to provide monetary support to Investech Co., a Japanese Company, which operates a regional branch of RE/MAX Japan in the Tokyo region (further details can be found in the agreement titled “Kidding MOU”).
 
The Tokyo region has the largest real estate market in Japan. However, there is currently no regional owner in the Tokyo area. As such, Kidding Co. currently conducts management of the RE/MAX location in Tokyo, Japan.
 
School TV cannot, at this time, open and/or own a real estate brokerage office pursuant to Japanese regulations. However, they are not forbidden from providing monetary support to such brokerage offices in exchange for a percentage of profits from the brokerage offices. At present, School TV provides monetary support to Investech Co., the owner and operator of the RE/MAX brokerage office located in Tokyo. Currently, Investech Co. has three sales agents.
 
E-Learning Laboratory Co., Ltd (the controlling shareholder of Exceed World, Inc.) intends to provide sales agents to Investech Co. in order to identify potential parties interested in purchasing real estate. Such sales agents will not be directly involved in the sale of any real estate, and their sole purpose is to identify a potential real estate purchaser for Investech to contact and pursue sales efforts. Pursuant to School TV’s relationship with Investech, Co., School TV receives a share of any profits generated from the RE/MAX profits in Tokyo through profit sharing. In the event that a sale is consummated resulting from the efforts of e-Learning Laboratory Co.’s sales agents, then 20% of Investech’s profits for the transaction go to the sales agent, and an additional 24% of the profits are paid to School TV. In any other scenario, that does not include a sales agent from e-Learning Laboratory Co., Ltd, in which Investech generates revenue from the operations of their RE/MAX location then School TV receives 5% of Investech’s profits.
 
Note: e-Learning Laboratory Co., Ltd and School TV do not have a formal agreement pursuant to their sales agents or profit sharing at this point in time.
 
From time to time Kidding Co., may pay fees to School TV to cover some or all of the monetary support given to Investech Co., by School TV.
 
(*5) Ikezoe Trust owns Kidding Co., referred to in the chart as “Kidding”.


Competition - RE/MAX Business
 
Our primary competition comes from established real estate companies within Japan, but can also include global companies who offer their products/services within Japan. Some of our competitors have larger resources than we have, a longer operating history, and established connections throughout our target regions, which may make it difficult to penetrate into the market effectively and find a real estate company to operate in Kanagawa or Okinawa. Even if we do manage to penetrate into the market there can be no guarantee that we will be able to continue to effectively compete with established competitors in an effective manner.
Employees
 
We have a total of 4 employees, one of which is our sole officer and director, Tomoo Yoshida. Our employees are also involved in the operations of our wholly owned subsidiary, School TV.
