Our Business
 
Tautachrome operates in the internet applications space, a large space we believe to be uniquely able to make possible fast growing and novel business. The iPhone, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Android, Uber and numerous other examples are reminders of the ability of the internet applications space to surprise us with new business universes out of nowhere. A recent surprise was the arrival in the internet applications space of blockchain technology, which is empowering enterprises of all sizes to create ecosystems of trade based on self-introduced and globally useable cryptocurrencies. The arrival of blockchain technology has added a significant new and leading element to Tautachrome’s business plans and activities. 
 
Tautachrome is currently pursuing two main avenues of business activity based on our patented imaging technology (branded “KlickZie” technology):
 


1. | KlickZie’s blockchain cryptocurrency based ecosystem: our recently added activity to create our own KlickZie blockchain and cryptocurrency to incentivize user download of KlickZie products and to provide a crypto based monetary stream to the Company, and

2. | KlickZie technology-based business: our longstanding flagship activity to develop and monetize downloadable apps based on our patented KlickZie trusted imaging technology and based on our patented trusted image-based social interactions using the pictures and videos that smartphone users generate on the web using their KlickZie imaging app.

1. KlickZie blockchain cryptocurrency based ecosystem
 
In September 2017 we formed a development team of providers to develop a KlickZie blockchain (branded the “zChain”) to handle the transactions on a cryptocurrency ecosystem with a cryptotoken designated “KLK.” The KLK cryptotoken is intended to be the currency of the imagery trading ecosystem allowing KlickZie users to monetize their pictures and videos and thereby enabling ability for widescale buying, selling and licensing of KlickZie pictures and videos. 
 
The development team that was formed, consists of individuals from the blockchain development company Kelecorix, Inc., and individuals from the image storage company Honeycomb Digital, LLC. The team is developing the software and architecture for the implementation of a simple KlickZie app that seek to implement the ownership properties of KlickZie imaging, which coupled with the blockchain-based ownership of KLK cryptotokens, could then be used to trade and license image ownership. 
 
A monetizing ecosystem for the KlickZie app user aims to provide value to KlickZie users as well as to the Company and its shareholders.
 
Like other blockchains, the zChain is intended to run in a decentralized manner without any management or oversight. Its utility to KlickZie app users would come from “smart contracts” residing on the zChain implementing the buying, selling licensing and other trading features on the zChain. Its utility to the Company would come from two sources. The first is a commission on zChain smart contract transactions that involve participation by the Company to complete (for instance the certification of the validity of KlickZie imagery when requested). The second is the use of KLK tokens to provide incentives for smartphone users to download and use the KlickZie app with the aim of encouraging a rapid growth in the KlickZie userbase. 
 
With the KLK token in place we seek to provide a new value to the KlickZie app user through the transfer of additional wealth to the user. Because KlickZie users own the imagery they create, its use by others, including advertises wishing to engage with them, could do so through the execution of a smart contract on the zChain transferring KLK currency from the advertiser to the user in exchange for the receipt of advertising imagery from the advertiser. 
 
2. KlickZie technology-based business activity
 
Tautachrome’s KlickZie technology addresses two features of the internet age that create a new need and a new opportunity. The first is the need for a way to trust the pictures and videos you see on the web. Right now the trillions of pictures and frames of video on the web are so easily and often falsified that trustability of internet imagery is essentially zero. For this reason we believe that a universally available, downloadable system that turns the everyday pictures and videos we take from our smartphones into imagery that can be completely trustable to any third party seeing it, will have substantial value . With such a system two kinds of imagery will exist on the web: On the one hand imagery whose trustworthiness everybody can be certain of, and on the other hand all the rest of the imagery for which the notion of trust is meaningless. The KlickZie system aims to satisfy the requirement of for universal trustability for the ordinary imagery it produces.
 
The technology required for trustability also opens the door to a new opportunity. This is the opportunity to enable people to use KlickZie pictures and videos on the web to readily and safely interact with each other via the imagery itself. It is frequently the case that when you run across interesting imagery on the web you cannot know anything about it, including who the author is, who else may have seen it, or what others may think or know about it. By allowing people to interact with interesting or important pictures or videos by using the imagery itself as the portal of communication, the KlickZie system can add the viewpoints and the information offerings of interacting people to the richness of the pictures and videos. This can be carried by the system into the future along with the imagery, as an evolving information structure of interaction and imagery.

How KlickZie technology is intended to work: The KlickZie Activation Platform
 
Users will download KlickZie’s free software into their mobile device (iPhone, Android or other smartphone). The software, an upgrade to the smartphone’s camera software, will activate the pictures and videos taken by their device using proprietary KlickZie marking technology. Behind the scenes, KlickZie will capture the imagery and available metadata related to the imaging event, and mark the imagery and its metadata with advanced and invisible KlickZie marking technology.
 
KlickZie Activation 
 
KlickZie activation seeks to add a new utility to ordinary pictures and videos. Other KlickZie users who come across an activated picture can communicate with the author of the picture, or with amenable others who have seen the picture or with the data stored in the picture by clicking or touching the picture (“touch-to-comm”). We intend the picture itself by click or touch to make the communication happen no matter where or how you come across an activated picture..
 
What happens to an activated picture from its creation onward is intended to be added to the picture’s data for tracking into the future. Activated pictures seek to answer many questions. For example, in a group photo you could ask: Have any of the people in my contacts list interacted with this picture? Are any of them engaging it right now? Who else besides my contacts have already engaged this picture in some way? Who took it? Where? When? 
 
The upshot is that activation seeks to allow effective touch to comm with the authors and viewers of smartphone pictures and videos from every source, and to ensure that activated pictures and videos can be completely trusted imagery.
 
KlickZie Product Rollout
 
Rolling out KlickZie requires hiring activity to round out the KlickZie Technical Team. Additional required technical staff will include: cloud architects, database engineers, image processing engineers, full stack software engineers, steganography software developers, app development software engineers, and smartphone code defense software engineers. 

· | Phase 1: Build the minimal testable KlickZie system –including the smartphone imaging engine and the service cloud (Rev 1 KlickZie system), identifying and fixing functionality deficiencies and user experience and interface hiccups, building a loyal base of early adopters and defining Rev 2. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Phase 2: Build and release Rev 2 into a limited audience to optimize user experience and user interfaces, to define, build, test and finalize viral growth methodology, to finalize the smartphone imaging engine, to test/finalize the cloud subsystem for global scale up, to build a seed population of up to 200,000 contented users, and to plan global rollout.
· | Phase 3: Roll out KlickZie system globally, culture by culture and language by language, adding support staff and services as rollout moves forward.

Monetizing
 
As presently conceived, the KlickZie product aims at revenues from four primary sources:
 


· | Advertising Using pictures and videos as portals of communication allows the presentation of these communications in a framework of the Company’s choice, enabling advertisers to place paid ads within this framework. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | User premium service fees KlickZie is intended to be free to consumers. Since KlickZie is handling user imagery and user imagery-based communications, opportunities for users to gain extra KlickZie service are intended to be provided for fee-based premium user memberships. 
· | App Developer Revenue As conceived, the KlickZie imaging engine is a powerful tool for generating trustable imagery. The KlickZie cloud is intended to allow developers access to this powerful engine along with KlickZie-provided developer tools enabling them to develop apps of their own invention, access being granted under a revenue sharing arrangement.
· | Enterprise Revenue Because as conceived the KlickZie imaging engine could be a powerful tool for generating trustable imagery, it could support the needs of business and industrial enterprises for which trustable imagery from employees, customers or partners is mission critical. We plan to license our engine to enterprises on a license fee basis. 

Funding
 
The KlickZie product rollout requires substantial funding. We plan on, and are now, seeking funds to finance KlickZie product rollout.
 
The Company intends to offer its KLK cryptotokens to the public in an offering to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, for the purpose of raising up to $100 million in proceeds to further develop our KlickZie trusted imaging technology and our KlickZie high speed zChain blockchain in support of a KLK-based crypto transaction ecosystem. The Company currently plans to effect the proposed offering through a KLK token website managed by the Company. At present, purchases on the KLK token website will be paid for in Ethereum’s “ether” cryptocoins.
 
The proposed offering will take place as soon as practicable upon effectiveness of a registration statement to be filed with the SEC. We can give no assurance that the registration statement will ever be effective or that the proposed offering will take place as anticipated or at all. 
 
This disclosure does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor will there be any offer, solicitation or sale of securities, in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any state or jurisdiction
 
In addition, financing may be accomplished by incurring debt, by equity sale or through other means. There can be no assurances given that any of our funding efforts will be successful. 
 
First KlickZie revenues
 
Apart from Company revenues from the sale its KLK cryptotokens to the public as disclosed in the section above, our Plan of Operations for KlickZie based revenue is prepared for first revenues from enterprise users coming on line within the first year after the receipt of funding sufficient to round out the KlickZie team. Preparations for other KlickZie revenue are geared for the two year and out timeframe. 
 
Shelved business activity
 
General app development and digital design activities that were being carried out under our wholly-owned Polybia Studios subsidiary, and our acquisition activities that were being carried out under our Appquisitions Division have been shelved for the time being.

Polybia Studios
 
Polybia Studios, Pty LTD, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tautachrome. During 2016, Polybia was staffed with technology graduates of Bond University in Queensland, Australia and operated out of Mermaid Beach, Queensland, Australia. Polybia provided IT support to the Company which included the development of the Company’s websites, the development of the internal software systems, database servers and branding for the Company’s SafeDate App, and for the technical support of the Company’s Appquisitions Division formed in 2016 and of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, PhotoSweep, LLC purchased in 2016.
 
Subsequent to December 31, 2017, all development and support functions formerly performed by Polybia Studios in Australia have been transferred to and are being performed in the United States.
 
PhotoSweep
 
PhotoSweep, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company located in Oro Valley, Arizona whose single asset is a halted smartphone app named PhotoSweep that requires rework to be relaunched. The Company is currently reviewing the utility of a rework and relaunch of the app. 
 
Competition 
 
With regard to the internet applications in general, competition is intense. For example, according to Statista by mid-2015 there were more than three million different smartphone applications available to users. We think it is likely that this number has only increased since then. In spaces that are this crowded the principal matter of competition is about capturing user mind space, which for a given product consists of elements such as degree of product exposure to users, degree of product apparent desirability, pleasure of product usage, and persisting necessity for the product in a user’s life. These elements of competition are well known to our competitors which include the internet giants Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, all of whom have financial resources and operating staffs substantially larger than those of the Company, and all of whom can focus on the optimization of their products towards the same consumer and business arenas upon which we intend to focus.
 
With regard to KlickZie’s technology for marking, storing and tracking digital imagery, there are many firms who mark, store and track digital imagery. Among these are Digimarc, BatchPhoto, and hirdlight who market such processes for purposes of protecting intellectual property. To our knowledge none of these is turning the smartphone into a generally trustable imager or advanced image-based communicator as envisioned here, which requires substantially more talent and development activity than required for marking, storing and tracking digital imagery. However, there is nothing stopping any firm, particularly the internet giants, from entering into similar activity. Moreover Truepic has entered the arena of smartphone trusted imagery with patented technology. We have reviewed Truepic’s patent claims and believe that our planned applications will not infringe their claims.
