Original Strategy and Recent Business



Since 2012, the Company has focused on marketing, developing and acquiring technologies designed to improve the environment by reducing pollution. The Company has acquired technologies, patents and intellectual property from EnviroTechnologies Inc. through share transfer, assignment and representation agreements entered into during 2012 and 2013. Following those acquisitions, management has expanded the registration of intellectual property rights around the world and pursued opportunities globally for the development and marketing of the emission control technologies.



Working with a worldwide network of agents to market the ENVI-Systems™ emission control technologies, the Company has focused on three applications of the technology:



ENVI-Marine TM



Diesel exhaust from ships, ferries and tankers includes ash and soot as particulate components and sulfur dioxide as an acid gas. Testing has been conducted on diesel shipping to confirm the application of seawater as a neutralizing agent for sulfur emissions as well as capturing particulate matter. In addition to marine applications, these tests also showed applicability of the system for large displacement engines such as stationary generators, compressors, container handling, heavy construction and mining equipment.



ENVI-Pure TM



Increasing legislation relating to landfill of municipal solid waste has led to the emergence of increasing numbers of waste to energy plants (“WtE”). A WtE plant obviates the need for landfill, burning municipal waste for conversion to electricity. A WtE plant is typically 45-100MW. The ENVI-Clean™ system is particularly suited to WtE as it cleans multiple pollutants in a single system.



ENVI-Clean TM



EnviroTechnologies Inc. has successfully conducted sulfur dioxide demonstration tests at the American Bituminous Coal Partners power plant in Grant Town, West Virginia. The testing achieved a three test average of 99.3% removal efficiency. The implementation of US Clean Air regulations in July 2010 has created additional demand for sulfur dioxide removal in all industries emitting sulfur pollution. Furthermore, China consumes approximately one half of the world’s coal, but introduced measures designed to reduce energy and carbon intensity in its 12th Five Year Plan. Applications include regional power facilities and heating for commercial buildings and greenhouses. Typical applications range in size from 1 to 20 megawatts (MW) with power generation occupying the larger end of the range. The ENVI-Clean™ system removes most of the sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, greenhouse gases and other hazardous air pollutants from the flue gases produced by the combustion of coal, biomass, municipal solid waste, diesel and other fuels.



Vision & Strategy



Pacific Green envisions a world of rapidly growing demand for renewable energy technological solutions to address the challenges presented by a changing climate. Having achieved success in marine emission control technologies we have now diversified our business to provide turnkey and scalable end-to-end environmental and renewable technology solutions in the energy sector. Our technological platform now has three main divisions:

● | Emission Control Systems (“ECS”);
--+----------------------------------


● | Concentrated Solar Power (“CSP”); and
--+--------------------------------------


● | Battery Energy Storage Systems (“BESS”);
--+-----------------------------------------

In all the above areas, Pacific Green plans to execute this vision by a dual strategy of equipment sales and proactive infrastructure development and ownership, each is led by acquisitions of technology capabilities and project investment opportunities, highlighted to date by the following events:




● | on December 20, 2019, the Company closed the acquisition of Shanghai Engin Digital Technology Co. Ltd. (“Engin”) a solar design, development and engineering company. Engin is a design and engineering business focused primarily on CSP, desalination and waste to energy technologies. Engin’s CSP reference plants in China comprise over 150MW and we are now in talks to provide CSP alongside future ammonia and hydrogen production facilities in Asia and South America;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | on October 20, 2020, the Company closed the acquisition of Innoergy Limited (“Innoergy”), a UK based designer of BESS whose clients included Osaka Gas Co. Ltd, in Japan, and Limejump Limited in the UK, a subsidiary of Shell plc. The acquisition underpins our entry into the BESS market; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | on March 18, 2021, the Company acquired Richborough Energy Park Limited (“Richborough”), a BESS development project to deliver 100MW of energy in Kent, UK.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In support of this dual strategy, we have adopted a Human Resource Strategy that seeks to hire the best talent in the core areas of our business. At March 31, 2022, the Company employed approximately 53 staff excluding full time consultants and contractors across a network of offices around the world. Our hiring plan includes the addition of sales and project execution specialists.



Strategic Partnerships



Pacific Green has forged global partnerships with private and state-owned energy providers and owners. This strategic alignment with leading energy industry platforms empowers Pacific Green to provide quickly scalable solutions in the core areas of our business, to gather unique insights on cutting-edge trends and leverage recurring revenue opportunities that enable us to cross-sell products and services.



The Company has entered into several partnership and framework agreements in the core areas of our business.
