ITEM 1:       BUSINESS
Company Overview
Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Incorporated (“Ritchie Bros.”, the “Company”, “we”, or “us”) (NYSE & TSX: RBA) was founded in 1958 in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada and is a world leader in asset management and disposition technologies for commercial assets, selling $5.5 billion of used equipment and other assets during 2021. Our expertise, unprecedented global reach, market insights, and trusted portfolio of brands provide us with a unique position within the used equipment market.
Through our unreserved auctions, online marketplaces, listings, and private brokerage services, we sell a broad range of primarily used commercial and industrial assets as well as government surplus. Construction and transportation assets comprise the majority of the equipment sold by GTV dollar value. Customers selling equipment through our sales channels include end users (such as construction companies), equipment dealers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and other equipment owners (such as rental companies). Our customers participate in a variety of sectors, including construction, transportation, agriculture, energy, and natural resources. 
We also provide our customers with a wide array of value added services aligned with our growth strategy to create a global marketplace for used equipment services and solutions. Our other services include equipment financing, asset appraisals and inspections, online equipment listing, logistical services, and ancillary services such as equipment refurbishment. We offer our customers asset technology solutions to manage the end to end disposition process of their assets and provide market data intelligence to make more accurate and reliable business decisions. Additionally, we offer our customers an innovative technology platform that supports equipment lifecycle management and parts procurement integration with both original equipment manufacturers and dealers, as well as software as a service platform for end-to-end parts procurement and digital catalogs and diagrams. 
We operate globally with locations in 12 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Netherlands, and maintain a presence in 48 countries where customers are able to sell from their own yards. In addition, we employ more than 2,700 full-time employees worldwide. 
Acquisition of SmartEquip
​
On November 2, 2021, we completed the acquisition of SmartEquip, a Delaware, United States corporation. SmartEquip has a multi-manufacturer platform that provides customers with real-time service and diagnostic support, dynamically customized, via serial number, to each asset in their fleet, and enables the electronic procurement of parts from original equipment manufacturers and their dealers. We acquired SmartEquip for a purchase price of $174 million. We also issued 63,971 common shares valued at $4.4 million, to certain continuing employees subject to their continuing employment over a three year vesting period from the date of acquisition. 
​
We expect that the acquisition of SmartEquip will enable and accelerate adoption of parts and service sales on behalf of our dealer and OEM partners by providing a seamless experience for end users, will deepen our inventory management system connectivity and will further enable digital solutions at scale around inspections and ancillary services while enabling better optimization of search and advertising revenue streams. The acquisition further aligns to our execution strategy of becoming a trusted global marketplace for insights, services and transaction solutions for commercial assets. SmartEquip will continue to maintain its physical presence in Connecticut, United States for the foreseeable future.
​
Acquisition of Euro Auctions 
​
On August 9, 2021, we entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase Euro Auctions Limited, William Keys & Sons Holdings Limited, Equipment & Plant Services Ltd, and Equipment Sales Ltd. (collectively, “Euro Auctions”), each being a private limited company incorporated in Northern Ireland (the “Euro Auctions Acquisition”), for a purchase price of approximately £775 million (approximately $1.05 billion) in cash, to be paid on closing.
​
Founded in 1998, Euro Auctions conducts unreserved heavy equipment auctions with on site and online bidding under the brands Euro Auctions and Yoder & Frey, and employs over 200 employees in 14 countries. Similar to Ritchie Bros., Euro Auctions also sells items through a timed auction format and a daily marketplace with Buy Now and Make Offer options.
​

​



The acquisition of Euro Auctions is aligned with our accelerated growth efforts and with our strategy as stated above. Euro Auctions will enhance our international presence and accelerate our international growth by offering diversified choice to customers around the world, facilitate better price discovery and more equipment selection. We will expand our overall footprint to access equipment, while also tapping into new revenue streams with service offerings to Euro Auctions customers, including inventory management services, data solution, financing, warranty, insurance, inspections, refurbishing, shipping, and more. We plan to retain the Euro Auctions employees and its brand, both of which are highly regarded in the Europe, the Middle East, and Africa regions. In addition, we anticipate both companies will achieve synergy by unlocking value for Euro Auctions customers post acquisition through adoption of our inventory management system platform.
​
On December 21, 2021, the Company completed its offering of two series of senior unsecured notes for approximately $935.0 million aggregate principal. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the two series of senior unsecured notes, together with proceeds from our delayed-draw term loan and, on an as-needed basis, cash on hand available or borrowings under our revolving facilities to fund the consideration payable of the acquisition of Euro Auctions. The gross proceeds from the offering will be held in escrow pending the consummation of the acquisition of Euro Auctions. On December 23, 2021, the Company entered into two deal contingent foreign exchange forward currency contracts, with no upfront cash cost, to manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations against the U.S. and Canadian dollar on £343.0 million of the £775.0 million purchase consideration for the proposed Euro Auctions Acquisition.
​
Impact of COVID-19 to our Business 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, which quickly spread throughout the world, resulting in significant global economic disruption that has materially impacted several countries and regions in which we operate, including the United States, Canada, Europe, the Middle East, Australia and Asia. It has resulted in travel restrictions, economic uncertainty, and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas and has negatively disrupted global manufacturing and workforce participation, including our own. 
In 2021, our ability to move equipment to and from our auction sites and across borders varied across regions, with Asia and Australia particularly impacted, as regional governments enforced heavy travel restrictions and quarantine requirements. In these regions, the restrictions also resulted in some challenges in customer interactions and challenges for our customers to complete equipment inspections. In the United States and Canada, COVID-19 did not materially impact our ability to operate our businesses and move equipment. Globally, we continued to see surges in shipping and freight costs combined with extended lead times, making transportation of equipment both more costly and more challenging, negatively impacting the buying and selling behaviours of our customers. Additionally, COVID-19 in combination with various macro economic factors impacted the supply chains of new equipment production, which in turn negatively affected the supply of used equipment being sold throughout our regions, most predominantly in North America. 
​
Our top priority regarding COVID-19 remains the health and welfare of our employees, customers, suppliers and others with whom we partner to run our business activities. We continue to adhere to all local government and jurisdictional safety guidelines, and, in some instances, we are applying additional over-and-above safety measures. Many of our employees continue to work from home on a temporary basis and travel continues to be limited given ongoing travel restrictions. 
​
Since the beginning of COVID-19, we continue to be able to operate and serve our customers’ equipment and immediate liquidity needs through our platform of auction technology solutions and online auction capabilities. In addition to running our IronPlanet weekly featured online auction, our online Marketplace-E solution and our GovPlanet online auctions, we modified our operations in March 2020 to transition all of our traditional live on site industrial auctions and events to online bidding. Buyers are generally still able to visit our auction sites in advance of the auctions to conduct inspections and pick up equipment post auction, but we have generally not been holding live auction events in our theatres. As restrictions continue to ease in the US and elsewhere, we will consider a further transition back to some measure of in-person attendance at certain of our on site auction events. 
The extent of the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives, will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic in light of new variants, and any related restrictions implemented by governments in various jurisdictions, as well as supply and demand impacts driven by our consignor and buyer base, all of which are uncertain and cannot be easily predicted. Although at the time of this filing, we continue to operate our auctions in all regions, there is no assurance that our operations could not be impacted in the future. 

​

​



We continue to actively monitor the evolving impact that COVID-19 is having in the world and remain ready to take further actions or adjust our response based on any new governmental guidance or recommendations. It is unknown how long the pandemic will last, or whether we will see a resurgence of cases as new variants develop or spread, how many people are ultimately going to be affected by it, and the long-term implications to local or global economies. Equally, the effects of COVID-19 on equipment supply, buyer demand, and potential pricing volatility, or the potential impact on our buyers’ continued ability to pay or secure financing remain uncertain. Additionally, there is a level of uncertainty about the long-term impact of COVID-19 on our third party vendors, partners and the service providers with whom we currently do business. As such, given the ongoing nature of COVID-19, we are not currently able to reasonably estimate the future impacts of COVID-19 on our business operations, results of operations, cash flows, financial performance or our ability to pay dividends. 
​
Strategy
Our strategy to become the trusted global marketplace for insights, services and transaction solutions for commercial assets will help us address the large and fragmented used equipment marketplace that we operate in today. We believe our strategy will help us unlock significant growth opportunities by building on Ritchie Bros.’ core business and expanding into additional services. We are building on our position as a trusted advisor to our customers by evolving from transactional selling to meeting the needs of our customers through solution selling.
We see significant growth opportunities ahead by becoming the trusted global marketplace for insights, services, and transaction solutions for commercial assets. This represents not a shift, but an expansion of our transaction solutions that we are already well known for. We value our long-tenured relationships with our customers, and the trust they have in our brand and platform. We are leveraging our sales channels to create a global marketplace for services and solutions that help our customers gain the insights they need to make decisions and run their businesses. We also intend to offer complimentary third party services on our platform where it will help our customers.
This strategy is supported by five strategic pillars on which we will build our future success:


​

Ritchie Bros. | 5

​



Customer Experience - At Ritchie Bros., we have a long history, culture and passion for helping our customers. We continue to find ways to enrich our customers’ experience by making our processes easier, our offerings more complete and our brands simpler.
Employee Experience - We cannot deliver a great customer experience without great employees. We continue to strive to create the best workplace for all employees and to create a place where they want to build a career. We encourage open and honest dialogue and are committed to robust communications from management to employees and creating channels for them to give feedback, as well as fixing processes and technology to improve the work environment for the benefit of both customers and employees.
Modern Architecture - We are transitioning to a modern architecture based in the cloud and comprised of microservices that allow us to create a single presence for our customers across all of our solutions. A modern architecture will allow flexibility and agility to enable scalable growth for us, our customers, and our partners. 
Inventory Management System - We see our Inventory Management System, which integrates and tracks inventory data for selected customers, as a gateway for our customers to access our marketplaces and services. With the data, we can offer more timely and proactive advice and solutions to our customers with more ease of use.
Accelerate growth – We continually seek to identify areas to pilot improved business processes to positively impact the customer experience. We look to accelerate growth by scaling the learnings from these pilots into our global operations.
We believe our strategy of becoming the global trusted marketplace for commercial assets will allow us to better serve our customers and will facilitate better penetration into non-auction markets and associated services. Building an integrated, easy to use marketplace, and becoming the trusted advisor to our customers opens significant potential for our business. We will start, as always, with our customers and our partners, and make sure we are building what they need.
Service Offerings
We offer our equipment buyer and seller customers multiple distinct, complementary, multi-channel brand solutions that address the range of their needs. Our global customer base has a variety of transaction options, breadth of services, and the widest selection of used equipment available to them.

Gross Transaction Value (“GTV”)
We record GTV for our A&M business, which represents total proceeds from all items sold at our auctions and online marketplaces. GTV is not a measure of financial performance, liquidity, or revenue, and is not presented in our consolidated financial statements.
​
​
Contract options
We offer consignors several contract options to meet their individual needs and sale objectives. Through our A&M business, options include:

● | Straight commission contracts, where the consignor receives the gross proceeds from the sale less a pre-negotiated commission rate;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Guarantee contracts, where the consignor receives a guaranteed minimum amount plus an additional amount if proceeds exceed a specified level; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Inventory contracts, where we purchase, take custody, and hold used equipment and other assets before they are resold in the ordinary course of business.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We collectively refer to guarantee and inventory contracts as underwritten or “at-risk” contracts. In 2021, our underwritten business accounted for approximately 18% of our GTV, compared to 20% in 2020 and 2019.
Value-added services
We also provide a wide array of value-added services to make the process of selling and buying equipment convenient for our customers. In addition to the other services listed in the table below, we also provide the following value-added services to our customers:

​
Intellectual Property 
We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in marketing our organization, services, and website, as well as differentiating us from our competitors. We own or hold the rights to use valuable intellectual property such as trademarks, service marks, domain names and tradenames. We protect our intellectual property in Canada, the U.S., and internationally through federal, provincial, state, and common law rights, including registration of certain trademark and service marks for many of our brands, including our core brands. We also have secured patents for inventions and have registered our domain names.
​
We rely on contractual restrictions and rights to protect certain of our proprietary rights in products and services. Effective protection of our intellectual property can be expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in many jurisdictions throughout the world. In addition, we may, from time to time, be subject to intellectual property claims, including allegations of infringement, which can be costly to defend. For a discussion of the risks involved with intellectual property litigation and enforcement of our intellectual property rights, see the related information in “Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Competition
Competition Overview
The global used equipment market is highly fragmented with total annual global used equipment volumes estimated at more than $300.0 billion. We estimate the used equipment auction segment is $30 billion. Ritchie Bros. is the largest auction company with approximately $5.5 billion in GTV volume in 2021. We compete based on breadth, brand reputation, security, technology, and global reach of our services, as well as in the variety of contracts and methods and channels of selling equipment. In addition to the auction segment, two other major segments include private sales and brokers as well as the retail segment which includes OEMs, OEM dealers, rental companies and large strategic accounts. We also compete with private sales – often securing new business from equipment owners who had previously tried selling their equipment privately. Given the fragmentation in the auction market as well as upstream opportunities in private sales and retail, there is significant opportunity for growth.

Competitive advantages 
Our key strengths provide distinct competitive advantages and have enabled us to achieve significant and profitable growth over the long term.
Global platform
We pride ourselves on our ability to connect buyers and sellers through our digital channels as well as a global network of over 40 auction sites in 12 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Netherlands. Our online bidding technology and Ritchie Bros. website are currently available in 10 and 22 languages, respectively. Our global presence allows us to generate deep pools of liquidity for transactions enabling global market pricing for our equipment sellers, helping to deliver strong and efficient price realization for assets.
Customer Relationships
Relationships are the core of Ritchie Bros. – delighting customers and treating them like friends while meeting their business needs. By offering an unprecedented choice of solutions that best suit our customers’ needs, making their lives easier in the process, we develop relationships that can last across generations. We take a long-term approach with our customers and as such we position our sales force to act as trusted advisors to our customers.
Breadth of solutions 
Our platform provides us with the ability to meet all the buyers’ and sellers’ unique needs in a one-stop-shop manner. By delivering choice through our disposition channels, we can work with customers as a trusted advisor to provide them each with a tailored suite of equipment disposition solutions and asset management capabilities to best meet their needs.
In addition to transaction solutions, Ritchie Bros. offers a variety of value-added services to our customers including financial services, market data, valuation insights, inspections, appraisals, transportations, refurbishment and digital parts procurement.
​
Delivering Insights and Services through Data & Analytics
​
A core part of the Ritchie Bros.’ strategy is delivering insights and services through rich data and analytics. Based on the world’s largest used equipment transaction dataset, we provide data products that allow customers to analyze market dynamics and value assets. Additionally, Rouse Services is the leading provider of rental metrics benchmarks and equipment valuations to lenders, rental companies, contractors and dealers. Rouse’s business model is built upon an extensive data ecosystem, proprietary analytics and Data Science techniques, and trusted customer relationships rooted in service and confidentiality.
We continue to invest in data science to deliver asset value predictions, generate user leads, prioritize marketing investments, interpret price trends and more. Proprietary algorithmic asset pricing is used internally to set target values and optimize marketplace operations and externally to provide users of Ritchie Bros. Asset Solutions with instant asset values on inventory. The monthly Ritchie Bros. Used Equipment Market Trends Summary report features our proprietary use of Machine Learning to provide Mix-Adjusted Price Indexes for core asset groups around the globe. Correlated with other leading economic indicators, these price indexes have been quickly adopted by customers, analysts, and manufacturers as a key insight into pricing trends. Machine learning also supports important strategic and operational decisions such as site expansion, testing marketplace performance, and experimentation with improved formats. 
​
Our People 
​
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 2,700 full-time employees (up 7.9% from 2020) and 1,600 part time employees worldwide, representing approximately 64% and 36%, respectively, of our global workforce. We also periodically hire contractors as needed to support our auctions, various businesses, and other projects. In November 2021, with the acquisition of SmartEquip, we welcomed 71 additional full-time employees.
​

​

​ | 
--------------+--
Ritchie Bros. | 9

​



Of our total full-time employees, 950 people work locally in the field to support our global auction operations (2020: 867) and 394 people are focused on sales and solutions for our customers (2020: 425). In 2021, keeping our employees and customers safe remained top of mind and our daily practices supported this mission. We set up flexible work arrangement guidelines that provided support to our employees and leaders and continued to serve our customers while maintaining our remote work arrangements.
​
Development and Engagement
We believe that our people are our greatest asset and that engaged employees are paramount to the health and success of our business. We invest in a variety of training, development and engagement practices to deliver on our growth agenda and create more leaders. 
In 2021, we invested $1.7 million in employee development (2020: $1.7 million). All full-time employees are encouraged to have development plans that focus on functional and career growth. We provide all our employees access to instructor-led courses as well as a library of over 3000 online courses, videos, books, and resources for ongoing personal, functional, and professional growth. In addition, our Tuition Reimbursement program provides tuition assistance to eligible employees for professional development courses outside of the organization. In response to COVID-19, we have curated tools and resources and developed training programs to provide our leaders and employees with the skills to successfully work remotely and manage the challenges in these uncertain times. We checked in with our employees through pulse surveys and communicated through distribution of a twice-weekly newsletter named #RitchieStrong. Our newsletter, which comes directly from our CEO to all of our employees, promotes our successes, highlights our people and encourages social distancing and safety practices. Each newsletter ends with a reminder that employees can raise comments and ask questions directly to our CEO via email.
​
During 2021, we achieved the following objectives to strengthen the development and engagement of our people:
​

I. | Rolled out PRINT®, a human motivation model, to our people-leaders to gain insights on what drives them so that they can operate at their highest level. 50% of our leaders completed the PRINT® assessment and training;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


II. | Initiated the 360° Leadership Feedback program, for employees to receive feedback on how their manager, colleagues, and direct reports perceive their effectiveness as a leader;
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


III. | Shifted to quarterly performance conversations to drive performance and engagement and simplified the year-end review process by removing performance ratings to allow for more meaningful conversations about accomplishments, values and opportunities; and
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IV. | Invited our full-time employees to help assess the effectiveness of their leaders and identify areas of development through a My Leader Pulse Survey; of the 57% who responded, almost all communicated favorably about the effectiveness of their leaders.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We continue to look for ways to create on the-job learning opportunities so that our employees feel invested and engaged. Employees are involved in strategic initiatives and finding ways to better serve our customers and each other.
One of our key objectives and priorities is to drive employee candidate experiences. In 2021, the Company was ranked 2nd out of 132 participating companies and 1st of 65 global in North America in the Annual Talent Board Candidate Experience Awards, which recognizes companies that provide the best candidate experience. This is our first time winning this award on Best Candidate Experience of its kind.

​



Health & Safety
Our objective is to keep our people healthy and safe – to send everyone home, every day, the way they came to work.
​
All new employees are required to complete a safety orientation training that captures our health and safety programs, our policy statement and provides an overview of our global Employee Health and Safety (“EHS”) policies and expectations. Our 2021 completion rate for the safety orientation program was 98% (2020: 97.4%).
​
We also have a risk management process to support our safety orientation programs and our health and safety commitment which ensures that our employees are exposed to the lowest possible level of risk. Our risk management process begins with an annual review of all incidents from the prior year to identify trends to see if we need to address findings through changes in our policies and procedures. 
Daily, our employees conduct either a field level hazard assessment or complete a risk identification card to identify risks relating to the performance of their roles. These risk identification cards are monitored by our yard managers and/or our regional operations managers and corrective actions are taken to ensure that the risk is reduced or eliminated. During 2021 we had over 14,000 (2020: 10,000) risk identification cards completed by our staff.
We also conduct annual online safety training with employees who perform certain operational tasks. In 2021 our completion rate for this training was over 98.5% (2020: 98%). Additionally, in 2021 managers at our sites were also required to complete a series of online courses as part of their professional development. In 2021 we had a completion rate of over 94.5% (2020: 95%).
​
We also measure our Total Recordable Injury Rate (“TRIR”) which measures the number of reportable incidences per 100 full-time workers during the year. Our annual TRIR goal is to meet or do better by being below the industrial average. TRIR for 2021 was 1.38, which was below the industrial average.

Every region within our organization also has a Safety Steering team that provides feedback on our safety journey and assists in identifying issues or concerns that may arise. Our success in health and safety relies on everyone taking an active role in the development and implementation of our programs, participating in training and providing feedback on our progress in our safety journey.
​
Diversity & Inclusion
We aspire to have a culture that fosters respect, inclusion and opportunity for all. Specifically, we want our teams to understand the strength of diversity, the power that comes from an inclusive environment and the effect it can have on our teams, customers and stakeholders. Outlined below are the initiatives that demonstrate our dedication to diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”).
​
Gender diversity and equality
We continue to be committed to gender diversity. Female representation at our most senior executive leadership level is at 40%, which is the highest in the Company’s history (up from 31% in 2020). We also continue to maintain strong female representation at the Board of Directors level with five (out of ten) female Board members, representing 50% (2020: 45%). Our full time employees include 36% female representation and 64% male representation.

​



​
For the first time in 2021, we participated in The Prosperity’s Project’s Annual Report Card on Gender Diversity and Leadership. This initiative collects intersectional data on women’s representation at the leadership level in Canada and will provide valuable benchmarking information to assist us as we continue our journey related to gender diversity.

​
-

​
In 2022 and beyond, we will continue to measure and analyze recruitment efforts and strive to increase the number of candidates and hires from underrepresented groups. We plan to improve our partnership with diversity-focused organizations and increase the number of outreach campaigns to candidates from underrepresented groups.  
​
Employee Resource Groups (“ERG”)
​
Women’s LINK, our first ERG, established in 2018, which focuses on gender diversity and equality, surpassed 200 members in 2021 (2020: 190 members), appointed its first male Co-Chair demonstrating the importance of allyship in gender equality, and also launched a Spotlight Series promoting women's visibility.
​
Our second ERG, the Black Lives Matter (“BLM”) Committee, which was established in 2020, maintains a membership of around 100 members, representing 5 countries, 3 provinces and 14 states. The BLM Committee encourages courageous conversations by releasing regular feature stories related to issues affecting and contributions made by the Black community and formed a Book Club to further foster connections and dialogue among its members.
​
We also delivered on our commitment to create a framework to support our employees’ diverse needs by establishing two new ERGs:
​

● | Pride (LGBTQ+) ERG: Focuses on having Ritchie Bros. be a welcoming and inclusive workplace for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, and nonbinary (LGBTQ+) employees.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SERVE ERG: Embraces our proud community of military service members and Veteran colleagues, by building awareness and providing resources to past or present military service members and their families.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In addition to ERGs, the Company participates in numerous programs throughout the year to promote a diverse and inclusive environment such as the Diverse Voices of RB podcast series, discussion panels, feature stories, speaker series and a partnership with DiversityJobs.com. In 2022, we also plan to enact a new DE&I-related training program to understand our personal biases and learn how to address them and create an inclusive environment. 
​
At Ritchie Bros, we are committed to investing the time and resources needed to ensure we continue to live up to our DE&I vision of having a culture that fosters respect, inclusion and opportunity of growth for all.

Community Giving
The Company has been rooted in community since our founding over 60 years ago and we are committed to use our global scale and success to give back to our local communities. Our objective is to continue to maintain our community giving legacy. 
​
In 2021 after soliciting employee input, we developed a community giving framework centered around supporting local economies with the aim of helping the communities and the people in the communities in which we operate. 
​
Flexible Workplace
COVID-19 has changed the way we work and, to maintain the health and well-being of all employees, roles that were able to work remotely continued to do so throughout 2021. We received a 2021 Stevie Award for Most Exemplary Employer (COVID Response), which recognized organizations that have demonstrated extra commitment to keeping employees working, paid and safe during the pandemic.
​
We are committed to allowing flexibility in our workplace to promote performance, retention, and DE&I while also continuing to meet customer and business needs. In 2022, we will continue to monitor COVID-19 and we will adjust guidelines as necessary to support workplace flexibility while maintaining the health and safety of all.
​
Productivity
Our objective is to hire and retain employees that help generate revenues. The majority of our revenue continues to be generated by our A&M segment operations. Sales force productivity within this segment is an operational statistic that we believe provides a gauge of the effectiveness of our revenue producers in increasing GTV. Revenue producers is a term used to describe our revenue-producing sales personnel which includes regional sales managers and territory managers.
​
Ethical Conduct
Our success and reputation are founded upon our commitment to honesty, integrity, and doing what is right—each element highlighted under our value of Integrity. Our objective is to monitor and facilitate reporting of unethical conduct. We do this by maintaining a confidential and anonymous independent third-party telephone line and web access hotline for anyone to submit concerns regarding potential code violations or other ethics-related matters without fear of repercussions. All reported matters are investigated fully and reported to the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
​
The Role of Technology
Implementing a modern architecture on which we can scale and grow profitably is a core strategic pillar for Ritchie Bros. The role of technology in our business continues to evolve and become more dependent as buyers adopt mobile and online channels to transact their business with us while sellers further utilize our inventory management system. We continue to invest in technology to further transition to a modern cloud-based architecture driven by microservices that allows for agility, flexibility and scalability of our solutions.
We remain focused on technology enablement to transform the way we compete, the way we work and the way we leverage technology to drive future growth. Our technology capabilities are delivering choices for our customers in the form of multiple channels for buyers and sellers, meeting customer’s asset management needs through information-rich software solutions and leveraging our rich data repository to drive strong sales and improved pricing decisions. We are also providing our customers with leading tools and capabilities to deliver full life-cycle asset management for used equipment.
Data Privacy and Security 
As the role of technology and data in our business expands, so too does the importance of cybersecurity. We take protecting our customers, employees, brand, systems and data very seriously. We actively monitor and manage security risks and look to mitigate them through enterprise-wide programs, employee training and vulnerability assessments. We have made – and continue to make – investments in dedicated information security resources, leadership and technology. We continue to strengthen and enhance our programs and controls around people, processes and technology and apply risk-based strategies to enhance detection, protection and response efforts.

Our commitment to data security and privacy is demonstrated in our overall approach to governance. We are incorporating security and privacy by design and increasing awareness around the Company with support from management and our board by taking certain actions, including the following:

● | We have formed a Data Privacy Committee. The oversight of the committee is to develop and approve our general strategy and policies on data privacy and data protection, assess the data privacy risks associated with our business activities, and provide direction to, and support the initiatives of, our Data Privacy Office.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our Information Security and Policy committee meets on a monthly basis and advises on technology and legal and internal audit issues relating to security and risk reduction. This committee is responsible for reviewing and setting security policies, assessing risk and impacts of security incidents, and providing guidance and direction for security programs and strategy. The committee will be advised regarding information security assessment activities and will provide advice regarding education and communication that may be needed to support the information security policies and other compliance policy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | All eligible employees complete mandatory privacy and information-security training courses, which are refreshed annually. Through continual awareness-building, such as our Cybersecurity Awareness Month every October, we work to promote a culture that understands the critical importance of data security and privacy, areas of vulnerability and how to remain vigilant when handling data.

Seasonality 
Our GTV and associated A&M segment revenues are affected by the seasonal nature of our business. GTV and A&M segment revenues tend to increase during the second and fourth calendar quarters, during which time we generally conduct more business than in the first and third calendar quarters. Given the operating leverage inherent in our business model, the second and fourth quarter also tend to produce higher operating margins, given the higher volume and revenue generated in those quarters.
The restrictions imposed and effects of the overall economic environment as a result of COVID-19 may continue to impact these trends.
Revenue Mix Fluctuations
Our revenue is comprised of service revenue and inventory sales revenue. Service revenue from A&M segment activities includes commissions earned at our auctions, online marketplaces, and private brokerage services, and various auction-related fees, including listing and buyer transaction fees. We also recognize revenues from our Other Services activities as service revenue. Inventory sales revenue is recognized as part of our A&M activities and relates to revenues earned through our inventory contracts.
Inventory sales revenue can fluctuate significantly, as it changes based on whether our customers sell using a straight or guarantee commission contract, or an inventory contract at time of selling. Straight or guarantee commission contracts will result in the commission being recognized as service revenue, while inventory contracts will result in the gross transaction value of the equipment sold being recorded as inventory sales revenue with the related cost recognized in cost of inventory sold. As a result, a change in the revenue mix between service revenues and revenue from inventory sales can have a significant impact on revenue growth percentages.
Governmental Regulations and Environmental Laws 
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, provincial, state and local laws, rules, and regulations throughout the world. We believe that we are compliant in all material respects with those laws, rules, and regulations that affect our business, and that such compliance does not impose a material impediment on our ability to conduct our business.
We believe that, among other things, laws, rules, and regulations related to the following list of items affect our business:

● | Imports and exports of equipment. Particularly, there are restrictions in the U.S. and Europe that may affect the ability of equipment owners to transport certain equipment between specified jurisdictions. Also, engine emission standards in some jurisdictions limit the operation of certain trucks and equipment in those regions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Development or expansion of auction sites. Such activities depend upon the receipt of required licenses, permits, and other governmental authorizations. We are also subject to various local zoning requirements pertaining to the location of our auction sites, which vary among jurisdictions.
