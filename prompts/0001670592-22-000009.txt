Item 1. Business
Overview
Headquartered in Austin, Texas, YETI is a global designer, retailer, and distributor of innovative outdoor products. From coolers and drinkware to bags and apparel, YETI products are built to meet the unique and varying needs of diverse outdoor pursuits, whether in the remote wilderness, at the beach, or anywhere life takes you. By consistently delivering high-performing, exceptional products, we have built a strong following of brand loyalists throughout the world, ranging from serious outdoor enthusiasts to individuals who simply value products of uncompromising quality and design. We have an unwavering commitment to outdoor and recreation communities, and we are relentless in our pursuit of building superior products for people to confidently enjoy life outdoors and beyond.
We were founded in 2006 by avid outdoorsmen, Roy and Ryan Seiders (our “Founders”), who were frustrated with equipment that could not keep pace with their interests in hunting and fishing. By utilizing forward-thinking designs and advanced manufacturing techniques, they developed a nearly indestructible hard cooler with superior ice retention. Our original hard cooler not only delivered exceptional performance, it anchored an authentic, passionate, and durable bond among customers and our company.
Our principal corporate offices are located in Austin, Texas. We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in October 2018 and our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “YETI.” Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “YETI,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” used herein refer to YETI Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We have a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday closest in proximity to December 31, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in length, except during a 53-week period when the fourth quarter will be 14 weeks. Our fiscal years ended January 1, 2022 (“2021”) and December 28, 2019 (“2019”) spanned 52 weeks each, whereas our fiscal year ended January 2, 2021 (“2020”) included 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to our fiscal years ended in December and the associated quarters, months, and periods of those fiscal years. 
Our Products
Our product portfolio is comprised of three categories: Coolers & Equipment; Drinkware; and Other. We have a history of consistently broadening our high-performance, premium-priced product portfolio to meet our expanding customer base and their evolving pursuits. Our culture of innovation and success in identifying customer needs and wants drives our robust product roadmap. In 2021, net sales of Coolers & Equipment, Drinkware, and Other represented 39%, 59%, and 2% of net sales, respectively. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for net sales by product category. 
Coolers & Equipment
Our Coolers & Equipment family is comprised of hard coolers, soft coolers, cargo, bags, outdoor living, and associated accessories. Coolers & Equipment could change over time as we add new product categories and incubate them within Coolers & Equipment.
Hard Coolers. Unlike conventional hard coolers, our hard coolers are built with seamless rotationally-molded, or rotomolded, construction, making them nearly indestructible. For superior ice retention, we pressure-inject up to two inches of commercial-grade polyurethane foam into the walls and lid and utilize a freezer-quality gasket to seal the lid. We offer five product ranges within our core hard cooler category: YETI Tundra™, YETI Roadie®, Tundra Haul™, YETI TANK®, and YETI Silo™ 6G. We also offer related accessories, including locks, beverage holders, and other add-ons, to enhance our products’ versatility. In 2019, we advanced innovation and performance in hard coolers by introducing the stainless-steel body YETI V Series™ Hard Cooler, which combines the high-performing vacuum insulation technology used in our Drinkware with the construction of our iconic hard coolers to produce more efficient insulation. 
Soft Coolers. The Hopper® is our line of soft coolers, which are designed to be leakproof and provide superior durability and ice retention compared to ordinary soft coolers. The Hopper soft cooler product line includes: the next-generation Hopper® M30, Hopper BackFlip™, Hopper Flip®, Daytrip™ Lunch Bag, and Daytrip™ Lunch Box. Our soft coolers also include related accessory options such as the SideKick Dry gear case, MOLLE Zinger retractable lanyard, and a mountable MOLLE Bottle Opener.
Cargo, Bags, and Outdoor Living. Our cargo, bags, and outdoor living product category includes: the Panga™ submersible duffel bag, Panga™ Backpack, LoadOut® Bucket™, LoadOut® GoBox™, Crossroads™ Collection of backpacks, duffel bags and luggage, Camino™ Carryall, Hondo™ Base Camp Chair, Trailhead™ Camp Chair, Lowlands™ Blanket, Trailhead™ Dog Bed, and Boomer Dog Bowls. 
Drinkware
Our Drinkware product family is made with durable, kitchen-grade, 18/8 stainless-steel, double-wall vacuum insulation, and our innovative No Sweat™ design. The result is high-performing drinkware products that keep beverages at their preferred temperature — whether hot or cold — for hours at a time without condensation. Our Drinkware product line currently includes eight product families including the Rambler Colster, Rambler Lowball, Rambler Wine Tumbler, Rambler Stackable Pints, Rambler Mugs, Rambler Tumblers, Rambler Bottles, and Rambler Jug. Related accessories include the Rambler Bottle Straw Cap, Rambler Tumbler Handles, Rambler Jug Mount, and Rambler Bottle Sling.
Other
We offer an array of YETI-branded gear, such as hats, shirts, bottle openers, and ice substitutes.
Segment Information
We operate as one reportable segment.
Sales Channels
We offer our products in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and Japan through a diverse omni-channel strategy, comprised of our wholesale and our direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) channels. In 2021 and 2020, our DTC channel accounted for 56% and 53% of our net sales, respectively, and our wholesale channel accounted for 44% and 47% of our net sales, respectively. As part of our commitment to premium positioning, we maintain supply discipline, consistently enforce our minimum advertised price (“MAP”) policy, and primarily sell through one-step distribution.
In our wholesale channel, we sell to several large retailers with a national presence, including Dick’s Sporting Goods, REI, Academy Sports + Outdoors, Bass Pro Shops, Ace Hardware, and Scheels, and an assemblage of independent retail partners throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Europe. We carefully evaluate and select retail partners that have an image and approach that are consistent with our premium brand and pricing, while also seeking new retail partners that create access to unique shopping experiences or customer bases. Our network of independent retail partners includes outdoor specialty, hardware, sporting goods, and farm and ranch supply stores, among others. As of January 1, 2022, we sold through a diverse base of approximately 2,900 independent retail partners.
We sell our products in our DTC channel to consumers on YETI.com, country and region-specific YETI websites, and YETI Authorized on the Amazon Marketplace, as well as customized products with licensed marks and original artwork through our corporate sales program and at YETI.com. Our corporate sales program offers customized products to corporate customers for a wide-range of related events and activities, and in certain instances may also offer products to re-sell. Additionally, we sell our full line of products at our retail stores. Our DTC channel enables us to directly interact with our customers, more effectively deliver our brand experience, better understand consumer behavior and preferences, and offer exclusive products, content, and customization capabilities. We believe our control over our DTC channel provides our customers the highest level of brand engagement and further builds customer loyalty, while generating attractive margins.
For 2021, our largest single wholesale customer represented approximately 10% of gross sales.
Our Market
Our premium products are designed for use in a wide variety of activities, from professional to recreational and outdoor to indoor, and can be used year round. As a result, the markets we serve are broad as well as deep, including, for example, outdoor, housewares, home and garden, outdoor living, industrial, and commercial. While our product reach extends into numerous and varied markets, we currently primarily serve the United States outdoor recreation market. The outdoor recreation products market is a large, growing, and diverse economic sector, which includes consumers of all genders, ages, ethnicities, and income levels.
Additionally, we are expanding internationally as we continue to grow our presence in North America (including Canada), Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Europe. We are expanding internationally by focusing on brand awareness, wholesale expansion, and our DTC channel. We believe there are meaningful growth opportunities in expanding into additional international markets, such as Asia, as many of the market dynamics and premium, performance-based consumer needs that we have successfully identified domestically are also valued in these markets.
Product Design and Development
We design and develop our products to provide superior performance and functionality in a variety of environments. Our products are carefully designed and rigorously tested to maximize performance while minimizing complexity, allowing us to deliver highly functional products with simple, clean, and distinct designs.
We expand our existing product families and enter new product categories by designing solutions grounded in consumer insights and relevant product knowledge. We use high-quality materials, as well as advanced design and manufacturing processes, to create premium products that redefine consumer expectations and deliver best-in-class product performance. We continue to expand our product line by introducing anchor products, followed by product expansions, such as additional sizes and colorways, and then offering corresponding accessories.
To ensure our continued success in bringing category-redefining products to market, our marketing and product development teams collaborate to identify consumer needs and wants to drive our robust product roadmap. We use our purpose-built, state-of-the-art research and development centers to generate design prototypes and test performance. We follow a disciplined, stage-gate product development process that is designed to provide consistent quality control while optimizing speed-to-market. We collaborate with our YETI Ambassadors, a diverse group of men and women throughout the United States and select international markets, comprised of world-class anglers, hunters, rodeo cowboys, barbecue pitmasters, surfers, brewmasters, fitness experts, skateboarders, and outdoor adventurers who embody our brand, and industry professionals to test our prototypes and provide feedback that is incorporated into final product designs. Once we approve the final design and specifications of a new product, we partner with global suppliers and specialized manufacturers to produce our products according to our exacting performance and quality standards.
Marketing
We employ a wide range of marketing tactics and outlets to cultivate our relationships with experts, serious enthusiasts, and everyday consumers, including a combination of traditional, digital, social media, and grass-roots initiatives to support our premium brand, in addition to original short films and high-quality content for YETI.com.
Supply Chain and Quality Assurance
We manage a global supply chain of highly qualified, third-party manufacturing and logistics partners to produce and distribute our products. The primary raw materials and components used by our manufacturing partners include polyethylene, polyurethane foam, stainless-steel, polyester fabric, zippers, and other plastic materials and coatings. We believe these materials are readily available from multiple vendors. We stipulate approved suppliers and control the specifications for key raw materials used in our products. We do not directly source significant amounts of these raw materials and components.
We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We match sourcing partnerships to deliver flexibility and scalability to support multiple product introductions and evolving channel strategies. Our global supply chain management team researches materials and equipment, qualifies raw material suppliers, vets potential manufacturing partners for advanced production and quality assurance processes, directs our production planning, approves and manages product purchasing plans, and oversees product transportation. Additionally, we work closely with our manufacturing partners regarding product quality and manufacturing process efficiency.
Many of our products are manufactured in the United States, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Poland, China, Thailand, Mexico, and Malaysia. To mitigate the concentration risk in our supply chain, we are pursuing a higher diversification of manufacturing partners, with both sourcing and geographical advantages and, over time, intend to shift the current allocation of production to a different balance among them. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further discussion of concentration risk. We hold our manufacturers to rigorous quality and product conformance standards through frequent involvement and regular product inspecting. We own the molds and tooling used in the production of our products, create and provide the specifications for our products, and work closely with our manufacturing partners to improve production yields and efficiency. Our manufacturers do not have unique skills, technologies, processes, or intellectual property that prevent us from migrating to other manufacturing partners.
To ensure consistent product quality, we provide detailed specifications for our products and inspect finished goods both at our manufacturing partners as well as upon delivery to our United States-based third-party logistics partners. As part of our quality assurance program, we have developed and implemented comprehensive product inspection and facility oversight processes that are performed by our employees and third-party service providers who work closely with our suppliers to assist them in meeting our quality standards, as well as improving their production yields and throughput.
Distribution and Inventory Management
We utilize global third-party logistics providers to warehouse and distribute finished products from our distribution facilities in Memphis, Tennessee and Salt Lake City, Utah to support our domestic operations, and in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the Netherlands to support our international operations. These logistics providers manage various distribution activities, including product receipt, warehousing, certain limited product inspection activities, and coordinating outbound shipping.
We manage our inventory levels by analyzing product sell-through, forecasting demand, and placing orders with our manufacturers before we receive firm orders from customers to ensure sufficient availability.
Competition
We compete in the large outdoor and recreation market and may compete in other related markets. Competition in our markets is based on a number of factors including product quality, performance, durability, styling, and price, as well as brand image and recognition. We believe that we have been able to compete successfully on the basis of our brand, superior design capabilities and product development, our DTC capabilities, as well as the breadth of our national, regional, and independent retail partners.
In the Coolers & Equipment category, we compete against established, well-known, and legacy cooler brands, such as Igloo and Coleman, as well as numerous other brands and retailers that offer competing products. The popularity of YETI products and the YETI brand has attracted numerous new competitors including Pelican, OtterBox, and others, as well as private label brands. In the Drinkware category, we compete against well-known brands such as HydroFlask, BruMate, S’well, and CamelBak, as well as numerous other brands and retailers that offer competing products.
The outdoor and recreation market is highly fragmented and highly competitive, with low barriers to entry. Our current and potential competitors may be able to develop and market superior products or sell similar products at lower prices. These companies may have competitive advantages, including larger retailer bases, global product distribution, greater financial strength, superior relations with suppliers and manufacturing partners, or larger marketing budgets and brand recognition.
Seasonality
We are affected by seasonality. We have historically experienced net sales to be highest in the fourth and second quarters, due in part to seasonal holiday demand, followed by the third quarter, and the lowest sales in the first quarter. We expect that this seasonality will continue to be a factor in our results of operations and sales. 
Intellectual Property and Brand Protection
We own the patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights that support key aspects of our brand and products. We believe these intellectual property rights, combined with our innovation and distinctive product design, performance, and brand name and reputation, provide us with a competitive advantage. We protect our intellectual property rights in the United States and certain international jurisdictions on all new products.
We aggressively pursue and defend our intellectual property rights to protect our distinctive brand, designs, and inventions. We have processes and procedures in place to identify, protect, and optimize our intellectual property assets on a global basis. Our experienced legal and brand protection teams initiate claims and litigation to protect our intellectual property assets. In the future, we intend to continue to seek intellectual property protection for our new products and enforce our rights against those who infringe on these valuable assets.
All product designs, specifications, and performance characteristics are developed and documented. After these aspects of the process are complete, we seek intellectual property protection to the fullest extent possible, including applying for patents and for registration of trademarks and copyrights.
We have a proactive online marketplace monitoring and seller/listing termination program to disrupt any online counterfeit offerings. In addition, we work to shut down counterfeit stand-alone sites through litigation.
Human Capital Resources
At YETI, we have an unwavering commitment to outdoor and recreation communities, and we are relentless in our pursuit of building superior products for people to confidently enjoy life outdoors and beyond. We are proud of our unique company culture, where ideas, innovation, collaboration and personal development are essential. We believe our brand, culture, and employees are central to our success and our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain highly-skilled talent. 
As of January 1, 2022, we employed approximately 823 people worldwide, representing seven countries. Of these, approximately 91% of our workforce was located in the United States. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have no labor-related work stoppages and believe our relations with our employees are positive and stable.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I). We believe that an equitable, inclusive, and culturally diverse environment is imperative and key to our long-term growth. We are committed to building an inclusive and diverse culture through a variety of initiatives on employee recruitment, employee training and development. In 2020, YETI formed its DE&I Council, a group of employees representing different demographics, backgrounds, and teams that provides perspective and counsel on DE&I topics for YETI, and we also launched six voluntary, employee-led affinity groups that foster a diverse and inclusive workplace aligned with our core values, goals, and business practices. Since joining the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion in 2020, we have demonstrated our commitment to DE&I through initiatives such as hosting events led by our employee affinity groups to foster communication and education on the importance of diversity and inclusion both inside and outside of YETI; offering a six-week course on unconscious bias; updating our corporate holidays to include annual recognition of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day; and hosting an information session to discuss the origins of Equal Pay Day and YETI’s approach to pay equity.
Compensation and Benefits. We strive to hire, develop and retain top talent. We attract and reward our employees by providing competitive benefits, including market-competitive compensation, healthcare, 401(k) program, paid time off, bonding leave, as well as health, wellness, and financial planning programs. 
Communication and Engagement. We actively communicate and listen to employees through multiple internal channels and encourage employees to provide feedback about their experiences through ongoing employee engagement activities, including employee satisfaction surveys and pulse surveys on specific issues. We strive to address feedback in real time in order to continue to provide an environment where our employees can have fulfilling careers and be more productive, creative, happy, and healthy. 
Consistent with our focus on employee growth and development, we offer employees the opportunity to participate in educational activities and periodic trainings. Additionally, we employ a variety of recognition programs to recognize leadership and other employees who best exemplify our core values. We also encourage and provide opportunity for our employees to give back to the communities that support us. We provide up to four hours of paid time off to vote, as part of our participation in Time to Vote, and offer employees the chance to dedicate one full day of work to volunteering for an organization of their choice.
