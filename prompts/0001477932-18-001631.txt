ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Dais Analytic Corporation is a nano-structured polymer technology materials company having developed and now commercializing applications using its family of nanomaterial called AqualyteTM. The first commercial product is called ConsERVTM, a fixed plate energy recovery ventilator which we believe is useful in meeting building indoor fresh air requirements while saving energy and lowering emissions for most forms of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment. The second commercial product is NanoClearTM, a water clean-up process useful in the creation of potable water from most forms of contaminated water including industrial process waste water (petrochemical, steel, etc.) sea, brackish, or waste water. We are developing other nano-structured polymer technology applications including NanoAirTM, a water based no fluorocarbon refrigerant dehumidification, humidification, heating and cooling system. We believe our nano-structured polymer technology may be useful in developing a form of energy storage device capable of storing greater energy density and power per pound than traditional forms of energy storage such as capacitors or batteries.

Formation History
 
We were incorporated as a New York corporation on April 8, 1993 as Dais Corporation. We were formed to develop new, cost-effective polymer materials for various applications, including providing a lower cost membrane material for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane fuel cells. We believe our research on materials science has yielded technological advances in the field of selective ion transport polymer materials. In December 1999, we purchased the assets of Analytic Power Corporation, which was founded in 1984 to provide fuel cell and fuel processor design and consulting services, systems integration and analysis services to develop integrated fuel cell power systems. We subsequently changed our name to Dais Analytic Corporation on December 13, 1999. 
 
In March 2002, we sold substantially all of our fuel cell assets to a large U.S. oil company for a combination of cash and the assumption by such company of certain of our obligations. After we sold a substantial portion of our fuel cell assets, we focused on expanding our nano-structured polymer platform, having already identified the Energy Recovery Ventilator (“ERV”) application as our first commercial product.
 
Recent Developments
 
NanoClearTM Funding to Continue – Product Development 
 
In March 2015, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approved our application for a $1,000,000 Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award to continue developing NanoClearTM water cleaning technology for military use. The NanoClearTM funding project entitled “Non-Fouling Water Reuse Technologies” uses our patented AqualyteTM membrane to produce potable water from grey-water sources. The potential product improvements from this award will widen NanoClear’s applications in separating clean water from contaminated waste streams, potentially beginning as early as the early second quarter of 2018. 
NanoClearTM - Product Commercialization
 
We began accepting orders for delivery of our NanoClearTM industrial waste water cleaning product in late 2016. The product’s core strength, supported by company, customer, and third party generated information, is the cleanup of contaminated waste water created by a variety of manufacturing processes. NanoClearTM is designed to target the needs of the growing multi-billion dollar, worldwide waste cleaning industry’s drive to more efficiently reduce the draw on limited local fresh water supplies by large consuming industrial users, lower the impact of highly contaminated waste water on the local environment and people, and meeting the worldwide regulatory push to fully implement Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) standards. 
 
We continue to use a NanoClearTM pilot facility, commissioned in 2013 with the support of the local county government. This site serves as a showcase for potential commercial customers as well as a test-bed for newer materials and hardware prior to commercial deployment into the NanoClearTM product. 
 
Through December 31, 2017, the Company shipped thirty-six NanoClearTM systems of various sizes to customers focused on bringing on-line cost effective industrial waste water treatment systems to China and the US.

In 2017, we:  
 
- Used data from the pilot and other sources which led to the introduction in December 2017 of the advanced NanoClearTM M3 series Membrane Evaporator product. M3 has 25% greater throughput, is easier to assemble, test and maintain, and is viewed as the foundation for newer projected enhancements in 2018 and beyond.     
 
- Set up a NanoClearTM Industrial Waste Water Cleaning Unit in Shanghai, China. We use this unit to showcase our AqualyteTM based nanomaterial and engineered process to potential customers, partners, key influencers, and sales channel participants in the faster growing South East Asian market. Each test highlights the solid ROI-based advantages embodied in the NanoClearTM process as well as the product’s key technical deliverables such as high salt concentration, high quality product water, high clean water capture, and ability to replace two or more existing membrane based systems with one NanoClearTM system.     
 
- Participating as a trade show vendor in several large water industry trade shows (IE International Expo 2017, Aquatec 2017, and the international WEFEC expo in September in Chicago).     
 
- Participating as an invited speaker at industry technical conferences (China Membrane Society’s 2017 Annual Innovation Forum, and International Membrane Society - Qingdao).     
 
- Selected as one of twenty-nine companies to accompany the President of the United States on a CEO Trade Mission with the President of China in November 2017. CEO of other companies accompanying the President included Goldman Sachs, GE, Dow-Dupont, Nalco, and Fisher-Scientific. The contacts made at this event, we project, will shape a strong 2018 for NanoClearTM and other Dais products in China and other S/E Asia markets.   
 
Our revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 54% to a total of $382,934 from the third quarter of 2017. We expect revenue growth from increased sales of ConsERVTM and NanoClearTM as well as other products discussed herein. The Company’s sales plan is to generate significant revenues from the sales of NanoClearTM products in China, while penetrating the growing US market. As each of these two markets begin to generate substantial revenues, Dais will then open its focus worldwide including sales to Europe and India. 
 
Introduction of New Version of AqualyteTM Membrane Technology
 
We continue the development of Version 4 (V4) of our AqualyteTM material by adding features and improving the manufacturability of the nanomaterial. These and other improvements will allow AqualyteTM to serve a wider variety of uses in the ConsERVTM and NanoClearTM target markets. AqualyteTM is the underlying technology for our family of products, including ConsERVTM, fixed-plate Energy Recovery Ventilators (ERVs), and NanoClearTM, a high-performance contaminated water cleaning process. AqualyteTM represents the basis for a broad class of materials with unique features precisely managed by engineered processes. Features of the AqualyteTM technology include the ability to create hermetic composite membranes possessing ion conduction, high moisture transfer and high molecular selectivity. Our engineering process manages these features to offer differentiated products like ConsERVTM and NanoClearTM that are targeting worldwide needs in the clean air, energy efficiency and clean water markets. We expect to launch V4 in stages during 2018.
 
Business and Infrastructure Development in China 
 
Dais is working with companies in China to build the capability to manufacture Membrane Evaporators in-country and project to begin using this capability by the third quarter of 2018.
 
In 2017, Dais signed a multi-year supply agreement with Haier Group, of China, for our AqualyteTM membrane. Haier has been testing AqualyteTM and concluded that AqualyteTM offers unique characteristics that would be beneficial if incorporated in a select group of their products. We began to generate revenue from the first Haier application in 2017. It is projected that the revenue from this application will increase in 2018 to over $1,000,000 USD. 
 
In 2017, Dais signed a multi-year license and supply agreement with Menred Group, Zhejiang province, China to provide its Aqualyte moisture transfer nanomaterial for use in a newer line of Menred energy recovery ventilators (ERV) to be sold into the growing Chinese heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) market. Menred will use the Company’s Aqualyte nanomaterials, ConsERV core designs, and the ConsERV brand name with all their energy recovery ventilation products manufactured and sold into the residential and commercial heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) markets by its thirty sales offices in Greater China. The agreement contains provisions for sales minimums, royalties, product development, and allows for the sourcing of key components by the Company from Menred for the Company’s use in its growing energy recovery ventilation business in other parts of the world at improved pricing. We expect to generate revenue from Menred starting in the second quarter of 2018.

NanoAirTM Funding to Build Full-Size Prototype
 
In May 2015, we were selected to receive additional funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to further commercialize the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) membrane technology for our NanoAirTM product. The award is part of a total investment of nearly $8,000,000 by the DOE to advance research and development of next-generation HVAC technologies. The total funding value is $1,500,000 of which we will receive $700,000. The project will build and test a full-size rooftop unit with 7.5 tons of refrigeration capacity. Project testing will take place at the renowned Oak Ridge National Laboratory, providing the HVAC industry with independently verified data demonstrating that our technology can improve rooftop unit energy efficiency by almost 50 percent over units installed today, reduce CO2 emissions, eliminate fluorocarbon refrigerants that accelerate climate change, and improve end-user comfort with independent management of temperature and humidity.
 
Shipments of Products to New Markets; New Manufacturing in China
 
In 2016, we began shipments and sales of ConsERVTM cores to Israel, added a distributor in the Philippines, and continued our shipments of ConsERVTM cores in China. We are also speaking with several companies in the European Union interested in buying and distributing ConsERVTM cores. To help us expand our capabilities in China, we have qualified a Chinese manufacturing company to produce ConsERVTM cores using AqualyteTM membrane made in the U.S. and guided by Dais qualified manufacturing practices to meet the growing demand for ConsERVTM systems in Asia. Having cores manufactured in Asia supports our objective of expanding our distribution in the Asian market at projected lower costs and faster order fulfillment. 
Technology
 
We use proprietary nanotechnology to reformulate thermoplastic materials called polymers. Nanotechnology involves studying and working with matter on an ultra-small scale. One nanometer is one-millionth of a millimeter. A single human hair is around 80,000 nanometers in width. Polymers are chemical, plastic-like compounds used in diverse products such as Dacron, Teflon, and polyurethane. A thermoplastic is a material that is plastic or deformable, melts to a liquid when heated and to a brittle, glassy state when cooled sufficiently. 
 
These reformulated polymers have properties that allow them to be used in unique ways. We transform polymers from a hard, water impermeable substance into a material which water and similar liquids can, under certain conditions, diffuse (although there are no openings in the material) as molecules as opposed to liquid water. Water and similar liquids penetrate the thermoplastic material at the molecular level without oxygen and other atmospheric gases penetrating the material. It is believed this selectivity is dependent on the size and type of a particular molecule. We call this specialized material AqualyteTM.
 
Products
 
AqualyteTM Membrane

AqualyteTM membrane is the foundation of the Dais product line. It is made from commercially available polymer resin in flake form and industrial grade solvents which are mixed together using a proprietary process involving heat, industrial equipment, and solvents. The resin and the solvents are commercially available from any number of chemical supply houses, or firms such as Dow and Kraton (formerly Shell Elastomers then part of Royal Dutch Shell). Our process changes the molecular properties of the starting polymer resins such that in their final form they selectively allow molecules through the plastic, including water molecules. 
 
Currently, one vendor creates the final membrane form of AqualyteTM used in ConsERVTM and NanoClearTM. We have, however, identified other entities making similar types of products and believe such entities and products may provide alternatives should one be required. As noted above, we are working on this project to lower our exposure as well as our costs.
 
We have been working with an automotive Original Equipment Manufacturer on a product utilizing AqualyteTM to be sold to the transportation market. Testing has been completed and the product is being commercialized.

ConsERVTM
 
We continue widening the channels of commercialization for the ConsERVTM product. ConsERVTM is an HVAC energy conservation product which should, according to various tests, save an average of up to 30% on HVAC ventilation air operating costs, lower CO2 emissions and allow HVAC equipment to be up to 30% smaller, reducing peak energy usage by up to 20% while simultaneously improving indoor air quality. This product makes most forms of HVAC systems operate more efficiently and results, in many cases, in energy and cost savings. ConsERVTM generally attaches onto existing HVAC systems, typically in commercial buildings, to provide improved ventilation air within the structure. ConsERVTM pre-conditions the incoming air by passing over our nanotechnology polymer which has been formed into a full enthalpy heat exchanger core. The nanotechnology heat exchanger uses the stale building air that must be simultaneously exhausted to transfer heat and moisture into or out of the incoming air. For summer air conditioning, the “core” removes some of the heat and humidity from the incoming air, transferring it to the exhaust air stream thereby, under certain conditions, saving energy. For winter heating, the “core” transfers a portion of the heat and humidity into the incoming air from the exhaust air stream thereby often saving energy. 
 
ConsERVTM sales were negatively impacted at the beginning of 2017 from the December 2016 termination of the licensing agreement with Multistack LLC which required minimum monthly purchases of cores and related products by Multistack LLC and related entities.
 
When compared to similar competitive products, we believe, based on test results conducted by the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI), a leading industry association, ConsERVTM maintains an industry leading position in the management of latent heat.
 
NanoClearTM – Water Treatment
 
We have commercially introduced the first NanoClearTM membrane evaporators, which remove quantities of metals, acids, salt and other impurities from various contaminated water sources, producing potable water using an environmentally friendly, low maintenance design that is competitive with industry leaders in terms of electrical consumption. We constructed and operate a pilot plant installed at a local county waste water treatment facility that was commissioned in May 2013 and updated to the current generation of membrane evaporator in November 2016. This site has served as a showcase for potential commercial customers as well as a test-bed for newer materials and hardware readying for commercialization. The accumulated test data, analyzed by an independent 3rd party firm, shows the quality of the water being produced has not diminished since system start-up. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) measurements are holding steady at less than 10 parts per million (ppm). The evolving NanoClearTM product line purifies contaminated water, created largely during cooling of key manufacturing and utility processes. These sorts of applications are the Company’s primary focus. This includes higher salt concentrations and low pH waste streams. 
 
Follow up activity is ongoing to build and operate larger pilot installations featuring commercially available M3 membrane evaporators. Fifteen (15) different NanoClearTM pilots and demonstrations have either been brought online or are in advanced stages of fabrication at customer sites as of the end of 2017. These systems are expected to demonstrate continuous, long term treatment of customer’s wastewater as a precursor to larger installations.
 
Dais introduced its third-generation NanoClearTM membrane evaporator product line in December 2017. 
 
NanoAirTM – Water-based packaged HVAC system 
 
When development is completed, we expect this application will function to dehumidify and cool air in warm weather or humidify and heat air in cold weather. This NanoAirTM application can replace a traditional, refrigerant-based, vapor compression heating/cooling system. We have a small prototype showing fundamental cooling, humidification and dehumidification operation of this evolving product. The NanoAirTM product is in the middle stage of prototype development. Since October 1, 2010, we have been working with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to develop an energy-efficient dehumidification system using AqualyteTM polymer membranes to selectively transfer moisture. The Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E) branch of the DOE awarded up to $681,322 in initial federal funding to Dais, provided we contributed a 20% cost share (up to $171,500) towards the total project cost of $852,822. ARPA-E provided a second award of up to $800,000 in federal funding on May 1, 2013, provided we contributed a 20% cost share toward the proposed total project cost of $1,000,000. We successfully demonstrated our major goal of testing a membrane dehumidifier which met project performance targets.

The Building Technology Office (BTO) of the DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), provided a third award with up to $700,000 in federal funding, provided we contribute a 20% cost share toward the proposed total project cost of $1,500,000 ($500,000 in federal funding is provided directly to project partners at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a federally funded research and development center). We are currently working with select potential original equipment manufacturers and engineers at Oak Ridge to produce a 7.5-ton roof-top unit prototype that moves NanoAirTM toward commercialization and revenue generation. 
 
Independently, BTO engaged Navigant Consulting to evaluate 17 alternative HVAC technologies beyond the traditional vapor compression systems. The Navigant study, “Energy Savings Potential and RD&D Opportunities for Non-Vapor-Compression HVAC Technologies”, was released in March 2014 and ranked NanoAirTM membrane heat pump technology with a composite score of 4.35 on a scale of 0 – 5, one of only two technologies to exceed the 4.0 threshold marking the technology as “Most Promising”.
 
PolyCoolTM
 
PolyCoolTM technology offers strategic advantages over existing cooling tower systems. The process water being cooled is separated from the air stream by a solid AqualyteTM nanotechnology membrane that establishes a selective barrier, allowing evaporation of water molecules while preventing transmission of microbes and other contaminants. In effect, the process water is isolated in a largely closed system (similar to dry cooling technology) and initial testing shows it reduces the likelihood of dangerous germs and viruses such as Legionella becoming airborne. In-house testing has shown the ability to generate cooling effects comparable to today’s existing cooling towers while largely isolating the process water from the air stream. PolyCoolTM systems are expected to use less energy and water than a conventional cooling tower while reducing or eliminating the risk of spreading dangerous diseases. We are seeking a strategic partner who has the requisite skills to complement our nanomaterial expertise while developing this application and market access for distribution.
 
NanoCapTM 
 
Based on initial material tests conducted by two third parties, we believe that by applying a combination of our nano-materials we may be able to construct a device which stores energy as an electrical charge in a device with projected increases in energy density, endurance and usefulness relative to traditional battery technology called NanoCapTM. We project the key applications for such a device would be in transportation and/or grid energy storage. We have focused our resources on revenue producing items or uses closer to producing revenue and have not invested significant resources to date in the development of this application beyond the prototype stage. We are seeking a strategic partner for this application who has the requisite skills to complement our nanomaterial expertise in addition to having access to distribution.
 
Other
 
We have identified other potential products for our materials and processes as well as accumulating basic data to support the needed functionality and market differentiation of these products based on using our nano-technology based inventions. These other products are based, in part, upon known functionality of our materials and processes. 
Patents
 
We own the rights to fourteen U.S. patents, three Chinese patents, one Hong Kong patent, three U.S. patent applications, and four Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) applications. National stage applications based on one of the PCT applications have resulted in a patent being issued in the U.S., China, and Hong Kong with a further application pending in Europe. National stage applications based on a second PCT application have resulted in a patent being issued in both the U.S. and China. National stage applications based on a third PCT application have resulted in the issuance of a U.S. patent with a further application pending in Hong Kong. National stage applications based on the remaining two PCT applications have resulted in the issuance of two U.S. patents. Divisional applications based on two of the above mentioned PCT applications have been filed in China and Hong Kong. In addition, we co-own one PCT application with Aegis Biosciences LLC, a biomaterials drug delivery technology company. National stage applications based on the co-owned PCT application have resulted in one U.S. patent. These patents relate to, or are applications of, our nano-structured polymer materials that perform functions such as ion exchange and modification of surface properties. The polymers are selectively permeable to polar materials, such as water, in molecular form. Selective permeability allows these materials to function as a nano-filter in various transfer applications. These materials are made from base polymer resins available from a number of commercial firms worldwide and possess what we believe to be some unique and controllable properties, such as:

8


· | Selectivity: Based on our research, we believe that when the polymer is made there are small channels created that are 5 to 30 nanometers in diameter. There are two types of these channels: hydrophilic (water permeable), and hydrophobic (water impermeable). The channels can be chemically tuned to be selective for the ions or molecules they transfer. The selectivity of the polymer can be adjusted to efficiently transfer water molecules from one face to the other using these channels.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | High transfer rate: Based on in-house testing protocols and related results, we have found that the channels created when casting the materials into a nano-structured membrane have a transfer rate of water, or flux, greater than 90% of an equivalent area of an open tube. This feature is fundamental to the material’s ability to transfer moisture at the molecular level while substantially allowing or disallowing the transfer of certain other substances at a molecular level. 
· | Unique surface characteristic: The materials offer a surface characteristic that we believe inhibits the growth of bacteria, fungus and algae and prevents adhesives from attaching. 

Intellectual Property
 
As stated above, we own fourteen U.S. patents, three Chinese patents, one Hong Kong patent and co-own one additional U.S patent.

We do not have long term contractual relationships with any of our manufacturers or vendors. There are no subassemblies or components that could not be purchased from alternative suppliers. Purchases to date of raw materials and related services have been on a purchase order basis using non-disclosure agreements.
Licensing
 
In October of 2012, we entered into a License and Supply agreement with MG Energy LLC (“MGE”) owned by a shareholder of the Company. Pursuant to the agreement, we granted MGE a license to use certain technology to manufacture, sell, lease and distribute certain products for use in energy recovery ventilators installed in commercial and residential buildings in North and South America. We receive a royalty based on MGE, and any sub-licensee’s sales. In addition, as part of the license agreement, MGE and any sub licensees are to purchase certain energy recovery ventilator products from us. MGE was planning to take over the manufacturing of ConsERVTM products for sale in North America and South America in 2016, lowering our revenue but increasing our gross margin percentage, but in December of 2016 MGE and Dais mutually agreed to terminate the license agreement to use certain technology to manufacture, sell, lease and distribute certain products for use in energy recovery ventilators installed in commercial and residential buildings in North and South America. The company, after the termination, began actively seeking a newer, better arrangement to sell ConsERVTM product in North America, and worldwide. As a result of the termination, the Company recognized increased license revenue from recognition of the deferred revenue of $1,653,848 in year ended December 31, 2016.

On April 24, 2014, we entered into a Distribution Agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) with SoEX (Hong Kong) Industry & Investment Co., Ltd., a Hong Kong corporation (“Soex”). The Distribution Agreement was a covenant included in a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated January 21, 2014, between us and Soex, pursuant to which Soex purchased 37,500,000 shares of our common stock, equal to approximately 31% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2016. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, in exchange for $500,000 to be paid by October 20, 2014, royalty payments and a commitment from Soex to purchase nano-material membrane and other products from us, Soex obtained the right to distribute and market our products for incorporation in energy recovery ventilators sold and installed in commercial, industrial and residential buildings, transportation facilities and vehicles (the “Field”) in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan (the “Territory”). Further, Soex received an exclusive license in the Territory to use our intellectual property in the manufacture and sale of our products in the Field and Territory and to purchase its requirements of nano-material membrane only from us, subject to terms and conditions of the Distribution Agreement. During 2014, $50,000 of the $500,000 license fee was received. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, Soex was required to pay us $500,000, issue us 25% of the equity of a newly-created company, Soex (Beijing) Environmental Protection Technology Company Limited and pay us royalties. Soex only paid us $50,000 of the required $500,000, did not issue the required equity and did not pay any required royalties. Effective June 12, 2015, our Board of Directors ratified the termination of the Distribution Agreement, dated April 24, 2014, with Soex as a result of a breach of the Distribution Agreement by Soex. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, Soex was required to pay us $500,000, issue us 25% of the equity of a newly-created company, Soex (Beijing) Environmental Protection Technology Company Limited and pay us royalties. Soex only paid $50,000 of the $500,000 required payments, did not issue the required equity and did not pay any required royalties. We are pursuing legal action against Soex for breach of the Distribution Agreement (see Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings).
 
The above terms and amounts are not necessarily indicative of the terms and amounts that would have been incurred had comparable transactions been entered into with independent parties. 
 
In December 2017, the Company and Zhejiang MENRED Environmental Tech Co, Ltd., Zhejiang Province, China (“Menred”), entered into a License and Supply Agreement (the “Agreement”), effective December 21, 2017. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company licensed certain intellectual property and improvements to Menred, for use in the manufacture and sale of energy recovery ventilators (“ERV”) and certain other HVAC systems for installation in commercial, residential or industrial buildings in China. Menred also agreed to purchase its requirements of certain products from the Company for Menred’s use, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. Menred will also pay royalties, as defined, to the Company on a quarterly basis, based on price and production volume as provided by Menred. No royalties are due within the first year of the Agreement. Also pursuant to the Agreement, the Company is required to purchase 50,000 square meters of Product from Menred for delivery as an annual minimum with a 10,000 square meter minimum order quantity per delivery. The Agreement has a ten-year term with mutually agreed upon five year extensions.
 
Customers and Suppliers
 
We are dependent on third parties to manufacture the key components needed for its nano-structured based materials and some portion of the value-added products made with these materials. Accordingly, a suppliers’ failure to supply components in a timely manner, or to supply components that meet the Company’s quality, quantity and cost requirements or technical specifications, or the inability to obtain alternative sources of these components on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, would create delays in production of the Company’s products and/or increase its unit costs of production. Certain of the components or the processes of the Company’s suppliers are proprietary. If the Company was ever required to replace any of its suppliers, it should be able to obtain comparable components from alternative suppliers at comparable costs but this would create a delay in production. 
Research and Development
 
Expenditures for research, development and engineering of products are expensed as incurred. We incurred research and development costs of $467,524 and $939,409 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We account for proceeds received from government funding for research as a reduction in research and development costs. We recorded proceeds against research and development expenses on the Statements of Operations of $150,912 and $510,675 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Sales and Marketing Strategies
 
We also have secured and continue to discuss relationships with other leading industry HVAC manufacturers, HVAC product distributors, energy service companies and ERV manufacturers outside of North and South America. In addition, we are discussing relationships for use of our ConsERVTM products in other applications outside of energy recovery ventilation world-wide. 
 
Our unfolding sales and marketing strategy finds us focusing on creating alliances with companies having strong, existing channel presence or expertise in the target industries, notably for ConsERVTM and NanoClearTM. We are using the data and experience of initial sales in the China market to focus on growing NanoClearTM revenues in North America. We intend to bring industry seasoned talent into the company at the appropriate time to further drive market development, revenue growth and guide future product feature improvement needs. 
 
Competition and Barriers to Entry
 
We believe the efficacy of our value-added products and technology has the ability to decrease sales of competing products, thus taking business away from more established firms using older technology. We believe that our ConsERVTM product may become a functional component of newer, more efficient OEM products. A key challenge is to educate channel decision makers of the benefits of products made using our materials and processes to overcome the strength of the current product sales. Armed with the growing base of operational and third-party data this education process will become routine.
 
There are a number of companies located in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia that have been developing and selling technologies and products in the energy recovery industry as listed below. We will experience significant competition regarding our products because certain competing companies possess greater financial and personal resources than us. Future product competitors include, but are not limited to:
 

Products | Current and Future Competitors 
----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ConsERV | Semco, Greenheck, Venmar, Bry-Air, dPoint, Renewaire Holtop, Hoval, Klingenberg, Solar Palau, Kraton, Daikin and AirXchange. 
NanoClear | Dow, Dupont, Siemens, GE, Mitsubishi, Kraton and many small and regional companies using existing technologies. 
NanoAir | AAON, Trane, Carrier, York, Haier, Mitsubishi, LG, Electrolux, Samsung, Whirlpool, Kraton and Daikin. 
NanoCap | Maxwell, Ioxus. 
PolyCool | Cooling Tower Systems, Inc., Whaley Products, Evapco, Baltimore Aircoil and Paltech. Some of the large Air Conditioner manufacturing companies also produce cooling tower systems i.e. Trane and Carrier.

 
We believe that the combination of our nano-material platform’s characteristics (high selectivity, high flux rate, manufacturability, et al.) and growing patent position forms competitive advantages, which may allow us time to execute our business plan. The majority of our competitors may experience barriers to entry in these markets primarily related to the lack of similarly performing proprietary materials and processes.
 
The unique characteristics of our NanoClearTM product means we produce very pure water (TDS <10ppm) with a single module with little or no fouling of the AqualyteTM material. Competitors require multiple processes to obtain similar water purity levels and frequent cleaning procedures such as back flushing to remove fouling buildup. The requirement for multiple processes and the tendency to foul increase capital expenditures and operating costs for our competitors and limit the markets where they can potentially be applied relative to NanoClearTM.
 
Working with Chinese early adopters of NanoClearTM systems is allowing us to leverage our experience with customers in the United States and elsewhere around the world.

Government Regulation
 
We do not believe the sale, installation or use of our current nano-structured products will be subject to any government regulation, other than perhaps adherence to building codes and water safety regulations. We do not believe that the cost of complying with such codes and regulations, to the extent applicable to our products, will be prohibitive.
 
We do not know the extent to which any existing or new regulations may affect our ability to distribute, install and service any of our products. Once our other products reach the commercialization stage and we begin distributing them to our target markets, federal, state or local governmental entities may seek to impose regulations.
 
We are also subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, land use, safe working conditions, and environmental regulations regarding handling and disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous substances and emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. Our business may expose us to the risk of harmful substances escaping into the environment, resulting in potential personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property and natural resource damage. Depending on the nature of any claim, our current insurance policies may not adequately reimburse us for costs incurred in settling environmental damage claims and, in some instances, we may not be reimbursed at all. To date, we are not aware of any claims or liabilities under these existing laws and regulations that would materially affect our results of operations or financial condition.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 13 employees. None of the employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Principal Offices
 
Our principal office is located at 11552 Prosperous Drive, Odessa, FL 33556.
