Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements
 
This Report on Form 10-K contains certain statements that are “forward-looking” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Litigation Reform Act”). These forward looking statements and other information are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions made by us using information currently available.
 
The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “will,” “should” and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or using other similar expressions.
 
In accordance with the provisions of the Litigation Reform Act, we are making investors aware that such forward-looking statements, because they relate to future events, are by their very nature subject to many important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Report on Form 10-K. For example, given the cessation of our operations as a developer, manufacturer, marketer and seller of advanced polymers on January 31, 2020, resulting from the sale of substantially all of our assets to an independent third party, we became engaged in efforts to identify an operating company to acquire or merge with through an equity-based exchange transaction whereby such a transaction would likely result in a change in control. If we are unable to effect a transaction with an operating company, we may be required to cease all operations, including liquidation through bankruptcy proceedings. Accordingly, the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date hereof. In addition, you should read and carefully consider the Risk Factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10K. We assume no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise except as required by law.

Business Description
 
On January 31, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), we completed the sale of substantially all of our assets (the “Asset Sale”) for a total purchase price of $7,250,000 pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement entered into between us and Mitsubishi Chemical Performance Polymers, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“MCPP”). Prior to the Closing Date, we developed and manufactured advanced polymer materials which provided critical characteristics in the design and development of medical devices. Our biomaterials were marketed and sold to medical device manufacturers who used our advanced polymers in devices designed for treating a broad range of anatomical sites and disease states.
 
As a result of the Asset Sale, we ceased operating as a developer, manufacturer, marketer and seller of advanced polymers. Subsequent to the Closing Date, we became engaged in efforts to identify either an (i) operating company to acquire or merge with through an equity-based exchange transaction or (ii) investor interested in purchasing a majority interest in our common stock, whereby either transaction would likely result in a change in control. On October 12, 2021, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Reddington Partners LLC, a California limited liability company (“Reddington”) providing for the purchase of a total of 5,114,475 of our common stock, on a post-split basis, or approximately 90% of our total shares of common stock outstanding for total cash consideration of $400,000. Reddington purchased in two tranches on October 12, 2021 and March 15, 2022.


Pursuant to the SPA, the Company effectuated a 1-for 50 reverse stock split on March 11, 2022 (the “Reverse Split”). Accordingly, on a post-split basis, the shares purchased in connection with the First Closing resulted in Reddington owning 422,725 shares of our common stock. As set forth in the SPA, Reddington then purchased from us on March 15, 2022 an additional 4,691,750 shares of our common stock, on a post-split basis (the “Second Closing”). After the issuance thereof Reddington owned 5,114,475 shares of our common stock, or approximately 90% of our total shares of common stock outstanding.
 
Management is seeking to identify an operating company for the purposes of engaging in a merger or business combination of some kind, or acquire assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in a business that generates sustained revenues. Although we have investigated certain opportunities to determine whether they would have the potential to add value to us for the benefit of our stockholders, we have not yet entered into any binding arrangements.

We do not intend to restrict our consideration to any particular business or industry segment. Because we have limited resources, the scope and number of suitable candidates to merge with is relatively limited. Because we may participate in a business opportunity with a newly formed firm, a firm that is in the development stage, or a firm that is entering a new phase of growth, we may incur further risk due to the inability of the target’s management to have proven its abilities or effectiveness, or the lack of an established market for the target’s products or services, or the inability to reach profitability in the next few years.
 
Any business combination or transaction will likely result in a significant issuance of shares and substantial dilution to our present stockholders. As it is expected that the closing of such a transaction will result in a change in control, such transaction is expected to be accounted for as a reverse merger, with the operating company being considered the legal acquiree and accounting acquirer, and we would be considered the legal acquirer and the accounting acquiree. As a result, at and subsequent to closing of any such transaction, the financial statements of the operating company would become our financial statements for all periods presented.
 
Corporate History
 
We were founded in 1993 as a subsidiary of PolyMedica Corporation (“PolyMedica”). In June 1996, PolyMedica distributed all of the shares of CardioTech International, Inc.’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, which PolyMedica owned, to PolyMedica stockholders of record. We were engaged in the business of developing advanced polymer materials for use in medical devices designed for treating a broad range of anatomical sites and disease states. In July 1999, we acquired the assets of Tyndale-Plains-Hunter (“TPH”), a manufacturer of specialty hydrophilic polyurethanes.
 
In April 2001, we acquired Catheter and Disposables Technology, Inc. (“CDT”), a contract manufacturer of advanced disposable medical devices. In April 2003, we acquired Gish Biomedical, Inc. (“Gish”), a manufacturer of single use cardiopulmonary bypass products. In the development of our business model, we reviewed the strategic fit of our various business operations and determined that CDT and Gish did not fit our strategic direction. Gish was sold in July 2007 and CDT was sold in March 2008.
 
Effective October 26, 2007, pursuant to stockholder approval, we were reincorporated from a Massachusetts corporation to a Delaware corporation. We changed our name from CardioTech International, Inc. to AdvanSource Biomaterials Corporation, effective October 15, 2008.
 
On November 25, 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Mitsubishi Chemical Performance Polymers, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“MCPP”) for the sale of substantially all of our assets for a total purchase price of $7,250,000. The Asset Purchase Agreement was approved by our stockholders on January 21, 2020. As a result, we ceased operating as a manufacturer and seller of advanced polymers on January 31, 2020 (the “Closing Date”). Subsequent to the Closing Date, we became engaged in efforts to identify an (i) operating company to acquire or merge with through an equity-based exchange transaction or (ii) investor interested in purchasing a majority interest in our common stock, whereby either transaction would likely result in a change in control. Although certain opportunities have been investigated to determine whether a potential merger or investment opportunity could add value for the benefit of our shareholders, we have not yet entered into any binding arrangements.
 
On March 3, 2020, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, which amendment was unanimously approved by our Board of Directors, to change our name AdvanSource Biomaterials Corporation to EKIMAS Corporation.
 
On October 12, 2021, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Reddington Partners LLC, a California limited liability company (“Reddington”) providing for the purchase of a total of 5,114,475 of our common stock, on a post-split basis, or approximately 90% of our total shares of common stock outstanding for total cash consideration of $400,000. Reddington purchased in two tranches on October 12, 2021 and March 15, 2022.

As of March 31, 2022, we had no employees. Since October 13, 2021, Mr. Bennett J. Yankowitz has served as our chief executive officer and sole director in a consultative capacity.
