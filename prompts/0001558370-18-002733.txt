 Overview
 Ulta Beauty is the largest beauty retailer in the United States and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics, fragrance, skin care products, hair care products, and salon services. We provide unmatched product breadth, value, and convenience in a distinctive specialty retail environment. Key aspects of our business include:
 All Things Beauty. All in One Place.™ Our guests can satisfy all of their beauty needs at Ulta Beauty. Our stores and website offer more than 20,000 products from approximately 500 well-established and emerging beauty brands across all categories and price points, including Ulta Beauty’s own private label, the Ulta Beauty

Collection. Our bright and open store environment encourages our guests to enjoy discovering new products and services. We believe we offer the widest selection of categories across prestige and mass cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products, and salon styling tools. We also offer a full-service salon in every store featuring hair, skin, and brow services.
 Our Value Proposition. We believe our focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our guests across all of our product categories drives guest loyalty. We offer a comprehensive loyalty program, Ultamate Rewards, and targeted promotions through our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform. We also offer frequent promotions and coupons, in-store events, and gifts with purchase.
 Convenience. Our stores are predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations such as power centers. Our typical store is approximately 10,000 square feet, including approximately 950 square feet dedicated to our full-service salon. Our store design, fixtures, and open layout provide the flexibility to respond to consumer trends and changes in our merchandising strategy. As of February 3, 2018, we operated 1,074 retail stores across 48 states and the District of Columbia, as well as an e-commerce website.
 We were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige, mass, and salon products were sold through distinct channels — department stores for prestige products, drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products, and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products. We developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers All Things Beauty. All in One Place.™, a compelling value proposition, and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment. On January 29, 2017, we implemented a holding company reorganization pursuant to which Ulta Beauty, Inc., which was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in December 2016, became the successor to Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc., the former publicly-traded company and now a wholly owned subsidiary of Ulta Beauty.
 The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 and our Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
 Our strategy
 We are committed to executing our strategic imperatives to drive long-term growth and sustainable competitive advantages.
 Acquire new guests and deepen loyalty with existing guests. We believe there is an opportunity to use consumer insights and effective marketing tactics to acquire new guests and increase our “share of wallet” of existing guests. We have sharpened our brand positioning, and are increasing awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand by communicating our brand differentiation through broad scale advertising. We continue to leverage our direct mail advertising, catalogs, and newspaper inserts to communicate with our guests, as well as marketing tactics such as digital, television, in-store events, and public relations to drive brand engagement, deepen the guest connection to Ulta Beauty, and strengthen our authority in the beauty category. In addition, we continue to leverage our loyalty program and CRM platform to drive traffic, better understand our guests’ purchasing patterns, and support new store site selection. We have approximately 28 million active Ulta Beauty guests enrolled in our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program. Loyalty member transactions represent more than 90% of our annual total net sales, and the transaction data demonstrates that loyalty members shop with higher frequency and spend more per visit as compared to non-members. The customer data captured by our loyalty program, together with our CRM platform, enable customer segmentation and targeted marketing communications tailored to our guests’ unique beauty needs. We believe our loyalty program, combined with our growing CRM capabilities, provide a significant long-term competitive advantage for Ulta Beauty.
 Differentiate by delivering a distinctive and personalized guest experience across all channels. The Ulta Beauty guest experience today is differentiated by our broad array of categories, brands and price points, high quality services and friendly, well-trained, non-commissioned associates. Our opportunity is to sharpen that experience, by making it more relevant, differentiated, and personalized in-store and online. Our store associates are the key to delivering a distinctive guest experience that is personal, informative, and fun. To enable an elevated and engaging in-store guest experience, we are focusing on three key areas: process improvements, store and technology enhancements, and labor and staffing

solutions. At the same time, we are improving our e-commerce guest experience to ensure it is easy and informative with content that inspires, educates, and enables sharing and social engagement. For example, we have improved our mobile app and mobile site experience, offer a try-on app called “Glamlab” to digitally test products, and expanded our online assortment to include online only brands. Through our loyalty and CRM capabilities, we continue to emphasize targeted communications and personalized promotions that are relevant to our guests.
 Offer relevant, innovative, and often exclusive products that excite our guests. We believe our broad selection of merchandise across categories, price points, and brands offers a unique shopping experience for our guests. While the products we sell can be found in department stores, specialty stores, salons, drug stores, mass merchandisers, and pure-play e-commerce companies, we offer approximately 500 brands in one retail format so that our guests can find everything they need in one shopping trip. Our vision is to be the undisputed destination for All Things Beauty. All in One Place.™ To achieve this vision, we continue to evolve our product assortment with a focus on newness and exclusivity. We also continue to upgrade and enhance the Ulta Beauty Collection, our private label, which offers products in key categories such as cosmetics, skincare, and bath. Because of our broad array of categories, brand, and price points, we appeal to a wide range of consumers of all ages, demographics, and lifestyles.
 Deliver exceptional services in three core areas: hair, skin health, and brows. Our service offerings play an important role in delivering on our brand promise to be All Things Beauty. All in One Place.™ We plan to establish Ulta Beauty as a leading salon authority by providing high quality and consistent services from our licensed stylists, with a focus on the key pillars of hair, skin health, and brows. We provide haircare services in our full-service salons, using high quality Redken products and offering trend-right hairstyles and color. We also offer skin services in partnership with Dermalogica in all stores and brow services through Benefit Brow Bars in most of our stores. Our strategy is to drive awareness and trial of our salon services with new guests as well as accelerate the frequency of existing guests’ visits. Salon guests shop more frequently and spend three times more than non-salon guests based on loyalty guest data. We believe focusing on guest satisfaction, increasing effectiveness of promotions, and optimizing staffing and scheduling will make our services business an even stronger differentiator in our stores.
 Grow stores and e-commerce to reach and serve more guests. Our real estate vision is to make Ulta Beauty accessible and convenient to more consumers across a variety of markets, a key part of how we plan to double our market share over the next several years. We believe that over the long term, we have the potential to grow our store base to between 1,400 to 1,700 Ulta Beauty stores in the United States. We plan to further penetrate existing suburban markets, expand our presence in small markets, and further develop urban markets. We have a solid track record of executing an aggressive store growth program and a rigorous analytical approach to site selection that has translated into a high performing real estate portfolio. We expect to open approximately 100 new stores per year for the next several years.
 In addition to store expansion, we expect to significantly grow our e-commerce sales. Our e-commerce platform has two key roles: generating direct channel sales and profits, while communicating with our guests in an interactive, enjoyable way that reinforces the Ulta Beauty brand driving traffic to our stores, website, and native applications. Our omni-channel guests are extremely valuable, spending nearly three times as much as retail only guests. We continue to develop and add new website features and functionality, marketing programs, product assortment, new brands, and omni-channel integration points. We intend to establish ourselves as a leading online beauty resource by providing our guests with a rich online experience for information on key trends and products, editorial content, expanded assortments, best in class features and functionality, interactive experiences, including virtual try-on capabilities, and social media content. We also continue to improve our order fulfillment capabilities with increased speed of delivery through new distribution centers and efficient processes designed for e-commerce order fulfillment. E-commerce sales represented 9.7% of total net sales in the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018, and we expect it to continue to grow as a percentage of our mix in the future.
 Invest in infrastructure to support our guest experience and growth and capture scale efficiencies. We expect to continue to grow enterprise inventory capabilities to better anticipate and respond to our guests’ demand across all channels. This includes optimizing our distribution network, improving inventory turns by moving product faster and more frequently through all channels, and improving inventory visibility, forecast accuracy, and managing product life cycle through investments in people, process, and technology. We also plan to invest in guest-facing labor hours, training, and tools to deliver a differentiated and personalized guest experience. We expect to capture operational 

 
  3

 
efficiencies in new enterprise inventory capabilities to help fund investments in additional store labor and other in-store technologies. We will also pursue opportunities to optimize our marketing spend to maximize effectiveness. Finally, we plan to drive scale and cost efficiencies across the enterprise.
 Attract and retain talent that drives a winning culture. Leadership, culture, and engagement of our associates are key drivers of our performance. We have an experienced management team that brings a creative merchandising approach and a disciplined operating philosophy to our business. Our well-trained, non-commissioned store associates are highly engaged and deliver a differentiated guest experience. We continue to expand the depth of our team at all levels and in all functional areas to support our growth.
 Our market
 We operate within the large and growing U.S. beauty products and salon services industry. This market represents approximately $142 billion in sales, according to Euromonitor International and IBIS World Inc. The approximately $87 billion beauty products industry includes cosmetics, haircare, fragrance, bath and body, skincare, salon styling tools, and other toiletries. Within this market, we compete across all major categories as well as a range of price points by offering prestige, mass, and salon products. The approximately $55 billion salon services industry consists of hair, skin, and nail services.
 Competition
 Our major competitors for prestige and mass products include traditional department stores, specialty stores, drug stores, mass merchandisers, and the online capabilities of national retailers, as well as pure-play e-commerce companies. The market for salon services and products is highly fragmented. Our competitors for salon services and products include chain and independent salons.
 Retail stores
 Our retail stores are predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations such as power centers. Our typical store is approximately 10,000 square feet, including approximately 950 square feet dedicated to our full-service salon. The average investment required to open a new Ulta Beauty store is approximately $1.6 million, which includes capital investments, net of landlord contributions, pre-opening expenses, and initial inventory, net of payables. Our net investment required to open new stores and the net sales generated by new stores may vary depending on a number of factors, including geographic location. Our retail store concept, including physical layout, displays, lighting, and quality of finishes, has evolved over time to match the rising expectations of our guests and to keep pace with our merchandising and operating strategies. As of February 3, 2018, we operated 1,074 stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia.
 Our fiscal 2017 new store program was comprised of approximately 70% new stores opened in existing shopping centers and 30% in new shopping centers. In fiscal 2017, approximately 80% of new stores were filling in existing markets and 20% of new stores were in new markets.

 In addition to opening new stores, we also remodeled, relocated, or refreshed (prestige boutiques and related in-store merchandising upgrades) certain stores, as shown in the following table:

Stores remodeled | 11 | 12 | 4 
Stores relocated | 7 | 2 | 5 
Stores refreshed | 190 | 213 | 163 

      Salon services
 We offer a full range of services in all of our stores, focusing on the three key pillars of hair, skin health, and brow services. Our current Ulta Beauty store format includes an open and modern salon area with approximately eight to ten stations and the majority of our stores offer brow services. The entire salon area is approximately 950 square feet with a concierge desk, skin treatment room or dedicated skin treatment area, and shampoo and hair color processing area. We employ highly skilled licensed professional stylists and estheticians who offer services as well as educational experiences, including consultations, styling lessons, make-up applications, skincare regimens, and at-home care recommendations. We also have an internal elite artistic team that consists of 12 stylists and six pro team members. 
 E-commerce
 We offer more than 20,000 beauty products from hundreds of brands. Our e-commerce platform (ulta.com) is also an important resource for our guests to access product and store information, beauty trends, in-depth product reviews, and techniques. We continually enhance the website with a collection of tips, tutorials, videos, user generated content, and social content. We have significantly improved our e-commerce fulfillment capabilities through new distribution centers, processes, and systems. Merchandising
 Strategy
 We offer one of the most extensive product and brand selections in our industry, including a broad assortment of branded and private label beauty products in cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products, and salon styling tools. A typical Ulta Beauty store carries more than 20,000 products from approximately 500 well-established and emerging beauty brands across all categories and price points, including Ulta Beauty's own private label, the Ulta Beauty Collection. We present these products in an open-sell environment using centrally produced planograms (detailed schematics showing product placement in the store) and promotional merchandising planners. Our merchandising team continually monitors current fashion trends, historical sales trends, and new product launches to keep Ulta Beauty’s product assortment fresh and relevant to our guests. We believe our broad selection of merchandise, from moderate-priced brands to higher-end prestige brands, creates a unique shopping experience for our guests.
 We believe our private label products, the Ulta Beauty Collection, are a strategically important category for growth and profit contribution. Our objective is to provide quality, trend-right private label products to continue to strengthen our guests’ perception of Ulta Beauty as a contemporary beauty destination. Ulta Beauty manages the full development cycle of these products from concept through production in order to deliver differentiated packaging and formulas to build our

brand image. We also offer products such as IT Brushes for Ulta Beauty, Tarte Double Duty Beauty cosmetics, and CHI for Ulta Beauty hair care appliances that are exclusive to Ulta Beauty. The Ulta Beauty Collection and Ulta Beauty exclusive products represented approximately 6.5% of our total net sales in fiscal 2017.
 Categories
 We offer a balanced portfolio across five primary categories: (1) cosmetics; (2) skincare, bath and fragrance; (3) haircare products and styling tools; (4) salon services; and (5) other, which includes nail products and accessories. We have gained market share across all categories of our business, with particular strength in cosmetics.
 The following table sets forth the approximate percentage of net sales attributed to each category for the periods presented:

 | Fiscal year ended
 | February 3, 2018 | January 28, 2017 | January 30, 2016
Cosmetics | 51% | 51% | 46% 
Skincare, Bath & Fragrance | 21% | 20% | 23% 
Haircare Products & Styling Tools | 19% | 20% | 22% 
Salon Services | 5% | 5% | 5% 
Other | 4% | 4% | 4% 
 | 100% | 100% | 100% 

  Organization
 Our merchandising team consists of a Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer overseeing two Senior Vice Presidents who in turn oversee a team of category Vice Presidents, Divisional Merchandise Managers, and their team of buyers. Our merchandising team works with our centralized merchandise planning and forecasting group to ensure a consistent execution across our store base and e-commerce platform.
 Our planogram department assists the merchants and inventory teams to keep new products flowing into stores on a timely basis. All major product categories undergo planogram revisions on a regular basis and adjustments are made to assortment mix and product placement based on current sales trends.
 Our visual department works with our merchandising team on strategic placement of promotional merchandise, along with functional and educational signage and creative product presentation standards in all of our stores. All stores receive a centrally produced promotional merchandising planner to ensure consistent implementation of our marketing programs.
 Planning and allocation
 Our merchandising team works to ensure consistent execution across our store base and e-commerce platform. We have developed a disciplined approach to buying and a dynamic inventory planning and allocation process to support our merchandising strategy. We centrally manage product replenishment to our stores through our merchandise planning group. This group serves as a strategic partner to, and provides financial oversight of, the merchandising team. The merchandising team creates a sales forecast by category for the year. Our merchandise planning group creates an open-to-buy plan, approved by senior executives, for each product category. The open-to-buy plan is updated weekly with point-of-sale (POS) data, receipts and inventory levels and is used throughout the year to balance buying opportunities and inventory return on investment. We believe this structure maximizes our buying opportunities while maintaining organizational and financial control. Regularly replenished products are presented consistently in all stores utilizing a merchandising planogram process. POS data is used to calculate sales forecasts and to determine replenishment levels. We determine promotional product replenishment levels using sales history from similar or comparable events. To ensure our inventory remains productive, our planning and replenishment group, along with senior executives, monitor the levels of clearance and aged inventory in our stores on a weekly basis. We continue to optimize our merchandising planning and forecasting system, master data, and space and floor planning systems.

 Vendor partnerships
 We have strong, active relationships with our more than 400 vendor partners. Our top ten vendor partners, such as Estée Lauder Companies, L’Oréal, and Shiseido among others, represented approximately 64% of our total net sales in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. We believe our vendor partners view us as a significant distribution channel for growth and brand enhancement and we work closely with them to market both new and existing brands.
 Marketing and advertising
 Marketing strategy
 We employ a multi-faceted marketing strategy to increase brand awareness, drive traffic to our stores and website, acquire new guests, improve guest retention, and increase frequency of shopping. We communicate with our guests and prospective guests through multiple vehicles, including direct mail catalogs, newspaper inserts, television, radio, and digital advertising. These vehicles highlight the breadth of our selection of prestige, mass, and salon beauty products, new products and services, and special offers, and are designed to increase brand awareness. Our comprehensive public relations strategy enhances Ulta Beauty’s reputation as a beauty destination, increases brand awareness, supports our charitable efforts on behalf of The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, and drives awareness of new products, in-store events, and new store openings.
 Our loyalty program, Ultamate Rewards, is an important tool to increase retention of existing guests and to enhance their loyalty to the Ulta Beauty brand. Approximately 28 million active loyalty program members generated more than 90% of Ulta Beauty’s total net sales in fiscal 2017. Ultamate Rewards enables customers to earn points based on their purchases. Points earned are valid for at least one year and may be redeemed on any product we sell. Our CRM platform enables sophisticated mining of the customer data in our loyalty member database as well as greater personalization of our marketing campaigns. To enhance our loyalty program, we launched co-branded and private label credit cards in fiscal 2016. The credit cards drive higher wallet share and greater loyalty from our rewards members, provide increased consumer insights, and offer attractive economics. In fiscal 2017, we expanded our gift card program to increase distribution to thousands of supermarkets and other retailers through a partnership with a third party.
 We are directing a growing percentage of our marketing expense toward email marketing, digital marketing, and national TV and radio advertising. We believe these channels are highly effective in communicating with existing guests, as well as reaching those who have not yet shopped with us. Our email marketing program has been effective in communicating with our existing online and retail guests in a targeted and relevant way. Our digital marketing strategy includes search engine optimization, paid search, mobile advertising, social media, display advertising, and other digital marketing channels. Digital marketing, coupled with our national TV and radio advertising, has helped us grow brand awareness among those not familiar with Ulta Beauty, which we believe has resulted in new guests and reactivation of guests who have not shopped at Ulta Beauty within the last year.
 Staffing and operations
 Retail stores
 Our current Ulta Beauty store format is staffed with a general manager, a salon manager, two associate managers, a full time prestige manager, and approximately twenty full and part-time associates; including approximately four to eight prestige consultants and eight to ten licensed salon professionals. The management team in each store reports to the general manager. The general manager oversees all store activities including salon management, inventory management, merchandising, cash management, scheduling, hiring, and guest services. Members of store management receive bonuses depending on their position and based upon various metrics. Each general manager reports to a district manager, who in turn reports to a Regional Vice President of Operations, who in turn reports to the Senior Vice Presidents of Store Operations, who in turn reports to our Chief Store Operations Officer, who in turn reports to the Chief Executive Officer. Each store team receives additional support from time to time from recruiting specialists for the retail and salon operations, regionally based human resource managers, a field loss prevention team, salon technical trainers, management trainers, and vendor partners.

 Ulta Beauty stores are open seven days a week, typically eleven hours a day, Monday through Saturday, and seven hours on Sunday. Our stores have extended hours during the holiday season.
 Salon services
 A typical salon is staffed with eight to ten licensed salon professionals, including a salon manager, six stylists, and one or two estheticians. Our most productive salons have a guest coordinator and an assistant manager. Our salon technical trainers and vendor partner education classes create a comprehensive educational program for approximately 8,800 Ulta Beauty salon professionals.
 Training and development
 Our success is dependent in part on our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate qualified associates at all levels of the organization. We have developed a corporate culture that enables individual store managers to make store-level operating decisions and we consistently reward high performance. We are committed to continually developing our associates and providing career advancement opportunities. Our associates and management teams are essential to our store expansion strategy. We use a combination of existing managers, promoted associates, and outside hires to support our new stores.
 All of our associates participate in an interactive new-hire orientation through which each associate becomes acquainted with Ulta Beauty’s mission, vision, and values. We train and educate our new store managers, prestige beauty advisors, and sales associates on our beauty products and services, our policies and procedures, opening and closing routines, guest service expectations, loss prevention practices, and our culture. We provide continuing education to salon professionals and retail associates throughout their careers at Ulta Beauty. Our learning management system allows us to provide ongoing training to all associates to continually enhance their product knowledge, technical skills, and guest service expertise. In contrast to the sales teams at traditional department stores, our retail sales teams are not commissioned. Our prestige beauty advisors are trained to work across all prestige lines and within our prestige boutiques (sets of custom-designed fixtures configured to prominently display certain prestige brands within our stores), where guests can receive makeup demonstrations, skin analysis, and assistance in selecting the products and services that suit them best.
 Distribution 
 Our vision is to develop an expanded and optimized end-to-end supply chain that improves operational efficiency, performance, and guest experience. This includes enhanced systems and processes as well as a modernized distribution center network to support our new store program and rapid e-commerce growth. We currently operate five distribution centers and will open a sixth distribution center in Fresno, California in fiscal 2018.
 Inventory is shipped from our suppliers to our distribution centers. We carry more than 20,000 products and replenish our stores with such products primarily in eaches (i.e., less-than-case quantities), which allows us to ship less than an entire case when only one or two of a particular product is required. Our distribution centers use distribution management and distribution control software systems to maintain and support product purchase decisions. Store replenishment order selection is performed using pick-to-light processing technologies. Product is delivered to stores using a broad network of contract and local pool (final mile) carriers.
 Information technology
 We are committed to using technology to enhance our competitive position. We depend on a variety of information systems and technologies to maintain and improve our competitive position and to manage the operations of our growing store base. We rely on computer systems to provide information for all areas of our business, including supply chain, merchandising, POS, e-commerce, marketing, finance, accounting, and human resources. Our core business systems consist mostly of purchased software programs that integrate together and with our internally developed software solutions. Our technology also includes a company-wide network that connects all corporate users, stores, and our distribution center infrastructure and provides communications for credit card and continual polling of sales and 

 
  8

 
merchandise movement at the store level. We intend to leverage our technology infrastructure and systems where appropriate to gain operational efficiencies through more effective use of our systems, people, and processes. We update the technology supporting our stores, distribution infrastructure, and corporate headquarters on a regular basis. We will continue to make investments in our information systems to facilitate our growth and enable us to enhance our competitive position.
 Intellectual property
 We have registered trademarks in the United States and other countries. The majority of our trademark registrations contain the ULTA mark, including Ulta Beauty and two related designs, Ulta.com and Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance (and design). We maintain our marks on a docket system to monitor filing deadlines for renewal and continued validity. All marks that are deemed material to our business have been applied for or registered in the United States and select foreign countries, including Canada.
 We believe our trademarks, especially those related to the Ulta brand, have significant value and are important to building brand recognition.
 Government regulation
 We are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions, and similar constraints. Such laws, regulations, and other constraints may exist at the federal, state, or local levels in the United States. Many of the products we sell in our stores, such as cosmetics, dietary supplements, food and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, medical devices, and styling tools, including our Ulta Beauty branded products, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), state regulatory agencies, and State Attorneys General (State AGs). Such regulations principally relate to the safety, labeling, manufacturing, advertising, packaging, and distribution of the products.
 Products classified as cosmetics (as defined in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act)) are not subject to pre-market approval by the FDA, but the products must generally be safe and must be properly manufactured and labeled. Certain products, such as sunscreens and acne treatments, are classified as OTC drugs, and certain ingestible products, such as vitamins and minerals, are classified as dietary supplements. Both OTC drugs and dietary supplements have specific ingredient, labeling, and manufacturing requirements. The labeling and packaging of these products is subject to the requirements of the FDC Act and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. Products such as wrinkle reducing lights may be classified as medical devices and, in addition to being subject to labeling and manufacturing requirements, may also be subject to premarketing review by the FDA. Finally, products such as styling tools (e.g. blow dryers and curling irons) are regulated by the CPSC, which has strict requirements with respect to reporting possible product defects.
 Further, claims we make in advertising, including claims about the safety or efficacy of products, pricing claims and environmental claims, are subject to regulation by the FTC and State AGs who generally prohibit unfair or deceptive practices.
 Labor and employment and taxation laws, to which most retailers are typically subject, also impact our day-to-day operations. We are also subject to typical zoning and real estate land use restrictions and typical advertising and consumer protection laws (both federal and state). Our services business is subject to state board regulations and state licensing requirements. 
 In our store leases, we require our landlords to obtain all necessary zoning approvals and permits for the site to be used as a retail site and we also ask them to obtain any zoning approvals and permits for our specific use (but at times the responsibility for obtaining zoning approvals and permits for our specific use falls to us). We require our landlords to deliver a certificate of occupancy for any work they perform on our buildings or the shopping centers in which our stores are located. We are responsible for delivering a certificate of occupancy for any remodeling or build-outs that we perform and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws in connection with such construction projects or build-outs.

 Employees
 As of February 3, 2018, we employed approximately 13,700 associates on a full-time basis and approximately 21,000 associates on a part-time basis. We have no collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe we have good relationships with our employees. Seasonality
 Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. Significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. To a lesser extent, our business is also affected by Mother’s Day, Valentine’s Day, and the “Back to School” season.
