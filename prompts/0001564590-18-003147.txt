--------+---------

Overview
 
We are an innovative and leading provider of mission-critical investment decision support tools, including indexes; portfolio construction and risk management products and services; Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) research and ratings; and real estate research, reporting and benchmarking offerings.  Our research-derived intellectual property includes methodologies, models, derived data and algorithms (collectively, “content”), as well as applications and services, which help our clients manage their investment processes and address their investment, risk and regulatory challenges. We leverage our knowledge of the global investment process and our expertise in research and data collection to deliver content to our clients that helps them make more efficient and informed investment decisions.  Our content is delivered through multiple channels, including through our proprietary applications, application programming interfaces (“API”) and third-party applications and is directly embedded into client platforms.  We also offer services that help clients use our content and applications more effectively and operate more efficiently.  
 
We operate as “One MSCI” and as a client-centric company. We achieve this by managing our client coverage, research, data and technology groups in an integrated manner to best leverage our unique intellectual property and differentiated know-how across product lines to deliver innovative and high quality content to our clients.  As the needs of our clients change, we respond with offerings that address their evolving strategic and investment objectives (our “go-to-market strategy”). Our clients use our offerings across multiple asset classes to achieve a wide range of objectives, including benchmarking, index-linked product creation, portfolio construction, performance measurement and attribution, risk management, as well as investor and regulatory reporting.  In addition, our clients are increasingly integrating the new content developed across our company, such as factor and ESG data and indexes, into their investment processes.  
 
Clients
 
Our clients comprise a wide spectrum of the global investment industry and include asset owners (pension funds, endowments, foundations, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, family offices and insurance companies), asset managers (institutional, mutual funds, hedge funds, exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), private wealth, private

Growth Strategy 
 
Our products and services are deeply integrated in the global investment ecosystem and in our clients’ investment processes.  We aim to expand our position as a leading source for mission critical content, applications and services that support the investment processes of the largest and most sophisticated participants in the global investment industry.  The investment industry is experiencing a number of notable trends that are transforming the landscape of investment institutions and the manner in which they operate. These trends, which are creating attractive opportunities for us, include: (1) increased globalization, which is driving demand for global indexes and factor models, (2) increased investing complexity, which is driving demand for sophisticated portfolio and risk management products, (3) an increased focus by investment institutions on designing and implementing lower cost and outcome-oriented strategies, which often take the form of index-based products and necessitate an understanding of the factors driving risk and return, (4) an increased integration of factor and ESG criteria into the investment process, which is driving demand for our factor and ESG content and applications, and (5) the outsourcing by investment institutions of non-core functions and the consolidation of external systems, content and vendors in order to leverage technology and services to scale efficiently, which benefits our managed service offerings and leverages our footprint across a client organization. 
 
Against the backdrop of these industry trends, we are well positioned to leverage our competitive advantages to help investment institutions create sustainable business models today and into the future. We have a number of competitive advantages, including deep knowledge of the global investment process, experienced research, product development and data management teams that create and promote relevant and high quality content and offerings and a client coverage team that helps build and maintain strong and trusted client relationships with the world’s largest investment institutions. Additionally, we have a knowledgeable information technology team that develops scalable technology and data infrastructure that allow us to scale our operations, as well as help our clients be more cost-effective in their own operations through the use of our applications and services. We have the opportunity to provide innovative content, strengthen our go-to-market strategy, and deliver enhanced capabilities through our flexible applications and outstanding client offerings and services as One MSCI. 
 
Our growth strategy is focused on a number of key initiatives that optimize the value of One MSCI and capitalize on our competitive advantages to address the changing needs of our clients and the investment industry. These strategic initiatives include:
 
 
• | Create broad and innovative research-driven content. Our research-driven content plays a key role in our ability to deliver offerings required to help our clients develop relevant, global and sustainable investment strategies in an efficient manner and with the highest standards for data quality. We have proprietary applications and databases that house data from more than 200 third-party sources in addition to our proprietary data. We have also amassed an extensive database of historical global market data, proprietary equity index data, private real estate benchmark data, risk algorithms and models and ESG data, all of which are critical components of our clients’ investment processes. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
2

We take an integrated team approach to developing offerings across our segments.  Our product management, research, data operations and technology and application development departments are at the center of this process.  Our content is developed by a cross-functional research team of mathematicians, economists, statisticians, financial engineers and investment industry experts. We monitor investment trends and their drivers globally and support instrument valuation, risk modeling, portfolio construction, asset allocation and Value at Risk (“VaR”) simulation. An important way we monitor global investment trends and their implications for our business is through direct public consultations and client advisory panels and through the forum provided by our Editorial Advisory Board (“EAB”). Our EAB, which was established in 1999, meets twice a year to discuss industry and emerging trends and is comprised of senior investment professionals from around the world and senior members of our research team. We also hold consultations and regional client advisory panels that bring together a diverse group of investment leaders and practitioners.
 
Over the past three years, we have directed the majority of our investments toward research, data production systems and technology infrastructure and applications to enable us to develop new content more quickly and deliver new and previously existing content more cost-effectively. For more information about our research and development and associated costs, see Note 1, “Introduction and Basis of Presentation—Significant Accounting Policies, Research and Development” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein and “Research and development” in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.  
 
In 2017, we appointed a new Global Head of Research and Product Development who leads a team of more than 180 employees, many of whom have obtained PhDs in fields that are relevant to our business.  By focusing on cross-product and cross-functional innovation, we can maximize the capabilities of each of our four operating segments—Index, Analytics, ESG and Real Estate—in order to bring greater value to our clients. We expect to grow as One MSCI through the ongoing integration of the full suite of offerings provided by each of our four segments.  For example, we have incorporated our new global equity model (from the Analytics segment) as well as our ESG ratings research into our Index offerings.  In addition, we have combined risk measures from the Real Estate segment with asset and portfolio level risk models from the Analytics segment to enhance our multi-asset class and Real Estate risk management offerings.  
 
 
• | Expand the client base and deepen existing client relationships. Our global vantage point enables us to view financial markets in terms of what matters to global investors and financial institutions. We believe our global operating footprint is a competitive advantage that enables us to tailor our coverage initiatives to better serve our clients in the markets where they operate. From over 30 offices in the Americas, EMEA and Asia, we consult with clients and other market participants to develop content and provide insights about global risk-taking and opportunity. Our research and product management teams seek to understand our clients’ investment processes and needs in order to generate content and design offerings that help clients understand the dimensions of performance and risk in their portfolios and make better-informed investment decisions. Our consultative approach to content development, dedication to client support and range of offerings enable us to build strong relationships with investment professionals and institutions around the world. As of December 31, 2017, we served over 7,000 clients across 88 countries worldwide.1 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In recent years, we have realigned our global client coverage function to sharpen our focus on current clients and improve our ability to identify new prospects. In 2017, we repositioned the role of the Chief Operating Officer to be more aligned with our client and go-to-market strategies.  The Chief Operating Officer currently manages our sales, marketing, client relationship management and client service teams globally with the goal of integrating our outreach to clients and prospects, sales and marketing strategy and client service. To ensure that we provide world-class service to our largest accounts, as of December 31, 2017, we have assigned senior account managers to more than 50 of our largest accounts by revenue, and appointed key account managers to cover more than 90 of our other large accounts.

If we aggregate all related clients under their respective parent entity, the number of clients would be approximately 4,000 as of December 31, 2017.

In support of our clients and the continual development of our brand, our industry and content experts are interviewed as thought leaders and commentators in prominent financial and trade media and have written research pieces that have served as the basis of news articles around the investment world.  Members of our research team and other employees regularly speak at industry conferences, as well as at our own events.  For example we hosted more than 650 seminars, webinars, conferences and workshops in various locations around the world in 2017.  These events bring our employees and clients together, expose clients to our latest research and content enhancements, enable client access to global industry experts and policymakers, and give our employees an opportunity to gain better insights into our clients’ needs.
 
 
• | Develop flexible and scalable technology. Technology enhances access to our content and enables us to better meet our clients’ needs. Many of our proprietary risk analytics are made available to clients through our proprietary applications. Our application development methodology leverages best practices from the software industry, including agile development, testing protocols, iterative development cycles and beta releases. Our application development projects involve extensive collaboration with our product management team and our clients. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We plan to continue improving the user experience of our clients and the accessibility of our full suite of content, applications and services by enhancing the functionality of our technology and increasing the performance, stability and scalability of our platforms.  We have invested in our data centers, technology platforms and applications to provide scalable solutions for the processing of large volumes of asset and portfolio data. In doing so, we are not only able to operate in a more cost-effective manner as a firm, but are also able to offer clients computing capacity that they would not be able to access in a cost-effective manner through internal development.  We will also continue to invest in developing a platform that integrates our technology and content into a single interface and client experience.  For example, we are building the MSCI Analytics Platform with an open architecture that will provide clients with greater flexibility to access content across the Company’s four operating segments, create new formulas and calculations, add their own data and analytical engines, and connect with other client and vendor systems.  Elements of this new platform were launched in 2017, and we continue to allocate resources to developing additional functionality within the platform in order to better meet the needs of our clients.
 
 
• | Expand value-added service offerings. Continued pressure on management fees is causing our clients to look for ways to become more operationally efficient. Our managed services include end-to-end services that aim to assist clients with meeting operational and regulatory requirements by providing a convenient and cost-effective way to outsource data processing and reporting. Our clients’ outsourcing of these functions to our data management professionals enables them to focus more on value-added work such as risk budgeting, asset allocation, manager selection and monitoring. Our end-to-end services include consolidation of data from various sources, data reconciliation analysis, uploading of data into our risk and portfolio management applications, identification of data anomalies and customized client reporting. We continue to improve each of these services and provide new services that will be designed to make our clients’ operations and use of our offerings more efficient. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Execute strategic relationships and acquisitions. We regularly evaluate and selectively pursue strategic relationships with, and acquisitions of, providers of products and technologies and companies that we believe have the potential to complement, enhance or expand our offerings and client base, as well as improve our ability to provide mission critical content, applications and services to enhance the investment decision processes of investment institutions, and the intermediaries that serve such institutions. In order to drive value, we target acquisitions and strategic relationships that can be efficiently integrated into our existing operational structure and global sales network. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Business Model
 
Our principal business model is to license annual, recurring subscriptions to our offerings for a fee, which is, in a majority of cases, paid in advance. Fees may vary by offering, number of users or volume of services.
 
4

We also charge clients to use our indexes as the basis for index-linked investment products, such as ETFs, or as the basis for passively managed funds and separate accounts. These clients commonly pay us a license fee, typically in arrears, for the use of our intellectual property primarily based on the assets under management (“AUM”) in their investment product.
 
Certain exchanges use our indexes as the basis for futures and options contracts and pay us a license fee, typically paid in arrears, for the use of our intellectual property primarily based on their volume of trades.
 
Clients also subscribe to periodic benchmark reports, digests and other publications associated with our Real Estate offerings. Fees are primarily paid in arrears after the offering is delivered.
 
We also realize one-time fees related to customized reports, historical data sets and certain implementation and consulting services, as well as from certain offerings that are purchased on a non-renewal basis.  See Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Segment Results” for a break-down of revenues attributable to recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees and non-recurring revenue for our Index, Analytics and All Other reporting segments. 
 
Operating Segments
 
As the investment industry becomes more global and investors become increasingly focused on multi-asset class portfolios, we are well positioned to help our clients achieve their investment objectives by delivering a more comprehensive analysis of their investment strategies using the content, applications and services across our four operating segments—Index, Analytics, ESG and Real Estate.  Because the ESG and Real Estate operating segments do not meet segment disclosure reporting thresholds, ESG and Real Estate are combined and presented as All Other for reporting purposes. See Note 12, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein, for additional information on our current segment reporting structure and financial information for each segment. 
Index
 
Clients use our indexes in many areas of the investment process, including index-linked product creation and performance benchmarking, as well as portfolio construction and rebalancing, and asset allocation. We currently calculate more than 200,0001 end-of-day indexes daily and more than 11,000 indexes in real time. As of June 30, 2017, more than $12.4 trillion of assets under management were benchmarked to MSCI indexes (as reported on September 30, 2017 by eVestment, Morningstar and Bloomberg). Clients receive data directly from us or from one or more third-party providers of financial information worldwide that distribute our equity indexes.  Our indexes cover a variety of markets and industries.  In addition, we use content generated by our Analytics, ESG and Real Estate segments to help construct some of our equity indexes, including some with the highest revenue growth rates.  Products in our Index segment include:

• | MSCI Global Equity Indexes. MSCI Global Equity Indexes are designed to measure returns across a wide variety of equity markets (e.g., Europe, Japan, USA, Emerging Markets), size segments (e.g., mid and large capitalization), and industries (e.g., banks, media). As of December 31, 2017, we calculated indexes that covered more than 80 countries in developed, emerging and frontier markets, as well as various regional indexes built from the component country indexes. These indexes include the MSCI ACWI IMI, MSCI World, MSCI EAFE, MSCI Emerging Markets and MSCI USA Indexes. We believe that MSCI Global Equity Indexes are the most widely used benchmarks by cross-border equity funds. A large number of asset owners use the MSCI ACWI IMI Indexes as the policy benchmark for their equity portfolios. More than 85% of international equity assets are benchmarked to MSCI Global Equity Indexes.

• | MSCI Custom Indexes. We currently calculate approximately 9,700 custom indexes by applying a client’s criteria to an existing MSCI index. Examples of customization criteria include liquidity screening, currency

hedging, tax rates, stock exclusions or special weighting. Custom indexes can reflect specific investment criteria, such as socially responsible investment requirements or regulatory constraints. They can be used for back-testing strategies, developing specialized investment products, minimizing portfolio tracking error or constructing index-linked products.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | MSCI Factor Indexes. MSCI Factor Indexes, which are constructed using the Barra Equity Models generated in our Analytics segment, seek to address a growing trend among institutional investors and asset managers whose asset allocation processes include risk groupings such as volatility, income, value and momentum. MSCI Factor Indexes reflect components of equity return that can be attributed to sources of systematic risk and return such as value, size, momentum, volatility, yield and quality. We offer a broad suite of factor indexes that have been developed using the expertise of our Analytics segment, including high-exposure factor indexes (e.g., the MSCI Minimum Volatility Index), high capacity factor indexes (e.g., MSCI Value Weighted Indexes), combinations of single factor indexes (e.g., MSCI Factor Mix A-Series Indexes) and multi-factor indexes (e.g., MSCI Diversified Multiple-Factor Indexes).

• | MSCI ESG Indexes. MSCI ESG Indexes, which are constructed using research from our ESG segment, are designed to meet the growing demand for indexes that integrate ESG criteria into benchmarks to measure performance for use by institutional investors who wish to adopt a long-term sustainable investment view. They enable clients to issue index-based ESG investment products, to benchmark the performance of ESG portfolios and to measure and report on compliance with ESG mandates. The MSCI ESG Indexes include:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | ESG Integration Indexes that are designed to help investors incorporate ESG criteria into their core asset allocation and investment process. These include the MSCI ACWI ESG Universal Index or MSCI ESG Leaders Index, which use MSCI ESG Ratings to identify companies that have demonstrated an ability to manage their ESG risks and opportunities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Values-based Indexes that select companies with the highest ESG Ratings but also exclude companies based on certain values, norms or ethical standards. These include the MSCI SRI Index and the KLD 400 Social Index;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Environmental Indexes, including Low Carbon Indexes, Global Environment Indexes, and Fossil Fuels Exclusion Indexes that help investors reduce their carbon exposure or capture opportunities in renewable energy and clean technology;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Impact Indexes, such as the Sustainable Impact Index that aims to identify companies that derive revenues from products and services that address environmental and social challenges aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations; and

• | MSCI Real Assets Indexes. MSCI provides a comprehensive suite of Real Assets Indexes that provide investors transparency and insight for this asset class. MSCI’s Real Assets Indexes include MSCI Real Estate Indexes (e.g., MSCI US REIT Index; MSCI Sector/Core/Factor/Liquid Real Estate Indexes), MSCI Infrastructure Indexes, MSCI Agriculture Producers Indexes, MSCI Timber Select Index, MSCI Commodity Producers Indexes and MSCI Natural Resources Indexes.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Global Industry Classification Standard (“GICS”®). GICS was developed and is maintained jointly by MSCI and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC, a subsidiary of S&P Global Inc. (“Standard & Poor’s”). This classification system was designed to respond to clients’ needs for a comprehensive, consistent and accurate framework for classifying companies into industries. GICS is widely accepted as an industry analysis framework for investment research, portfolio management and asset allocation. We offer GICS Direct, a joint offering of MSCI and Standard & Poor’s. GICS Direct is a database comprised of over 45,000 active companies and 58,000 securities classified by sector, industry group, industry and sub-industry in accordance with the proprietary GICS methodology. 90 of the top 100 global asset managers

use GICS (as reported by P&I in its report dated April 2017). The MSCI Global Sector Indexes are comprised of GICs sector, industry group, and industry indexes across countries and regions in developed, emerging and select frontier markets. The MSCI Global Sector Indexes provide a global structure for benchmarking sectors and can also serve as the basis for index-linked structured products and other investment vehicles, such as ETFs and exchange-traded notes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Analytics
 
Our Analytics segment offers risk management, performance attribution and portfolio management content, applications and services that provide clients with an integrated view of risk and return and an analysis of market, credit, liquidity and counterparty risk across all major asset classes, spanning short, medium and long-term time horizons.  Our offerings also support clients’ various regulatory reporting needs.
 
The content we create in our Analytics segment includes models to support factor-based analytics (equity, fixed income and multi-asset class models), pricing models, time series-based analytics, as well as underlying content that is used as inputs to these models such as interest rate and credit curves.  We continue to develop new and improved content in response to the evolving needs of our clients.  During 2017 we continued to make improvements to our fixed income factor model (first released in late 2016), including releasing new variants of the model that align with the different time horizons for which clients invest. Further, this fixed income model has been combined with models that cover currencies, commodities, equities, mutual funds, hedge funds and private assets – private real estate and private equity – to deliver our next generation multi-asset class factor model (the MSCI Integrated Model) providing clients with greater insights into the drivers of risk in their portfolios.  Our Analytics content includes:
 
 
• | Equity Factor Models. The proprietary risk data in Barra Equity Models provides clients with a better understanding of their sources of risk and return and a factor structure that is aligned to multiple investment horizons, which enables them to select the risk data that best suits their investment analysis. Barra Equity Models are available through our applications, third-party applications and directly to clients for integration into their own applications. In addition, we use Barra Equity Models in our Index segment to construct MSCI Factor Indexes. Barra Equity Models include Barra Global Total Market Models, Barra Regional Equity Models and Barra Single Country Models.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Multi-Asset Class Factor Models. Our Multi-Asset Class Models provide a detailed view of risk across markets and asset classes, including currencies, equities, fixed income, commodities, mutual funds, hedge funds and private assets, including private real estate (for which we use content from our Real Estate segment) and private equity investments. The process of creating our Multi-Asset Class Models begins by identifying the factors that affect the returns of various asset classes. These factors are then combined into a single global model that forecasts the risk of multi-asset class global portfolios. Multi-Asset-Class Models include the Barra Integrated Model (“BIM”) as well as the next generation MSCI Integrated Model (“MIM”) which, among other enhancements, leverages our new fixed income models.

• | Multi-Asset Class Risk and Performance Analytics. Our Multi-Asset Class Risk and Performance Analytics provide a full suite of single security and portfolio level analyses used by clients to measure and attribute risk and performance in multi-asset class portfolios. Multi-Asset Class Risk and Performance Analytics include pricing models, sensitivities, stress testing, liquidity risk analytics, performance attribution, and a comprehensive set of configurable statistical risk measures such as standard deviation, tracking error, correlations and VaR.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our clients access our Analytics content through our own proprietary applications and APIs, or through third- party applications or directly on their own platforms.  MSCI Analytics applications provide clients with integrated market data and constituent-level indexes aggregated from multiple third-party and proprietary sources. This integrated market and benchmark data significantly reduces the operational burden on clients for both the implementation and on-going running of our Analytics products.

Our major applications include the following:
 
 
• | RiskMetrics RiskManager. We believe that RiskMetrics RiskManager is an industry leader in VaR simulation and in stress testing. Clients use RiskManager for daily analysis, measuring and monitoring of market and liquidity risk at fund and firm levels, sensitivity and stress testing, interactive what-if analysis, counterparty credit exposure and regulatory risk reporting. RiskManager is a scalable platform accessed by clients via a license to a secure, interactive web-based application service. RiskManager is also offered as an outsourced risk reporting service or as a web service in which a client’s systems access RiskManager’s core risk elements by connecting directly to our systems.

• | BarraOne. BarraOne, powered by our Multi-Asset Class Models, BIM and MIM, provides clients with global, multi-asset class risk analysis using Barra’s fundamental factor methodology originally developed in 1975 that allows clients to understand the themes driving the risk and performance of their investments. These themes (e.g., Value, Momentum, etc.) are what Barra calls Factors. BarraOne also includes VaR simulation, stress testing and optimization modules that enable clients to manage multi-asset class portfolios, carry out risk budgeting and asset allocation, manager monitoring and performance attribution.

• | Barra Portfolio Manager. Barra Portfolio Manager is an integrated risk and performance platform that is designed to help equity fund managers and their teams gain additional portfolio insight, manage their investment processes more systematically and make faster, more informed investment decisions. The hosted interactive user interface allows users to analyze risk and return, conduct pre-trade what-if analysis across a number of scenarios and construct portfolios using the Barra Optimizer. It also allows users to decompose the risk and attribute the return of their portfolios according to Barra Equity models. The platform supports optional data management services that allow users to outsource the loading and reconciliation of their portfolio and other proprietary data. We also offer many of the benefits of this hosted platform in a locally hosted solution called Barra Aegis.

• | MSCI Analytics Platform. In recent years, we have made significant investments in developing a new MSCI Analytics Platform that will provide clients with a more unified approach for using our content and applications to solve their investment problems. The MSCI Analytics Platform seeks to provide a more holistic client experience by providing better reporting and visualization tools and direct access to capabilities and content currently available through our other Analytics applications, as well as content from other MSCI segments. For example, ESG content has been made available through our MSCI Analytics Platform in response to demand from institutional managers who are looking for ways to integrate ESG into their investment processes.

• | HedgePlatform. HedgePlatform, a reporting service, allows clients that invest in hedge funds, including funds of funds, pension funds and endowments, to measure, evaluate and monitor the risk of their hedge fund investments across multiple hedge fund strategies. We collect position-level information from hedge funds on a monthly basis and provide clients with risk information for each individual hedge fund in which they invest as well as aggregate risk information for their overall portfolio of hedge funds. Clients who use RiskManager to measure the risk of their own holdings can further integrate the positions collected via our HedgePlatform service to allow computation of risk across their entire portfolio, while the confidential and proprietary nature of the underlying hedge fund holdings is maintained. HedgePlatform reports include statistics such as exposure (e.g., long, short, net and gross), sensitivities, scenario analysis, stress tests and VaR analysis.

Geographic Information
 
We currently have branches or subsidiaries in the following locations: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, England, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates and the U.S. See Note 12, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on our revenues and certain assets by geographic area.
Competition
 
Many industry participants compete with us by offering one or more indexes in similar categories. Such indexes vary widely in scope, including by geographic region, business sector and risk category and may be used by clients in a variety of ways in many different markets around the world.  A number of these markets have become increasingly competitive in recent years.
 
10

Among our Index competitors are S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (a joint venture company owned by CME Group, Inc. and CME Group Services LLC and by S&P Global Inc.) and FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of The London Stock Exchange Group PLC.
 
There is also growing competition from asset managers and investment banks that create their own indexes often in cooperation with index providers, which may, among other things, provide some form of calculation agent service; this is especially true for factor indexes, often referred to as “smart beta indexes.” Asset managers, such as WisdomTree and Goldman Sachs Asset Management, manage funds, including ETFs, based on their own proprietary indexes, and many investment banks have launched structured products or created over-the-counter derivatives based on their own proprietary indexes.
 
Many industry participants compete with us by providing one or more similar offerings in a very competitive marketplace for risk management and performance data and analytics.
 
Our Analytics offerings compete with offerings from a range of competitors, including Axioma, Inc., BlackRock Solutions, Bloomberg Finance L.P., and FactSet Research Systems Inc.  Additionally, many of the larger broker-dealers have developed proprietary analytics tools for their clients. Similarly, many investment institutions, particularly the larger global organizations, have developed their own internal risk management analytics tools.
 
We also have a variety of competitors for our other offerings that comprise a smaller portion of our revenues.
 
Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
 
We consider many aspects of our offerings, processes and services to be proprietary. We have registered, among others, “MSCI,” “Barra,” “RiskMetrics” and “RiskManager” as trademarks or service marks in the United States and in certain foreign countries. We will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks, service marks and copyrights as appropriate. From time to time, we also file patent applications to protect our proprietary rights. We currently hold 22 U.S. and foreign patents and have one U.S. patent pending. Additionally, many of our offerings, processes and services require the use of intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our offerings and services. 
 
Although we believe the ownership of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, the implementation of certain measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and our ability to obtain the rights to use intellectual property of third parties are important to our business and contribute in part to our overall success, we do not believe we are dependent on any one of our intellectual property rights or any one license to use third-party intellectual property. For a description of the risks associated with legal protection of our intellectual property and other rights, infringement claims and the ability to obtain or renew licenses for third-party intellectual property, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors— Legal Protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages. Third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights, and third-party litigation may materially adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights” below.
 
Company History
 
On November 15, 2017, MSCI celebrated ten years as a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.  The following is a summary of material events in the Company’s history:

1969 | •Capital Group International pioneered the development of global equity indexes and began licensing its first equity indexes in 1969.
1998 | •We were incorporated in 1998. Our only two shareholders were Morgan Stanley and Capital Group International. 

 11

 
2004 | •In June 2004, we acquired Barra, LLC (formerly Barra, Inc., “Barra”), a provider of portfolio risk analytics tools that launched its first risk analytics products in 1975. This broadened our product range beyond indexes. 
2007 | •In November 2007, we completed our initial public offering. 
2008 | •In April 2008, Capital Group International divested its ownership position. 
2009 | •In May 2009, Morgan Stanley divested its ownership position and we became a fully independent, stand-alone public company. 
2010 | •In June 2010, we acquired RiskMetrics Group, Inc. (“RiskMetrics”), a leading provider of risk management products and services. In addition to this core product line, RiskMetrics owned Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (“ISS”), a pioneer in the development of policy-based proxy voting recommendations and a leading provider of governance products and services. •RiskMetrics also owned Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc. and KLD Research and Analytics (“KLD Research”), whose products have been integrated into our MSCI ESG Research offerings. 
2012 | •In November 2012, we acquired real estate performance measurement group IPD Group Limited (“IPD”). The acquisition of IPD expanded our multi-asset class offerings by facilitating the integration of private real estate assets into our models, as well as adding real estate indexes. 
2014 | •In April 2014, we completed the sale of ISS, which was deemed not to be core to our strategy. •In August 2014, we acquired Governance Holdings Co. (“GMI Ratings”), a provider of corporate governance research and ratings to institutional investors, banks, insurers, auditors, regulators and corporations seeking to incorporate ESG criteria into risk assessment and decision-making. This acquisition enhanced our existing platform of ESG research and tools, allowing us to deliver a more comprehensive suite of ESG data, applications and services.

We had 3,038 and 2,862 employees as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

MSCI ESG Research is a registered investment adviser and must comply with the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and related SEC regulations.
