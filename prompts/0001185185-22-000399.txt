ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview



Mitesco, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), became a publicly-traded company through a reverse triangular merger with Brain Tree International, Inc., a Utah corporation (“BTI”) in 2012. From 2012 through 2015 the Company’s operations were not focused on healthcare services and healthcare technology. Its efforts to enter the healthcare space began in early 2016 with activities aimed at the compounding pharmacy area, and continued with technology solutions including healthcare records applications. In early 2019 we adopted a strategy to develop a network of primary care clinics nationwide. The team is led by individuals who had previously managed a similar situation within a business known as “QuickMedx,” subsequently named “Minute Clinic” that focused on “convenience care clinics.” CVS Corporation acquired the Minute Clinic business in 2006 and began an effort to embed these clinics insider of their retail pharmacy locations. See “https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinuteClinic “. Our approach follows revised version of that business strategy, adopting new technology, locating near residential locations, and leveraging lower cost, and more available healthcare staffing.



We are opening primary care clinics around the United States utilizing the experience, expertise, and training of licensed, advanced degreed registered nurse practitioners (“Nurse Practitioners”). Our clinics provide complete primary care, basic behavioral healthcare, and basic dermatological services for consumers. The medical practice focuses on whole person health and prevention. We seek to create a jointly developed longitudinal care plan with each individual that focuses on the patient’s individual quality of life goals. We personalize care interactions based upon the individuals care style as identified by University of Oregon’s “Patient Activation Measure” a peer reviewed, validated tool also in use by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. We pursue health equity in our practices and are a member of the National Minority Health Association. Our practice accepts most major commercial insurances, Medicare, Medicaid, and self-pay patients. We support pricing transparency and maintain a published price list for self-pay patients.



In addition to the traditional fee-for-service medical care, we offer a variety of services focused on wellness for both individuals and self-funded employers. Our wellness offerings include dermatological services, weight management, nutritional and diabetes coaching as well as offering products such as educational books, vitamins, and essential oils. Most of our wellness products and services are not covered by insurance and are paid for by the consumer at the time the of service. We offer our services both in the clinics as well as via telehealth and seek to facilitate same day and next day appointments for client convenience. Mitesco’s mission is to increase convenience and access to care, improve the quality of care, and reduce cost.



We opened our first primary care clinic “The Good Clinic” in Northeast Minneapolis, Minnesota in February 2021, and have added five additional operating clinics as of the date of this filing for a total of six clinics open and operating at December 31, 2021. We announced leases for two new clinics in the greater Denver, Colorado area. These new locations are expected to open in the second quarter of 2022. We plan to open clinics in residential concentrations of population to enhance the convenience, especially timely due to the changes in community travel patterns resulting from the pandemic. Our clinicians use both telehealth (virtual) and in-person visits to treat and coach the clients along their journey to better health and quality of life. Our clinics are led by Nurse Practitioners that use their license, extensive training, expertise, and empathy to help people remain stable or improve their health. We emphasize wellness, beginning with a clients’ co-developed plan that identifies from where a person is starting and constructs a plan for how they can achieve their goals. The practice uses an integrated health approach that includes an assessment of both the individual’s behavioral and physical health and combines this with their activation level and their goals. The clinic offers wellness coaching, behavioral health care, episodic care, dermatologic services, and supplements. We seek to care for the whole person’s needs.



Like the first clinics opened, we will continue to seek to locate clinics convenient to residential centers. In pursuit of this approach, we intend to continue to expand our relationships with Lennar Corporation and other large-scale developers. While we have no formal relationship with these developers, other than as a tenant, we believe such relationships give us an advantage in recruiting and retaining clients in close proximity to our locations. We believe that our clinics will be viewed as an amenity for the high-rise development in which we are located. We plan to mirror this approach in residential developments in Denver, and in other markets as we expand. We may also seek to grow through the acquisition of existing clinic operations which would be converted into our operating approach.



The Company’s operations are subject to comprehensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it does business. There also continues to be a heightened level of review and/or audit by federal and state regulators of the health and related benefits industry’s business and reporting practices.

The laws and rules governing the Company’s businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules continue to evolve each year and are subject to frequent change. The application of these complex legal and regulatory requirements to the detailed operation of the Company’s businesses creates areas of uncertainty. Further, there are numerous proposed health care, financial services and other laws and regulations at the federal and state level some of which could adversely affect the Company’s businesses if they are enacted. The Company cannot predict whether pending or future federal or state legislation, including fundamental changes to our industry, such as the federal or state governments restructuring the Commercial, Medicare or Medicaid marketplace or the reduction of payments to the Company.



The Company can give no assurance that its businesses, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected, or that the Company will not be required to materially change its business practices, based on: (i) future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations; (ii) the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations, including the laws and regulations described in this Government Regulation section, as they may relate to one or more of the Company’s businesses, one or more of the industries in which the Company competes and/or the health care industry generally; (iii) pending or future federal or state governmental investigations of the Company.



The Company had previously established a strategy to address opportunities in Europe seeking technology solutions, or financing situations, through a Dublin based subsidiary, Acelerar Healthcare Holdings Ltd. After a review of its near-term opportunities in North America, the Board of Directors has determined that any efforts in the European community should be discontinued to focus on the Company’s North American operations. In conjunction with this decision the Company for the period ending December 31, 2021 will take a one-time charge of approximately $12,500 related to the discontinuation and wind down of its European entity.



Operational Overview



During the year ended December 31, 2021, we have focused on establishing medical clinics utilizing nurse practitioners and telemedicine technology under “The Good Clinic” name. Our strategy is to utilize a mix of nurse practitioners and telemedicine technology in clinics to improve patient experiences and outcomes and reduce healthcare costs as compared to other available treatment options.
Our Business and Related Matters



In March 2020, we formed The Good Clinic LLC, a Colorado limited liability company for our clinic business. We entered into an agreement with James Woodburn, Kevin Lee Smith, Michael Howe, and Rebecca Hafner-Fogarty to establish a series of clinics utilizing Nurse Practitioners and telemedicine technology in states where full practice authority for Nurse Practitioners is supported. Full practice authority is the authorization of Nurse Practitioners to evaluate patients, diagnose, order, and interpret diagnostic tests and initiate and manage treatments, including prescribe medications. We issued 4,800 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock to these individuals as compensation. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, these shares were cancelled in consideration of an issuance of 600,000 shares of restricted Common Stock in aggregate, and as a result there are no shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of the date of this filing.



Effective April 6, 2020, the Company entered into four separate Independent Contractor agreements with Dr. James Woodburn, Kevin Lee Smith, Michael Howe, and Dr. Rebecca Hafner-Fogarty, respectively. Pursuant to the Independent Contractor Agreements the four individuals were responsible for all aspects of the development and implementation of the business known as MyCare, LLC., the development of all intellectual property related to MyCare, LLC; the development and execution of the operational plan related to MyCare, LLC; and any other duties assigned by management or the Board of Directors of Mitesco, Inc.



Dr. Woodburn, Mr. Smith and Dr. Hafner-Fogarty were also owners and appointed Managers of Good Clinic (MN), PLLC, and as such provided advice to the business and oversight of the clinical operations of The Good Clinic operations. At no point did either of the four independent contractors provide services for fees in any of their capacities working for any of the entities. Effective June 1, 2021, Messrs. Howe and Smith terminated their Independent Contractor agreements and simultaneously were hired as employees of The Good Clinic, LLC. Dr. Woodburn’s Independent Contractor Agreement was terminated effective August 31, 2021, and effective at that same time he resigned as a Manager of Good Clinic (MN), PLLC and relinquished his ownership interest in that entity.



Recent Developments



The Company had previously established a strategy to address opportunities in Europe seeking technology solutions, or financing situations, through a Dublin based subsidiary, Acelerar Healthcare Holdings Ltd. After a review of its near-term opportunities in North America, the Board of Directors has determined that any efforts in the European community should be discontinued so that it can best focus on its North American operations. In conjunction with this decision the Company for the period ending December 31, 2021, it will take a one-time charge of $12,500 related to the discontinuation and wind down of its European efforts.

The Company entered into a debt-for-equity exchange agreement with Gardner Builders Holdings, LLC (the “Creditor”) on January 7, 2022 (the “Agreement”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company issued shares of restricted common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of MITI (the “Restricted Shares”) to the Creditor in exchange for the Company Debt Obligations, as defined below.



The Agreement settles for certain accounts payable amounts owed by the Company to the Creditor (the “Accounts Payable Amount”) as well as upcoming amounts that will become due between the date of the Agreement and April 1, 2022. The Agreement also settles incurred interest and penalties on the amounts due through January 5, 2022, as well as future interest payments on amounts to be incurred in the first quarter of 2022 (collectively, the “Additional Costs”, and combined with the Accounts Payable Amount, the “Company Debt Obligations”). The Accounts Payable Amount is $500,000, the Additional Costs is $294,912.56 and the conversion price is $0.25. As a result, 3,179,650 Restricted Shares were authorized to be issued. The Company’s Board of Directors approved the Agreement on January 5, 2022.



Target Locations 



We are in the process of identifying strategic new locations for The Good Clinic facilities. We anticipate initial expansion of five to seven clinics in the Minneapolis / St. Paul metropolitan area Minnesota. We then expect, subject to adequate funding, to expand in Colorado and then Arizona, and Florida with a goal of having 50 units operating in the next three years. We are targeting expansion states experiencing a shortage of available primary care providers within the 36 states that support near or fully independent practice by Nurse Practitioners.



Consumer research has clearly identified that consumers want convenience (Becker’s Hospital Review, “What Do You Really Know About Patient Loyalty?”). As such, we are seeking to locate clinics within more residential urban and suburban locations with higher density of population. Like the first clinic, we seek to locate clinics convenient to residential centers. In pursuit of this approach, we intend to continue to expand our relationship with Lennar Corporation and other large-scale developers. While we have no formal relationship with these developers other than as a tenant, we believe such relationships give us an advantage in recruiting and retaining clients in close proximity to our locations.



The Good Clinic facilities are expected to be developed in three sizes. They are planned to be from 3,000 to 3,500 square feet with three to five Nurse Practitioners, from 1,250 to 2,000 square feet with two to three Nurse Practitioners, and small telehealth hubs staffed by a single nurse practitioner. The Nurse Practitioners practicing will be the primary care providers at these clinics. The Good Clinic will offer the following medical services:




▪ | Full-spectrum family practice services;
--+----------------------------------------


▪ | Flu and other vaccines;
--+------------------------


▪ | Advanced Electronic Medical Records (EMR) that enables rapid, accurate and consistent medical documentation and protocols, safety features, follow-up planning and billing information;

Patient Scheduling



We offer scheduling protocols to facilitate our clients’ ability to schedule appointments that meet their busy schedules or to come without appointment when unplanned sickness or injuries occur. For sudden sickness and minor injuries, we provide an alternative to hospital emergency rooms which often have long waits and excessive costs. The Good Clinics will open Monday through Friday from 8 am to 7 pm and Saturday from 9 am to 2 pm. The Good Clinics will provide its patients with the ability to access their practitioners seven days a week through clinic and virtual visits. We plan to offer customized hours and open access as alternatives for business clients seeking occupational services for their employees. We plan to own and lease certain medical equipment.
Connectivity Between Locations



Upon having multiple locations, we plan to have connectivity between the clinics so that our future patients can access their information for treatment or prescriptions at any of our available facilities and online via telehealth. When you work with The Good Clinic, we plan to know who you are and what you want and need.
Serving the Market



We believe there is a looming shortage of primary care providers in the United States. Approximately 23 States in the U.S. allow Nurse Practitioners to operate as fully independent primary care providers. Another 13 allow Nurse Practitioners broad autonomy in providing primary care services. By using Nurse Practitioners, we plan to focus on direct patient care, patient education and helping people to manage their health more effectively. The Good Clinics are designed to improve access to basic affordable primary care and empower Nurse Practitioners to function as healthcare providers. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, Nurse Practitioners are compensated 40% less than their physician counterparts. Additionally, 36,000 Nurse Practitioners (AANP Fact Sheet, https://www.aanp.org/about/all-about-nps/np-fact-sheet graduate each year making the necessary expertise readily available.



Like any consumer-focused business, locating a clinic is one-part art and one-part science. We evaluate concentration of primary care practices within the zip code and examine average wait-times for appointments and ensure the local markets are already using Nurse Practitioners as primary care providers. We are seeking the previous measures to be present in cities with higher population concentrations. We focus on convenience that includes locations near residential centers, adequate parking, good retail visibility in higher traffic areas and the presence of other retail businesses close by.



Billing and Payment



The Good Clinics bills health insurance companies for allowed medical services and accepts payment in cash or credit cards for client selected and non-covered services. We will also explore partnering with local businesses to provide near-site employer clinics for physicals, virus testing, and occupational health services.
Marketing 



We plan to generate business for The Good Clinics through a combination of partnerships with residential developers and local marketing and advertising, direct sales of occupational medical services to companies (flu shots, workers injury treatment services, drug testing, and health promotion programs), public relations efforts with local charities, city and county organizations, hospitals and medical providers, networking and promotional events and open houses. We are using internal marketing including brochures, posters, magazines, health promotion articles, and educational materials that point to our services. Upon having a new patient, we plan to initiate client follow-up and schedule return visits. To assure broad access of insured clients in the medical service area, we plan to participate in contracts with health insurance providers, and the Medicare program, making The Good Clinics services fully reimbursable for its clients.



The Good Clinic is about delivering a convenient individualized care experience built on education, expertise, and empathy. We are the patient’s partner in obtaining quality and affordable medical care. The Good Clinic supports patient care with both in-clinic and telehealth visits to ensure convenience and avoid delays in the care being delivered to keep patients stable and at home.

Healthcare Industry Insight



According to a recent report published by Deloitte which examined the market for 2020 health care expenditures continue to consume an increasing portion of most countries’ economies. In the U.S., health care spending increased 3.9 percent to $3.5 trillion in 2017, and now represents 17.9 percent of the U.S.’ Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”). An aging population and high levels of chronic conditions are contributing to expectations that health care expenditures will continue growing faster than the economy. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) estimates annual U.S. healthcare spending will grow at an average rate of 5.5 percent through 2026 and reach $5.7 trillion, or 19.7 percent of U.S. GDP, by 2026. We believe this trajectory is unsustainable and that health care IT (“HCIT”) may play an important role in facilitating a shift from a high-cost health care system that incents volume to a system that is proactive and incents health, quality, and efficiency.



For this change to occur, we believe traditional fee-for-service (“FFS”) reimbursement models must continue to shift to value-based approaches that are more aligned with quality, outcomes, and efficiency. The shift away from traditional FFS is evident in growth of lives covered under Accountable Care Organizations (“ACOs”). ACOs are groups of hospitals and providers that focus on providing coordinated, high-quality care to Medicare, Medicaid, or commercially insured populations, then share in savings created by lowering the cost of care. According to Leavitt Partners, lives covered under ACOs grew from approximately five million in 2011 to more than 32 million in 2018.



In addition to the increasing number of lives covered under ACOs, the structure of ACOs is evolving to where providers are expected to assume more risk. Currently, most ACO contracts are upside only, which means providers can receive bonuses for good performance, but they assume no downside for underperformance. In 2018, CMS released a rule called “Pathways to Success” that accelerates the period during which providers need to move to ACOs that include both upside bonuses and downside penalties. We believe this shift is important as assumption of risk by providers creates a strong incentive for them to improve care coordination and deliver high quality care at a lower cost.



Another step towards a value-based reimbursement occurred with the passage of The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (“MACRA”),). This reauthorization enacted significant reforms to the payment programs under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule and consolidated three current value-based programs into one.



While each of the different approaches to aligning reimbursement with value will continue to evolve, we believe the trend away from traditional fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursement to clinicians for services performed will continue. We believe this growth in government and private models aligning payment with value, quality and outcomes will drive major changes in the way health care is provided in the next decade, expect a much greater focus on patient engagement, wellness, and prevention. As health care providers become accountable for proactively managing the health of the populations they serve, we expect them to need ongoing investment in sophisticated information technology solutions that will enable them to predict when intervention is needed so that they can improve outcomes and lower the cost of providing care.



The increasingly complex and more clinical outcomes-based reimbursement environment, we believe is also contributing to a heightened demand for revenue cycle solutions and services and a desire for these solutions and services to be more closely aligned with clinical solutions. Over the past several years, there has been a shift in the U.S. marketplace towards a preference for a single platform across inpatient and ambulatory settings. The number of physicians employed by hospitals has increased as hospitals have acquired physician groups, and health systems are recognizing the benefit of having a single patient record at the hospital and the physician office. We believe the smaller providers and regional networks of healthcare providers will be the newest users of the technologies we seek to develop.



While health care providers are showing a preference for a single platform across multiple venues, there is also an increased push for interoperability across disparate systems to address the reality that no patient's record will only have information from a single health care IT system. We believe health information should be shareable and accessible among primary care physicians, specialists, and hospital physicians.

Competition



The market for healthcare solutions including walk-in clinics and telehealth services is intensely competitive. We compete in a highly fragmented primary care market with direct and indirect competitors that offer varying levels of impact for key stakeholders such as patients and employers. Our competitive success is contingent on our ability to simultaneously address the needs of key stakeholders efficiently and with superior outcomes at scale compared with competitors. Competition in our market involves rapidly changing technologies, evolving regulatory requirements and industry expectations, frequent new product and service introductions and changes in customer and patient requirements. If we are unable to keep pace with the evolving needs of patients and continue to develop and introduce new applications and services in a timely and efficient manner, demand for our solutions and services may be reduced and our business and results of operations would be harmed.



We currently face competition in the telehealth industry from a range of companies, including specialized software and solution providers that offer similar solutions, often at lower prices, and that are continuing to develop additional products and becoming more sophisticated and effective. In addition, large, well-financed health systems have in some cases developed their own telehealth tools and may provide these solutions to their customers and patients at discounted prices. The surge in interest in telehealth, and in particular the relaxation of HIPAA privacy and security requirements, has also attracted new competition from providers who utilize consumer-grade video conferencing platforms such as Zoom and Twilio. Competition from large software companies or other specialized solution providers, communication tools and other parties could result in continued pricing pressures, which is likely to lead to price declines in certain product segments, which could negatively impact our sales, profitability, and market share.



We compete with walk-in clinics, such as the CVS Minute Clinic, traditional healthcare providers and medical practices, care management and coordination, digital health, telehealth and telemedicine and health information exchange. Competition in our market involves rapidly changing technologies, evolving regulatory requirements and industry expectations, frequent new product and service introductions and changes in customer and patient requirements. If we are unable to keep pace with the evolving needs of our clients, members and partners and continue to develop and introduce new applications and services in a timely and efficient manner, demand for our solutions and services may be reduced and our business and results of operations would be harmed.



Our business is highly dependent on completing our clinics and gaining patients and clients in our target markets. However, the healthcare market is competitive, which could make it difficult for us to succeed. We face competition in the healthcare industry for our solutions and services from a range of companies and providers, including traditional healthcare providers and medical practices that offer similar services. These competitors primarily include primary care providers who are employed by or affiliated with health networks. Our indirect competitors also include episodic consumer-driven point solutions such as telemedicine as well as urgent care providers. Urgent care providers in the local communities provide services similar to those we offer. Many of our competitors (1) are more established than we are, (2) may offer a broader array of services or more desirable facilities to patients and providers , and (3) may have larger or more specialized medical staffs to admit and refer patients. In the future, we expect to encounter increased competition from system-affiliated hospitals and healthcare companies, as well as health insurers and private equity funded companies seeking to acquire providers, in specific geographic markets. We also face competition for market share in high margin services and for providers and personnel from specialty hospitals (some of which are physician-owned), primary care providers and outpatient centers. Furthermore, some of the clinics and medical offices with which we compete may have access to capital at a lower cost because they that compete with us may be supported by government agencies or not-for-profit organizations supported by endowments and charitable contributions and can finance capital expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt basis.



Our competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories and significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. Further, our current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, or patient requirements and may have the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition. In addition, current and potential competitors have established, and may in the future establish, cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary technologies or services to increase the availability of their solutions in the marketplace. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances may emerge that have greater market share, a larger client or patient base, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, greater marketing expertise, greater financial resources, and larger sales forces than we have, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Our competitors could also be better positioned to serve certain segments of the healthcare market, which could limit our client and patient growth. Considering these factors, even if our solution is more effective than those of our competitors, current or potential client, health network partners and enterprise clients may accept competitive solutions in lieu of purchasing our solution. If we are unable to compete in the healthcare market, our business would be harmed.



 13

 



Competitors may also be better positioned to contract with leading health network partners in our target markets, including existing markets after our current contracts expire. If our competitors are better able to attract patients, contract with health network partners, recruit providers, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities than we are, we may experience an overall decline in client volumes and net revenue. There is no assurance we will be able to compete in the markets in which we plan to operate which could cause you to lose your investment.



Management



We believe that the Company’s management team will remain small in the near term and should consist of a team with experience in 1) health care delivery and insurance, 2) public company accounting and finance, 3) software and systems, 4) brand marketing, 5) law, 6) human resources, and 7) public equities financing. Biographical and other information on our executive officers and directors is set forth in “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers, and Corporate Governance” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Human Capital



We anticipate maintaining a small corporate staff and employ the majority of our human capital in our subsidiaries. As of March 23, 2022, Mitesco employee six people, of which three are corporate officers. Lawrence Diamond serves as our Chief Executive Officer and director; Phillip Keller serves as our Chief Financial Officer and Jenny Lindstrom serves as our Chief Legal Officer. As of March 23, 2022, our subsidiary, The Good Clinic, LLC, employs 21people in professional positions supporting the operations of The Good Clinic. Our clinic operations employ 19 people in Minnesota and Colorado. ,We have partnered with several key vendors that are national in scope to meet the anticipated growth rate for building and opening clinics. We are currently recruiting additional clinical staff to serve the anticipated expanding clinic client demand. The Good Clinic continues to develop an extensive employee training program that will ensure compliance with all federal, state, and local regulations as well as enable the team all have the expertise, knowledge, skills, and training to deliver the full scope of services offered to clients at the clinic, in person and virtually.



Our innovative approach towards delivering primary care is attracting many clinicians wanting to join the team. Additionally, we believe that the reputation of the founders from their work growing Minute Clinic (f/k/a Medix) and their work at schools of nursing and industry and trade associations is helping to deliver many experienced potential employees.



We also use the services of additional advisors and consultants on an as needed basis to perform outsourced tasks. None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.



Research and Development



The research to date for The Good Clinic was primarily conducted by present management of The Good Clinic. Our Board of Directors and management also conducted research and development including accessing third party research reports, competitor analyses, review of prior professional experiences, and interviews with industry experts and potential partners. We did not incur any research and development costs during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Intellectual Property



In August 2020, we applied for trademark protection of “The Good Clinic”, with the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). Our federal trademark registration for the mark THE GOOD CLINIC is on the Supplemental Register, not the Principal Register. The Supplemental Register does not confer the same rights and benefits as the Principal Register.

Government Regulation



The healthcare industry is a highly regulated industry by both federal and state governments. We are subject to other federal and state healthcare laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We operate in a highly regulated and evolving environment with rigorous regulatory enforcement. Any legal or regulatory action could be time-consuming and costly. If we or the manufacturers or distributors that supply our products fail to comply with all applicable laws, standards, and regulations, action by regulatory agencies could result in significant restrictions. Any regulatory action could have a negative impact on us and materially affect our reputation, business, and operations. The U.S. healthcare industry has undergone significant changes designed to improve patient safety, improve clinical outcomes, and increase access to medical care. These changes include enactments and repeals of various healthcare related laws and regulation. Our operations and economic viability may be adversely affected by the changes in such regulations, including: (i) federal and state fraud and abuse laws; (ii) federal and state anti-kickback statutes; (iii) federal and state false claims laws; (iv) federal and state self-referral laws; (v) state restrictions on fee splitting; (vi) laws regarding the privacy and confidentiality of patient information; and (vii) other laws and government regulations.



If there are changes in laws, regulations, or administrative or judicial interpretations, we may have to change our future business practices, or our business practices could be challenged as unlawful, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See the description below for certain of the laws, regulations, or administrative or judicial interpretations that we are currently subject to and the “Risk Factors” section of this prospectus.



The Affordable Care Act



The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “Affordable Care Act” or the “ACA”) in 2010 made major changes in how healthcare is delivered and reimbursed and increased access to health insurance benefits to the uninsured and underinsured population of the United States.



 15

 



Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA as well as recent efforts by the current administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted, which includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Since the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, there have been additional amendments to certain provisions of the ACA, and we expect the current administration and Congress will continue to seek to modify all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. It is uncertain the extent to which any such changes may impact our business or financial condition. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA. In December 2019, a federal appeals court held that the individual mandate portion of the ACA was unconstitutional and left open the question whether the remaining provisions of the ACA would be valid without the individual mandate. We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA and its modification or repeal and replacement has on our business. It is uncertain the extent to which any such changes may impact our business or financial condition.



Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent laws, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. New laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which may materially adversely affect customer demand and affordability for our products and services and, accordingly, the results of our financial operations. Additional changes that may affect our business include the expansion of new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives for physicians under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) which first affected physician payment in 2019. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the Medicare quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement.



Such changes in the regulatory environment may also result in changes to our payer mix that may affect our operations and revenue. In addition, certain provisions of the ACA authorize voluntary demonstration projects, which include the development of bundling payments for acute, inpatient hospital services, physician services and post-acute services for episodes of hospital care. Further, the ACA may adversely affect payers by increasing medical costs, which could have an effect on the industry and potentially impact our business and revenue as payers seek to offset these increases by reducing costs in other areas. Certain of these provisions are still being implemented and the full impact of these changes on us cannot be determined at this time.



Uncertainty regarding future amendments to the ACA as well as new legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs, along with the trend toward managed healthcare in the United States, could result in reduced demand and prices for our services. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments and other third-party payers will pay for healthcare products and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.



Federal Anti-Kickback Statutes



The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a provision of the Social Security Act of 1972 that prohibits as a felony offense the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (1) the referral of a patient for items or services for which payment may be made in whole or part under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, (2) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs or (3) the purchase, lease, or order or arranging or recommending the purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) amended section 1128B of the Social Security Act to make it clear that a person need not have actual knowledge of the statute, or specific intent to violate the statute, as a predicate for a violation. The OIG, which has the authority to impose administrative sanctions for violation of the statute, has adopted as its standard for review a judicial interpretation which concludes that the statute prohibits any arrangement where even one purpose of the remuneration is to induce or reward referrals. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a felony punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines of up to $25,000, civil fines of up to $50,000 per violation, and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. A violation also can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. In addition, pursuant to the changes of the ACA, a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a false claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.

Federal Stark Law



The federal Stark Law, 42 U.S.C. 1395nn, also known as the physician self-referral law, prohibits a provider from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to an entity (including hospitals) providing ‘‘designated health services,’’ if the physician or a member of the physician’s immediate family has a ‘‘financial relationship’’ with the entity, unless a specific exception applies. Designated health services include, among other services, inpatient hospital services, outpatient prescription drug services, clinical laboratory services, certain imaging services (e.g., MRI, CT, ultrasound), and other services that our affiliated physicians may order for their patients. The prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral; and therefore, unlike the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, intent to violate the law is not required. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law contains statutory and regulatory exceptions intended to protect certain types of transactions and arrangements. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute with which compliance is voluntary, an arrangement must comply with every requirement of a Stark Law exception, or the arrangement is in violation of the Stark Law.



Because the Stark Law and implementing regulations continue to evolve and are detailed and complex, while we attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, there can be no assurance that the arrangements entered into by us with affiliated physicians and facilities will be found to follow the Stark Law, as it may be implemented or interpreted. The penalties for violating the Stark Law can include the denial of payment for services ordered in violation of the statute, mandatory refunds of any sums paid for such services, and civil penalties of up to $15,000 for each violation, double damages, and exclusion from future participation in the governmental healthcare programs. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibitions may be fined up to $100,000 for each applicable arrangement or scheme.



Some states have enacted statutes and regulations against self-referral arrangements similar to the federal Stark Law, but which may be applicable to the referral of patients regardless of their payor source and which may apply to different types of services. These state laws may contain statutory and regulatory exceptions that are different from those of the federal law and that may vary from state to state. An adverse determination under these state laws and/or the federal Stark Law could subject us to different liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, or other health care programs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.



Health Information Privacy and Security Standards



The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended, contain detailed requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individually identifiable patient health information (“PHI”) by various healthcare providers, such as medical groups. HIPAA covered entities must implement certain administrative, physical, and technical security standards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of certain electronic health information received, maintained, or transmitted. HIPAA also implemented standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions, including billing and claim collection activities. Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security rules may result in civil and criminal penalties, including a tiered system of civil money penalties that range from $100 to $50,000 per violation, with a cap of $1.5 million per year for identical violations. A HIPAA covered entity must also promptly notify affected individuals where a breach affects more than 500 individuals and report breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals annually. State attorneys general may bring civil actions on behalf of state residents for violations of the HIPAA privacy and security rules, obtain damages on behalf of state residents, and enjoin further violations.



Many states also have laws that protect the privacy and security of confidential, personal information, which may be similar to or even more stringent than HIPAA. Some of these state laws may impose fines and penalties on violators and may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. We expect increased federal and state privacy and security enforcement efforts.



Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Administration Regulations



We are subject to federal, state, and local regulations governing the storage, use and disposal of waste materials and products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for storing, handling, and disposing of these materials and products comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from those hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance coverage, which we may not be able to maintain on acceptable terms, or at all. We could incur significant costs and attention of our management could be diverted to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations. Federal regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration impose additional requirements on us, including those protecting employees from exposure to elements such as blood-borne pathogens. We cannot predict the frequency of compliance, monitoring, or enforcement actions to which we may be subject as those regulations are being implemented, which could adversely affect our operations.

Federal and State Healthcare Laws



We are subject to other federal and state healthcare laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The Health Care Fraud Statute prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, which can be either a government or private payor plan. Violation of this statute, even in the absence of actual knowledge of or specific intent to violate the statute, may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment, or both. The Health Care False Statement Statute prohibits, in any matter involving a federal health care program, anyone from knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up, by any trick, scheme or device, a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any materially false writing or document knowing that it contains a materially false or fraudulent statement. A violation of this statute may be charged as a felony offense and may result in fines, imprisonment, or both. Under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law of the Social Security Act, a person (including an organization) is prohibited from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented to any United States officer, employee, agent, or department, or any state agency, a claim for payment for medical or other items or services where the person knows or should know (a) the items or services were not provided as described in the coding of the claim, (b) the claim is a false or fraudulent claim, (c) the claim is for a service furnished by an unlicensed physician, (d) the claim is for medical or other items or service furnished by a person or an entity that is in a period of exclusion from the program, or (e) the items or services are medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of the law may result in penalties of up to $10,000 per claim, treble damages, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs.



In addition, the office of inspector general (“OIG”) may impose civil monetary penalties against any physician who knowingly accepts payment from a hospital (as well as against the hospital making the payment) as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services provided to Medicare or Medicaid program beneficiaries. Further, except as permitted under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act.



In addition to the state laws previously described, we may also be subject to other state fraud and abuse statutes and regulations if we expand our operations nationally. Many states have adopted a form of anti-kickback law, self-referral prohibition, and false claims and insurance fraud prohibition. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. State laws reach to all healthcare services and not just those covered under a governmental healthcare program. A determination of liability under any of these laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these states. We cannot assure that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws.



Legal Proceedings



From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business.



During March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 crisis, the federal government announced plans to offer loans to small businesses in various forms, including the Payroll Protection Program, or “PPP”, established as part of the Corona Virus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) and administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. On April 18, 2020, the Company’s former President and COO completed and applied on behalf of the Company to Bank of America, NA (“Bank of America”) for a PPP loan, which was subsequently approved. On April 25, 2020, the Company entered into an unsecured Promissory Note (the “Note”) with Bank of America for a loan in the original principal amount of approximately $460,000, and the Company received the full amount of the loan proceeds on May 4, 2020.



On July 21, 2020, Bank of America notified the Company in writing that it should not have received $440,000 of the loan proceeds disbursed under the Note. The Company investigated the terms of the application and discovered its former President had erroneously represented it was refinancing an Economic Injury Disaster Loan when no such loan had been received. Bank of America requested that the Company remit the funds received back to Bank of America. The Company is currently working with Bank of America on a repayment plan. If we are not successful in negotiating repayment terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
