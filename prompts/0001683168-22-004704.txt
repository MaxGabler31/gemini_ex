Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 
We are a dedicated contract development and manufacturing organization (“CDMO”) that provides a comprehensive range of services from process development to Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“CGMP”) clinical and commercial manufacturing, focused on biopharmaceutical drug substances derived from mammalian cell culture. With 29 years of experience producing monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins, our services include CGMP clinical and commercial drug substance manufacturing, bulk packaging, release and stability testing and regulatory submissions support. We also provide a variety of process development services, including upstream and downstream development and optimization, analytical method development, testing and characterization.
 
In October 2021, we announced plans to expand our CDMO service offerings into the rapidly growing cell and gene therapy market. As part of this expansion, we are in the process of constructing a world-class, purpose-built cell and gene therepy development and CGMP manufacturing facility within a building we are leasing in Costa Mesa, California as further discussed in the “Our Facilities” section below. In June 2022, we completed the first phase of our two-phase construction plan of our cell and gene therapy facility, with the opening of our new analytical and process development laboratories. The second phase of construction includes the build out of the CGMP manufacturing suites for our cell and gene therapy facility and is expected to be online in mid calendar 2023.
 
Business Strategy
 
We continue to execute on a growth strategy that seeks to align with the growth of the biopharmaceutical drug substance contract services market. That strategy encompasses the following continuing objectives:

· | Invest in additional manufacturing capacity and resources required for us to achieve our long-term growth strategy and meet the growth-demand of our customers’ programs, moving from development through to commercial manufacturing;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increase operating profit margin to best in class industry standards.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that we are well positioned to address the market for outsourced development and manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals derived from mammalian cell culture, due to the following factors:

· | Expertise in Mammalian Cell Culture Manufacturing: We believe that continued consolidation in the CDMO industry has resulted in a limited number of qualified, agile and independent CDMOs with mammalian cell culture-based biologics development and manufacturing capabilities. The mammalian cell culture production method is highly suitable for manufacturing complex molecules (examples include monoclonal antibodies, next-generation antibodies and recombinant proteins), and we believe the benefits of the mammalian cell culture production method have played a significant role in accelerating the proliferation of biologics therapies. We believe we are well positioned in the industry, given our expertise in mammalian cell culture for biologics manufacturing.

· | Broad Spectrum of Services to Support Customers from Early Stage Development to Commercial: We provide fully integrated and customized biomanufacturing services that support our customers from the early preclinical stage to commercial launch and supply. We believe pharmaceutical companies generally prefer to engage with CDMOs that are able to work with a product throughout its lifecycle and have long-standing track records of regulatory compliance and quality control. Our Process Development, CGMP Drug Substance Biomanufacturing, Project Management, Quality Systems and Quality Control are all supported by modern facilities designed to meet customer needs from early stage development to commercial supply. We differentiate our capabilities through several key criteria: (i) we employ a customer-centric approach and collaborate with our customers to tailor customized development and manufacturing services; (ii) our agile manufacturing and development capabilities allow for rapid responses to shifting production requirements, leading to strong customer satisfaction and retention; and (iii) our single-use bioreactors contribute to enhanced manufacturing efficiency for our customers and reduces our capital spending needs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strong Regulatory Track Record: Historically, developing the expertise to comply with stringent regulatory audits and validation requirements has been a challenge for both pharmaceutical companies and CDMOs, and has been seen as a significant barrier to entry for many CDMOs, as facilities can take years to construct and properly validate. We believe pharmaceutical companies place a premium on working with CDMOs that can ensure a high degree of regulatory compliance, which decreases execution risk. We have a strong regulatory track record, consisting of a 19-year inspection history. Since 2005 we have successfully completed eight pre-approval inspections, including six U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) inspections since 2013, none of which resulted in any Form 483 observations by the FDA. Further, we routinely successfully comply with audits by large pharmaceutical companies.

· | Modern and Optimized Infrastructure: With the ongoing expansion of our Myford facility and the construction of a new purpose-built cell and gene therapy development and CGMP manufacturing facility, as further discussed below, we continue to position our business to capitalize on increasing demand in the biologics manufacturing industry for modular cleanroom space, onsite analytical and process development laboratories and single-use bioreactors. These developments have driven demand among pharmaceutical companies for facilities that can develop and produce pilot scale batches (up to 200 liters) in process development using a process train that matches the single-use bioreactors in CGMP production. With single-use bioreactors ranging from 200 to 2,000 liters, our CGMP Myford North facility is designed to provide our customers with the desired efficiency and flexibility.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Significant Manufacturing Experience with a Proven Track Record: We have 29 years of experience producing monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins, over 17 years of CGMP commercial manufacturing experience and over 14 years of experience with single-use bioreactor technology. We believe this experience, combined with our management team’s and board of directors’ deep experience in the CDMO and pharmaceutical industry, positions us to take advantage of positive long-term industry trends.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
 
We believe we have a significant opportunity to continue to drive organic growth by leveraging our strengths, broadening our capabilities, increasing our capacity and improving our market visibility.

· | Diversify Customer Base: We have taken and continue to take steps to diversify and expand our customer base and have developed marketing and sales strategies designed to drive new customer acquisitions, while also continuing to leverage our existing relationships to support new programs with our existing customers.

· | Expand Process Development Capabilities: In calendar year 2019, we expanded our process development capabilities in order to make our operations more attractive to emerging, mid-sized and large pharmaceutical companies. This expansion included increasing our total available process development and laboratory space, upgrading the infrastructure and equipment within our existing process development laboratories, and implementing new state-of-the-art technologies and equipment (including benchtop bioreactors and pilot scale manufacturing up to 200 liters) designed to facilitate efficient, high-throughput development of innovative upstream and downstream manufacturing processes that transfer directly into our CGMP manufacturing facility. In June 2022, we announced plans to further expand the process development capacity of our mammailian cell culture services by adding new suites within our existing process development laboratory space that will increase our revenue generating capabilities by approximately $20 million, doubling our current capacity. This expansion is expected to be completed by the end of calendar 2022 at an estimated cost of approximately $6 million. We will continue to explore the addition of capabilities and services that bring value to our clients, enhancing their processing design, speeding their time to market and supporting these activities with state-of-the-art analytics.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand Manufacturing Footprint and Enhance Efficiencies: During fiscal 2021, we initiated a two-phase expansion of our Myford facility. The first phase, which was initiated during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and completed in January 2022, expanded the production capacity of our existing Myford facility (“Myford North”) by adding an additional downstream processing suite. The second phase, which was initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and is anticipated to be online during the first calendar quarter of 2023, will further expand our capacity through the build out of a second manufacturing train, including both upstream and downstream processing suites within the south side of our Myford facility (“Myford South”). During fiscal 2022, we initiated the construction of a world-class, purpose-built cell and gene therapy development and CGMP manufacturing facility in Costa Mesa, California. In June 2022, we completed the first phase of our two-phase construction plan with the opening of our new analytical and process development laboratories. The second phase of construction includes the build out of the CGMP manufacturing suites and is expected to be online in mid calendar 2023. Upon completion of the entire build out of our cell and gene therapy facility, we estimate this expansion, combined with our existing facilities and ongoing Myford facility expansion, has the potential to bring our total revenue generating capacity to up to approximately $400 million annually, depending on the mix of projects. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increase Operating Margins: We believe we have the opportunity to drive operating margin expansion by utilizing our available capacity, and implementing continuous process efficiencies.

Our Facilities
 
Our Myford facility, located in Orange County, California, currently consists of 42,000 square feet of leased space within the north side of the Myford facility (“Myford North”) utilizing single-use equipment up to the 2,000-liter manufacturing scale to accommodate a fully disposable biomanufacturing process for products from clinical development to commercial supply. Our Myford North facility includes single-use bioreactors (200-liter to 2,000-liter), two downstream processing suites, quality control labs for environmental and analytical testing, and cell bank cryofreezers. We also lease an additional 42,000 square feet of space within the south side of our Myford facility (“Myford South”). As we announced during fiscal 2021, we are in the process of constructing a second manufacturing train in Myford South, including both upstream and downstream processing suites, warehousing and material storage (including walk-in cold rooms). We expect that this expansion will come online during the first calendar quarter of 2023.
 
Our 12,000 square-foot Franklin facility, which is located adjacent to our Myford facility, includes stainless steel bioreactors (100-liter to 1,000-liter) and single-use bioreactors (200-liter to 1,000-liter), water-for-injection, an autoclave and depyrogenation oven, material storage (including a walk-in cold room) and cell bank cryofreezers.
 
In October 2021, we announced plans to expand our CDMO service offerings into viral vector development and manufacturing services for the rapidly growing cell and gene therapy market. As part of this expansion, we are constructing a world-class, purpose-built cell and gene therapy development and CGMP manufacturing facility within a building we are leasing in Costa Mesa, California (the “Cell and Gene Therapy Facility”). Based on current projections, we expect the entire build out to take up to 18 months at an estimated cost of approximately $65 to $75 million. In June 2022, we completed the first phase of our two-phase construction plan of the Cell and Gene Therapy Facility, with the opening of our new analytical and process development laboratories. The second phase of construction includes the build out of CGMP manufacturing suites, which are expected to be online in mid calendar 2023.
 
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
 
We manufacture CGMP pharmaceutical-grade products for our customers. The process for manufacturing generally uses commercially available raw materials from multiple suppliers, and in some instances, from a single source supplier. We rely on third parties to supply most of the necessary raw materials and supplies for the products we manufacture on behalf of our customers and our inability to obtain such raw materials or supplies may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business” for additional discussion of raw materials supplied by third party vendors for the products we manufacture for our customers.
Regulatory Matters
 
We have a strong and proven regulatory track record, including 19 years of inspection history. To date, we have been successfully audited and qualified by large and small domestic and foreign biotechnology companies interested in the production of biologic material for clinical and commercial use. Additionally, we have been successfully audited by several regulatory agencies, including the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (“ANVISA”), the Canadian Health Authority (“Health Canada”), the California Department of Health and the Australian Department of Health.
 
We are required to comply with the regulatory requirements of various local, state, national and international regulatory bodies having jurisdiction in the countries or localities where we manufacture products or where our customers’ products are distributed. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning research and development, testing, manufacturing processes, equipment and facilities, including compliance with CGMPs, labeling and distribution, import and export, and product registration and listing. As a result, our facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as regulatory bodies of other jurisdictions where our customers have marketing approval for their products including, but not limited to, the EMA, ANVISA, Health Canada, and the Australian Department of Health. We are also required to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as discussed in “Environmental and Safety Matters” below. These regulatory requirements impact many aspects of our operations, including manufacturing, developing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, import and export and record keeping related to customers’ products. Noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements can result in government refusal to approve facilities for manufacturing products or products for commercialization.

Our customers’ products must undergo pre-clinical and clinical evaluations relating to product safety and efficacy before they are approved as commercial therapeutic products. The regulatory authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which our customers intend to market their products may delay or put on hold clinical trials, delay approval of a product or determine that the product is not approvable. The FDA or other regulatory agencies can delay approval of a drug if our manufacturing facilities are not able to demonstrate compliance with CGMPs, pass other aspects of pre-approval inspections (i.e., compliance with filed submissions) or properly scale up to produce commercial supplies. The FDA and comparable government authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which our customers intend to market their products have the authority to withdraw product approval or suspend manufacture if there are significant problems with raw materials or supplies, quality control and assurance or the product is deemed adulterated or misbranded. If new legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or are interpreted or enforced differently, we may be required to obtain additional approvals or operate according to different manufacturing or operating standards or pay additional fees. This may require a change in our manufacturing techniques or additional capital investments in our facilities.
 
The costs associated with complying with the various applicable local, state, national and international regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with such legal requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business” for additional discussion of the costs associated with complying with the various regulations. Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Environmental and Safety Matters
 
Certain products manufactured by us involve the use, storage and transportation of toxic and hazardous materials. Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and the maintenance of safe working conditions. We maintain environmental and industrial safety and health compliance programs and training at our facilities.
 
Prevailing legislation tends to hold companies primarily responsible for the proper disposal of their waste even after transfer to third party waste disposal facilities. Other future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us and could subject the handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants at our facilities to more rigorous scrutiny than at present.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We do not currently own any patents and do not have any patent applications pending in the United States or any foreign countries. However, we have acquired and developed and continue to acquire and develop knowledge and expertise (“know-how”) and trade secrets in the provision of process development and manufacturing services. Our know-how and trade secrets may not be patentable, but they are valuable in that they enhance our ability to provide high-quality services to our customers. We typically place restrictions in our agreements with third-parties, which contractually restrict their right to use and disclose any of our proprietary technology with which they may be involved. In addition, we have internal non-disclosure safeguards, including confidentiality agreements, with our employees.
 
We also own trademarks to protect the names of our services. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as the trademark is used, and in other countries, as long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely.

Segment Information
 
Our business is organized into one reportable operating segment, our contract manufacturing and development services segment. In addition, we had no foreign-based operations and no long-lived assets located in foreign countries as of and for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
 
Customers
 
Revenues have historically been derived from a small customer base. For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we derived approximately 60%, 76% and 63% of our revenues from our top three customers, respectively. Although we continue to expand our customer base, we remain dependent on a limited number of customers for a substantial majority of our revenues. The loss of, or a significant reduction of business from, any of our primary customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Refer to Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional financial information regarding our customer concentration, including the name of significant customers, and geographic location of customers.
Seasonality
 
Our business is not subject to seasonality. However, the timing of customer orders, the scale, scope, mix, and the duration of our fulfillment of such customer orders can result in variability in our periodic revenues.
Backlog
 
Our backlog represents, as of a point in time, future revenue from work not yet completed under signed contracts. As of April 30, 2022, our backlog was approximately $153 million, as compared to approximately $118 million as of April 30, 2021. While we anticipate the majority of our backlog will be recognized during fiscal year 2023, our backlog is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to: the risk that a customer cancels its commitments prior to our initiation of services, in which case we may be required to refund some or all of the amounts paid to us in advance under those canceled commitments; the risk that a customer may experience delays in its program(s) or otherwise, which could result in the postponement of anticipated services; the risk that we may not successfully execute on all customer projects; and the risk of a potential negative impact from the COVID-19 global pandemic, any of which could have a negative impact on our liquidity, reported backlog and future revenues and profitability. 
Competition
 
Our competition in the CDMO market includes a number of full-service contract manufacturers and large pharmaceutical companies that have the ability to insource manufacturing. Also, some pharmaceutical companies have been seeking to divest all or portions of their manufacturing capacity, and any such divested assets may be acquired by our competitors. Some of our significantly larger and global competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources than we do. Moreover, additional competition may emerge and may, among other things, create downward pricing pressure, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Human Capital 
 
As of April 30, 2022, we had 321 full-time employees and 6 part-time employees. All of our employees are based in Orange County, California, with the exception of small number of employees within our sales, marketing and supply chain functions. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with respect to their employment. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 
We consider talent acquisition, development, engagement and retention a key driver to our business success and are committed to developing a comprehensive, cohesive and positive company culture focused on quality and a commitment to the safety and health of our employees, customers and the general public. We accomplish these initiatives through the following:
 
Talent Acquisition and Retention
 
We recognize that our employees largely contribute to our success. To this end, we support business growth by seeking to attract and retain top talent. While the employment market is extremely competitive, particularly for employees with STEM skills (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) due to the large number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies in Southern California and nationally, our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources and tools to recruit highly skilled candidates. These include an employee referral program, a strong and visible reputation in the community and collaborative relationships with local universities and colleges for identifying talented graduates and new graduates, as well as partnering with a regional biotechnology certification program.
 
Such resources and tools have been essential in our ability to attract and retain key personnel throughout all levels of our organization that we believe will play an important role in our success and future growth.
 
Total Rewards
 
We have implemented a total rewards program which we believe allows us to compete for top talent in the Southern California market. Our total rewards philosophy has been to create investment in our workforce by offering competitive compensation and benefits package. We provide all full-time employees with compensation packages that include base salary, annual discretionary incentive bonuses, and long-term equity awards. We also offer comprehensive employee benefits, including life, disability, and health insurance (including medical, dental and vision), dependent care and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, leaves (including medical, maternity and paternity leaves), Employee Stock Purchase Program, a 401(k) plan and educational assistance. It is our expressed intent to be an employer of choice in our industry by providing market-competitive compensation and benefits package.

Health, Safety, and Wellness
 
The health, safety, and wellness of our employees is a priority in which we have always invested and will continue to do so. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs. Program benefits are intended to provide protection and security, so employees can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that may impact their financial well-being. These programs are highlighted in our human resources newsletters.
 
These investments and the prioritization of employee health, safety, and wellness took on particular significance in 2020 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and have remained a continued focus. In response to the global pandemic, in order to protect and support our employees, we promptly implemented health and safety measures that included maximizing personal workspaces, limiting in-person meetings, modifying shift schedules, providing personal protective equipment, and instituting mandatory temperature screening before commencing work. We also supported access to testing by holding voluntary on-site testing clinics for employees. In response to local stay-at-home orders and in alignment with the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we implemented remote-work options for employees who are not essential to our on-site manufacturing operations and restricted non-essential employee travel. We also implemented a diligent track and trace program to identify and temporarily quarantine, with continued pay, employees with actual or suspected exposure to individuals with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19. We continue to monitor and respond to changes in the federal, California and local guidelines and recommendations.
 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
 
We believe a diverse workforce is critical to our success and we are fundamentally committed to creating and maintaining a work environment in which employees are treated fairly, with dignity, decency, respect and in accordance with all applicable laws. We strive to create a professional work environment that is free from all forms of harassment, discrimination and bullying in the workplace, including sexual harassment and any form of retaliation. We are an equal opportunity employer and we strive to administer all human resources actions and policies without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression, past or present military or veteran status, marital status, familial status, or any other status protected by applicable law. Our management team and employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical, and respectful conduct in the workplace. All employees must adhere to a code of business conduct and ethics and our employee handbook, which combined, define standards for appropriate behavior and are annually trained to help prevent, identify, report, and stop any type of discrimination and harassment. Our recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation, and advancement is based on qualifications, performance, skills, and experience without regard to gender, race, or ethnicity.
Training and Development
 
We believe in encouraging employees in becoming lifelong learners by providing ongoing learning and leadership training opportunities. As part of onboarding of new employees, we provide comprehensive training regarding CGMP, environmental, health and safety practices, as well as job function specific training. Many of these training programs are repeated annually and are supplemented by other periodic training programs to maintain and improve employee awareness of safety and other issues. Several times per year we provide supervisory training to newly promoted, or soon to be promoted employees, as well as sponsor more senior employees’ participation in external leadership programs. Additionally, we have applied for training funds through a State of California program supporting the biotechnology industry through the development of future biotech workers. If approved, this program will provide us with additional funds to help supplement our training programs.
 
We have a formal annual review process not only to determine pay and equity adjustments tied to individual contributions, but to identify areas where training and development may be needed. In addition, we strive to provide real-time recognition of employee performance, including through a web-based portal where employees can be nominated for various levels of spot awards and accumulate points towards the purchase of gifts.

Company Culture

We are committed to instilling a company culture that is focused on integrity, transparency, quality and respect. We expect our employees to observe the highest levels of business ethics, integrity, mutual respect, tolerance and inclusivity. Our employee handbook and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics set forth policies reflecting these values and provide direction for registering complaints in the event of any violation of our policies. We maintain an “open door” policy at all levels of our organization and any form of retaliation against an employee is strictly prohibited.
Employee Engagement
 
We believe that in order to be successful, we must build and maintain a relationship with our employees that focuses on transparency and listening to their recommendations. We proactively communicate through employee communication newsletters and hold all-employee meetings. Employee input regarding our organizational climate is solicited at least annually through surveys solicited from all employees. Most recently we used an independent Best Places to Work (BPW) survey and, after assessing the results, followed it up with our own survey to drill down and obtain more data on those areas which the BPW survey indicated we could improve in order to better understand the concerns of our employees. The data from the follow-up survey was then used to develop and implement action items to address the identified key areas for improvement.
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability
 
In fiscal 2022 we engaged a third-party consultant to assist us with our establishment of a more formal environmental, social, governance (“ESG”) and sustainability program. Working with the consultant, and under the oversight of the Corporate Governance Committee, we have embarked on a comprehensive initiative to assess, benchmark and prioritize our ESG and sustainability practices. We anticipate that this work with the consultant will continue and we intend to continue to evolve our disclosures to provide our stockholders and other stakeholders increased visibility into our ESG and sustainability activities.
