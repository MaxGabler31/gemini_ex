Overview
 
We market and sell premium-quality nutritional consumer products in China. Originally, we offered our products and those of third parties which engaged us to market and sell their products directly to consumers at our sales offices, through person—to-person marketing and at events we organize and sponsor, at which, on occasion, representatives of the manufacturers promote their products. In mid-2021 we acquired a chain of pharmacies which we will use to supplement our marketing efforts while maintaining their traditional retail businesses. As part of our direct marketing efforts, we rely on a portion of our clients who market and sell products to others. We offer discounts to distributors who purchase a sufficient quantity of products for the purpose of incentivizing them to distribute products to their friends, family members and others. We also offer clients who purchase significant quantities of products paid vacations, travel and other benefits. Products we sell can now be purchased at our pharmacies, online, direct from our representatives, including at any of the sales offices we maintain in Chengdu and at marketing events held by us.
 
Before promoting a product, we research it and its manufacturer to determine the manufacturer’s reputation as to whether it delivers unadulterated products, and whether there is a basis for claiming the product can deliver the benefits claimed. As part of this effort, a group of our employees use the products and provide feedback based upon their personal experiences. We base our evaluation of products on the assessments received from our employees. We also review and to the extent feasible confirm information and reports received from the manufacturer and distributor. We do not rely upon any other third-parties to independently test products to determine their efficacy.
 
Once we determine to offer a product we seek to purchase large quantities, enabling us to acquire products at prices we believe are below those available to the many smaller distributors that operate in Chengdu.
 
We offer our clients personalized services, including educating them through seminars on the benefits of the products we distribute, maintaining sales offices at which our clients can engage in recreational and social activities where the products we offer are prominently displayed and can be picked up, conducting promotions with representatives of the manufacturers of the products, and encouraging customer loyalty with incentives such as rewards and discounts based upon the quantities of products purchased for individual use or sold to others. We believe our marketing strategy which emphasizes ongoing personal contact and support, coaching and educating our clients as to the benefits of the products we distribute is ideally suited for selling nutritional products and builds confidence in us and customer loyalty to us and the products we sell. We believe this is particularly the case in China where the middle class is growing in size yet, due to lax enforcement and limited laws and regulations, many manufacturers and distributors, particularly those of new and innovative products, are not trusted by consumers. Thus, although our focus is our clients, the manufacturers we work with get the benefit of the trust our clients have placed in us. Consequently, although certain of the products we distribute are produced by a variety of manufacturers, we require the manufacturer or distributor from which we purchase a product to provide us with exclusive distribution rights for an agreed upon time period within a prescribed territory or package the product so that while we are offering a product, it is distinct from products sold to our competitors.

In addition to distributing nutritional products, we also operate the Shangyan Hotel located in the Jinniu District, Chengdu City. The hotel covers more than 8,000 square meters and has a large restaurant that can accommodate 600 people, 6 luxury dining rooms, a 200 square meter music tea house, 13 private tea rooms, 108 guest rooms and other supporting facilities. The hotel is equipped with all modern facilities, including central air conditioning. To accommodate businesses, the banquet hall is equipped with advanced audio-visual equipment and dedicated high-speed wireless Internet to facilitate large group presentations. The staff includes a professional banquet team to ensure the success of any private function or business gathering. A full range of catering services, including Chinese-style boutique Sichuan cuisine are provided in a stylish environment. 
 
In addition to our ongoing operations, we are seeking to acquire interests in additional businesses through opportunities located by our management or presented by persons or firms which desire to take advantage of the perceived advantages of an Exchange Act registered corporation. We are not restricting our search to any specific business, industry, or geographical location and may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature.
 
It is the goal of our management, in particular, our Chairman, Quanzhong Lin, to grow our business and to modify its capital structure in order to qualify for a listing on NASDAQ or the NYSE-American exchange. As part of this effort, we will continue to seek to acquire more businesses and to modify our capital structure as necessary to meet the requirements of the exchange to which we apply for a listing.
 
Our executive offices are at Hongxing International Business Building 2, 14th FL, No. 69 Qingyun South Ave., Jinjiang District, Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, China, and our telephone number is +86-28-8669-1072.
 
Products We Offer
 
We offer a variety of nutritional products and supplements on behalf of our Company and our marketing clients, which change over time in response to the consumer market. We source and purchase all of our products through third party distributors and manufacturers which we carefully research before determining to distribute a product.
Marketing and Sales Strategy
 
We market and sell the products we offer directly to our clients on-line and off-line through our direct marketing efforts, through our chain of retail pharmacies and through those of our clients who act as resellers. We distribute informational videos to our clients on line and make multiple posts on social media daily. Off-line, in addition to distributing products through our pharmacies, we utilize person-to-person marketing to promote and sell products. These personal marketing efforts include hosting educational events and allowing customers to utilize our facilities for social gatherings. We believe our marketing strategy is effective because:

● | we educate consumers about products face-to-face, which we believe is more effective for differentiating our products than using traditional mass-media advertising, particularly when introducing a new product to an older unsophisticated group of consumers in an environment where it is difficult to obtain accurate, reliable product information; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | it provides for actual product demonstrations and use by potential consumers; 
● | it allows us to provide personal testimonials of product efficacy; and 
● | as compared to other marketing methods, we have the opportunity to provide consumers higher levels of service and encourage repeat purchases.

In addition to the retail customers who frequent our pharmacies, we market the products we offer to clients who buy our products directly from us for personal or family consumption and clients who buy, use and distribute our products to others.
 
We offer our clients high-quality, innovative products that provide demonstrable benefits. We attempt to obtain detailed personal information about each of our clients so that we can direct each of them to products that best suit their needs and distribute new products that will appeal to our existing clients. We track the purchases made by every individual who purchases products directly from us. Based upon their purchasing history, we believe a significant majority of our clients purchase the products we sell primarily for personal or family consumption and are not actively pursuing the opportunity we offer to generate income by marketing and reselling products.
 
Our strategy for increasing the number of clients interested in reselling the products we offer and for developing new clients who demonstrate the ability to sell our products to others, is to provide them with compensation, in the form of quantity purchase discounts and other incentives, such as free meals, travel or vacations. We track the amount of products purchased and frequency of purchases by those clients who sell our products to others and reward them when we think it is appropriate
 
We offer our clients a customer satisfaction guarantee. Our sales policy allows for the return of unopened products for cash after deducting certain service and transaction fees. As an alternative to returning a product, customers can exchange a product for another of the same value.
 
Because of restrictions on direct selling and multi-level market in Mainland China, we structured our business model to avoid being placed in either category based on the guidance we received from government officials, our interpretation of applicable regulations, our understanding of the practices of international direct selling companies operating in Mainland China, and our understanding as to how regulators are interpreting and enforcing the regulations.
 
Competition
 
Products
 
The category of nutritional products is very competitive and there are various channels through which such products are marketed to consumers, including direct selling, through the internet, through specialty retailers, pharmacies and discount channels of food, drug and mass merchandisers. We seek to differentiate ourselves by being familiar with our clients and providing a personalized sales experience and focusing on after-sale services where sales employees focus on the consultative sales process through product education and the frequent contact and support that many sales employees have with the clients. From a competitive standpoint, there are many providers and sales outlets of nutritional products in China. We believe that none have effectively combined the product, personal coaching, education and the product access provided by our sales employees and, further, that these efforts are compounded by the peer pressure our clients generate through our organized group sales presentations.
Our Competitive Advantages / Strengths
 
Client Base
 
We have clients who primarily join for a discount on products they consume and introductions to new products they might desire, along with clients who also choose to profit by reselling our products. We currently have around 100,000 clients nation-wide in China. The majority purchase products for personal and family use, while others purchase products for their own use and for distribution to others.
 
When customers purchase the products we offer, information such as the customer’s name and the products purchased, is entered into our computer system, enabling us to develop a profile of more active customers. We do not initially identify a new customer as a preferred client or client distributor but monitor each member’s purchase patterns over time in order to match products to their desires and, eventually, categorize them as a preferred customer or distributor.

We do not pay salaries or commissions to client distributors. It is our practice to offer client distributors discounts on quantity purchases and to reward them through incentives, such as free meals, travel or vacations.,
 
People become our clients for a number of reasons. Many first start out as consumers looking to improve their health through better nutrition and join simply to receive a better price on products they and their families consume and enjoy, while others join so they can resell our products and generate income.
 
Competitive Advantages
 

● | We study the attributes of new products which become available and after researching the benefits which they claim to offer we organize a group of professionals to experience and evaluate the products. Only after we determine that a product is safe, manufactured in conformance with appropriate standards, and has a basis for the claims made, do we recommend a product to our clients. This process ensures our clients get safe, quality products that suit their personal needs and upon which they can rely. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our clients vary greatly in age, background, health and physical condition. We organize activities and events so that we might learn each client’s family background, physical condition and personal health needs, and categorize them into different groups for different products. For example: “cardiovascular and cerebrovascular group”, “bones and joints”, and “heart health.” 
● | We also focus on after-sale services. Due to the large number of clients that are in the middle-to-older aged groups, we have the ability to have products delivered to our clients’ homes by sales personal who can explain the product and demonstrate its use. Our sales personnel are available on a 24-hour basis for questions from clients. Once a client purchases a product, our in-house health advisors will contact him or her to give appropriate professional advice and consultation both over the phone, of face-to-face if needed. 

Our Strategies
 

● | On-site Publicity. We have rooms available at our sales offices throughout Chengdu at which our clients can gather to play cards, enjoy afternoon teas, and engage in other social activities. The products we distribute are displayed at each of our facilities along with appropriate literature and can be purchased by clients and visitors. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Marketing Events. We periodically host small and large-scale marketing events for up to approximately 1000 participants. These events are held at our premises or at restaurants and during travel. At each event products are demonstrated and our personnel explain the benefits of the products and, if available, representatives of the manufacturer or distributor are on hand to respond to questions or make a presentation. We use holidays, such as “National Day,” “New Year Day,” and “Mid-Autumn Day” as opportunities to host large-scale themed activities or events appropriate for the season. 
● | One-on-one marketing. Salespeople will explain and market products to clients one-on-one at our facilities, during marketing events or at a client’s home or office, which gives a personal touch and more detailed explanation of products. 
● | Convenience of Local Pharmacies. Clients who live or work near the pharmacies we have acquired to date and any we might acquire in the future will be able to more conveniently purchase any of our products they may have originally purchased through our direct marketing programs. 

Seasonality
 
In general, there is no seasonality in the sale of nutritional products.

Regulation
 
General
 
The distribution of nutritional products is subject to many laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations and guidance. Such laws, regulations and other constraints exist at the national, provincial and local levels, including regulations pertaining to: (1) the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale and storage of products; (2) product claims and advertising, including direct claims and advertising by us, as well as claims and advertising by manufacturers and distributors of the products we offer, for which we may be held responsible; and (3) taxes. As a distributor, we are subject to only a portion of these laws and regulations. We believe that we are fully compliant with those applicable to our activities.
Products
 
Prior to commencing manufacture or distribution of a product, the manufacturer or distributor may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the national, provincial or local government in China. Although we attempt to determine whether all regulatory requirements have been met, we cannot monitor the manufacture of products and cannot be certain that all applicable regulations are satisfied. Moreover, even if we were to determine that a manufacturer or distributor had the requisite license or certification at the beginning of a relationship, we might not become aware if it were to forfeit any regulatory approvals or fail to adhere to applicable requirements.
Regulation of Nutritional Products.
 
Dietary supplements are subject to regulation by the China Food and Drug Administration. Mainland China has highly restrictive nutritional supplement product regulations. Products marketed as “health foods” are subject to extensive laboratory and clinical analysis by government authorities, and the product registration process in Mainland China generally takes one to two years but, may be substantially longer. We market both “health foods” and “general foods” in Mainland China. As a secondary distributor, we are not in a position to obtain any required license, though we may be held liable if we were to distribute a product which had not been properly tested and registered with the authorities. There is some risk associated with the common practice in Mainland China of marketing a product as a “general food” while seeking “health food” classification. If government officials feel the categorization of a product distributed by us is inconsistent with product claims, ingredients or function, this could end or limit our ability to market such products.
 
As the middle class has grown, the number of manufacturers and distributors of nutritional supplements in China has dramatically increased. Many of these enterprises have often ignored applicable laws and distributed adulterated or inferior products. We believe this has created a marketing opportunity which we have tried to exploit as a trusted source of products on which our clients can rely. To the extent our reputation results from reviewing and testing products prior to distributing them, and then distributing only products determined to be safe, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that the manufacturers and distributors upon which we rely are trustworthy. A failure by any of these third parties could cause substantial damage to our reputation, business and financial results.
 
Direct Selling and Multi-Level Marketing Regulations
 
Direct selling and multi-level marketing are two forms of marketing regulated by various national, provincial and local government agencies in China. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, including “pyramid” schemes, which compensate participants primarily for recruiting additional participants without significant emphasis on product sales to consumers.
 
Under PRC regulations, “direct selling” refers to a type of business mode in which a company recruits door-to-door salesmen to sell products directly to ultimate consumers outside the companies’ fixed places of business. Businesses engaged in “direct selling” are required to obtain a license from the PRC government. A direct selling company is required to provide vocational training for, and conduct an examination of, any sales promoter it recruits, and obtain a certificate for each sales promoter after the sales promoter has passed the examination. A direct selling company is also required, when commencing operations, to deposit RMB 20 million ($2.9 million) in a special account with a designated bank, which deposit is adjusted on a monthly basis to equal 15% of the operator’s sales from direct selling products up to RMB 0.1 billion ($14.5 million).

We do not engage in direct selling activities subject to regulations prevalent in China since we do not employee sales personnel engaged in door-to-door sales outside our place of business.
 
Under PRC regulations, “multi-level marketing” refers to marketing, promotional and sales activities whereby organizers or operators take in new members and compensate each member based upon the number of new members introduced by such member, directly or indirectly, or based upon the level of sales generated by the members introduced by such member. The regulations also prohibit an organizer from requiring new members to deposit a sum of money as a condition to membership, or requiring that members recruit additional members to establish a multi-level relationship. PRC regulations distinguish direct selling from multi-level marketing in that all direct sellers are normally trained by the direct selling company and any direct seller is not allowed to develop new followers or form multiple levels.
 
We are not in the direct selling category or multi-level marketing category since (i) we do not pay salaries or commissions to our member distributors, who decide as a matter of personal preference whether to introduce our products to relatives or friends based on their own personal experience of usage and/or trust of our company’s products; (ii) we do not require individuals to deposit a sum of money to become a member; and (iii) we do not pay members to recruit individuals to join in or to form a multi-level relationship.
 
Nevertheless, the laws and regulations governing direct selling and multi-level marketing may be modified or reinterpreted from time to time, which may cause us to change our business model. Regulations are subject to discretionary interpretation by regulators and governmental authorities. There is often ambiguity and uncertainty with respect to the implication of direct selling and anti-pyramiding laws and regulations.
