ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
(Note: The following constituted our business plan during the 2007, and up to the end of fiscal 2009. After an analysis of the lack of progress, the Company filed a Form 15 with the SEC on July 28, 2010. The new Board has determined to seek other opportunities, and so the following plan is no longer effective.)
 
Business Development
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 25, 1996 as D.W.C. Installations, Inc. We changed our name to The Children’s Internet, Inc. on December 27, 2002. We are a development stage company and currently have no significant revenues, no marketing budget, only minimal assets, and have incurred losses since our inception. The Company is currently authorized to conduct business in California, and as of July 15, 2007 the Company is located in San Ramon, California.
 
The Company was primarily inactive until July 3, 2002 when Shadrack Films, Inc. (“Shadrack”) purchased 2,333,510 newly-issued shares of the Company’s common stock for $150,000, thereby obtaining a majority ownership interest in the Company. Our former Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of our Board of Directors, Sholeh Hamedani, is the sole officer, director and shareholder of Shadrack.

The Company is considered to be a development stage company even though its planned principal operations have commenced, because there have been no significant revenues earned by the Company to date. Through December 31, 2007, the Company devoted the majority of its efforts to activities focused on marketing, on financial planning, raising capital, developing sales strategies and new marketing materials and implementing its business plan. The Company markets, sells, and administers a secure Internet service and safe online community for children. The system, known as The Children’s Internet®, is not owned by the Company, but is owned by a related party, Two Dog Net, Inc. (“Two Dog Net” or “TDN”). Sholeh Hamedani was President of TDN until she resigned on August 1, 2002. Ms. Hamedani, currently owns approximately 10% of the total outstanding shares of common stock of TDN. Ms. Hamedani’s father, Nasser Hamedani, is the Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and majority shareholder of TDN and has been since TDN’s inception in July of 1995.
 
The Company’s marketing, selling and administration rights derive from a Wholesale Sales and Marketing Agreement the Company entered into with Two Dog Net on September 10, 2002, which was amended in February 2005 (the “Licensing Agreement”). The Licensing Agreement gives us the exclusive worldwide right to market, sell, and distribute The Children’s Internet® service and wholesale dial-up Internet service of Two Dog Net. The Licensing Agreement is effective through the year 2013 and includes the ability to obtain five year extensions. It is a condition to the closing of the DSPA (as defined below), that the Licensing Agreement be cancelled and that Two Dog Net transfer to the Company the intellectual property related to The Children’s Internet®.
 
On October 19, 2007, the Company entered into the Definitive Stock Purchase Agreement (the “DSPA” or the “Definitive Stock Purchase Agreement”) between the Company, Shadrack, The Children’s Internet Holding Company, LLC (“TCI Holding”), Sholeh Hamedani, and Richard Lewis, the Company’s Acting Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as reported in the Company’s Form 8-K filed on October 25, 2007. Pursuant to the DSPA, as amended from time to time, TCI Holding has agreed to purchase a controlling interest in the Company. In the event the transaction contemplated under the DSPA is not consummated, a pending suit against the Company by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which is further described below, raises substantial doubt concerning the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate profitable operations in the future by implementing its business plan and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations, and to repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with any certainty at this time. Management plans to provide for the Company’s capital needs over the course of the next year through equity financing, primarily from the contemplated purchase of the Company pursuant to the DSPA, with the net proceeds to be used to fund continuing operations.
 
As a result of streamlining business operations, in January 2008 the Company closed down the co-location facility and Internet hosting services for the Children’s Internet® provided by Evocative Data Center. Since the product was taken offline, sales efforts have been suspended until the Company closes the DSPA. Additionally, the Company has terminated the Children’s Internet® support and content staff during this time. Prior to taking the Children’s Internet® service offline, the product was not being aggressively marketed due to the Company’s lack of resources to promote the product.  The number of users was exceedingly small, and the high cost of hosting was creating a cash drain on the Company which led to the Company’s decision to reduce its overall operating costs until the closing of the DSPA.
