 We specialize in the ownership, leasing and management of secure facilities, processing centers and reentry facilities and the provision of community-based services in the United States, Australia and South Africa. We own, lease and operate a broad range of secure facilities including maximum, medium and minimum-security facilities, processing centers, as well as community-based reentry facilities.

We provide innovative technologies, industry-leading monitoring services, and evidence-based supervision and treatment programs for community-based programs. We also provide secure transportation services domestically and in the United Kingdom through our joint venture GEOAmey PECS Ltd. (“GEOAmey”). As of December 31, 2021, our worldwide operations included the management and/or ownership of approximately 86,000 beds at 106 secure and community-based facilities, including idle facilities, and also includes the provision of reentry and electronic monitoring and supervision services for more than 250,000 individuals, including over 150,000 individuals through an array of technology products including radio frequency, GPS, and alcohol monitoring devices.

GEO operated as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2020.  As a REIT, GEO provided services and conducted other business activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs"). A TRS is a subsidiary of a REIT that is subject to applicable corporate income tax rates and certain qualification requirements. GEO’s use of TRSs permitted us to engage in certain business activities in which the REIT could not engage directly, so long as those activities were conducted in entities that elected to be treated as TRSs under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and enabled GEO to, among other things, provide correctional services at facilities it owns and at facilities owned by its government partners.  A TRS is not subject to the distribution requirements applicable to REITs so it may retain income generated by its operations for reinvestment.  
 On December 2, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors ("Board") unanimously approved a plan to terminate GEO’s REIT election and become a taxable C Corporation, effective for the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result, we are no longer required to operate under REIT rules, including the requirement to distribute at least 90% of REIT taxable income to our stockholders, which provides us with greater flexibility to use our free cash flow. Effective January 1, 2021, we are subject to federal and state income taxes on our taxable income at applicable tax rates and we are no longer entitled to a tax deduction for dividends paid. GEO operated as a REIT for the 2020 tax year, and existing REIT requirements and limitations, including those established by GEO’s organizational documents, remained in place until December 31, 2020. The Board also voted unanimously to discontinue our quarterly dividend payment and prioritize allocating GEO’s free cash flow to reduce debt.  
 As a result of GEO’s Board announcing the change in corporate structure to a taxable C Corporation in fiscal year 2021, we incurred a one-time, non-cash deferred tax charge of approximately $70.8 million during the fourth quarter. We also incurred approximately $29.3 million in incremental income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to the resulting higher corporate tax rate for all of 2021, including a catch-up tax expense of approximately $16.8 million in connection with the first three quarters of 2021.

Business Segments
 We conduct our business through four reportable business segments: our U.S. Secure Services segment; our Electronic Monitoring and Supervision Services segment; our Reentry Services segment and our International Services segment. We have identified these four reportable segments to reflect our current view that we operate four distinct business lines, each of which constitutes a material part of our overall business. We have determined that our previously reportable business segment, Facility Construction and Design, no longer qualifies as a reportable segment as it no longer meets certain quantitative thresholds and has been aggregated with our International Services reportable business segment below.  In addition, we appointed a new Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, during fiscal 2021. Based on changes to the way our chief operating decision maker views the business and financial results used to allocate resources to our electronic monitoring & supervision services operations, along with the growth of the business, we will report the electronic monitoring and supervision services operation as a separate reportable segment. This new segment will be presented as Electronic Monitoring and Supervision Services.  Previously, the electronic monitoring and supervision services operations were included in our GEO Care reportable segment. In addition, the GEO Care reportable segment was renamed Reentry Services and will include services provided to adults for residential and non-residential treatment, educational and community-based programs, pre-release and half-way house programs. We have retroactively restated our segment presentation for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 to reflect these changes.
  Our U.S. Secure Services segment primarily encompasses our U.S.-based public-private partnership secure services business. Our Electronic Monitoring and Supervision Services segment, which conducts its services in the U.S., consists of our electronic monitoring and supervision services. Our Reentry Services segment consists of various community-based and reentry services. Our International Services segment primarily consists of our public-private partnership secure services operations in Australia and South Africa. Financial information about these segments for years 2021, 2020 and 2019 is contained in Note 15 — Business Segments and Geographic Information included in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Recent Developments
 
COVID-19
 We have been closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including how it has impacted those entrusted in our care and governmental partners. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did incur disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic but are unable to predict the overall future impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties related to the pandemic. Refer to further discussion regarding the economic impacts of COVID-19 to our operations in the Outlook section included in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
CEO Succession Plan
       On June 1, 2021, we announced that our Board had determined that it was in the best interests of the Company to implement a succession plan for the Chief Executive Officer position given that our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George C. Zoley, was 71 years old and has served with the Company for approximately forty years. The primary objectives of the Board in initiating a succession plan were to secure Mr. Zoley’s services on a long-term basis to ensure a proper senior management transition, and to retain a new Chief Executive Officer that would succeed Mr. Zoley in that role. This change will allow Mr. Zoley the ability to focus on planning of the Company’s future.
       On May 27, 2021, the Board terminated without cause Mr. Zoley’s existing employment agreement, effective as of June 30, 2021, and entered into a new five-year employment agreement with Mr. Zoley as Executive Chairman, in a modified role and at reduced compensation effective July 1, 2021. The new employment agreement with Mr. Zoley will secure Mr. Zoley’s continuous employment, enabling the Company to continue to benefit from Mr. Zoley’s extensive knowledge and experience, and providing for an orderly transition of senior management. 
 In connection with Mr. Zoley’s termination, GEO and Mr. Zoley entered into a Separation and General Release Agreement as of May 27, 2021 (the “Separation Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Separation Agreement, Mr. Zoley continued to serve as Chief Executive Officer of the Company through June 30, 2021 (the “Separation Date”) and received all accrued wages through the Separation Date. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of Mr. Zoley’s prior employment agreement, Mr. Zoley received payments in the amount of $5,851,555, less any applicable taxes and withholdings, which represented the sum of two (2) years of Mr. Zoley’s base annualized salary and two (2) times Mr. Zoley’s target bonus at that time under GEO’s Senior Management Performance Award Plan. Mr. Zoley’s restricted stock subject to performance-based vesting at the Separation Date shall vest at such time as the performance goals are met if Mr. Zoley is still providing services to GEO under the Executive Chairman Agreement described below. Mr. Zoley received payments of $579,600 for all accrued dividends on his unvested shares of restricted stock. Lastly, Mr. Zoley is entitled to receive certain fringe benefits for a ten (10) year period as set forth in the Separation Agreement, including payment of health insurance premiums under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“COBRA”) for eighteen (18) months and reimbursement of the cost of health insurance coverage for eight and a half (81⁄2) years following the first eighteen (18) months, life insurance, the use of an executive automobile, and personal use of the Company leased 
 4



aircraft for thirty (30) hours per year. In the event of Mr. Zoley’s death within such ten (10) year period, we will continue to provide the fringe benefits to Mr. Zoley’s covered dependents and heirs, and, if applicable to Mr. Zoley’s estate.
 In order to transition the role of Chief Executive Officer to a successor in an orderly manner, our Board determined it was in the best interests of GEO to create a new officer position for the role of Executive Chairman and appointed Mr. Zoley as Executive Chairman, effective as of July 1, 2021. As a result, GEO and Mr. Zoley on May 27, 2021 entered into an Executive Chairman Employment Agreement effective as of July 1, 2021 (the “Executive Chairman Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Chairman Agreement, Mr. Zoley will serve as Executive Chairman assisting the new Chief Executive Officer in his transition, among other duties and responsibilities, and report directly to the Board of Directors for a term of five years ending on June 30, 2026 and subject to automatic renewals for one-year periods unless either the Company or Mr. Zoley gives written notice at least 1 year prior to the expiration of the term. Under the terms of the Executive Chairman Agreement, Mr. Zoley will be paid an annual base salary of $1.0 million and will be eligible to receive target annual performance awards equal to 100% of base salary in accordance with the terms of any plan governing senior management performance awards. Mr. Zoley will also be entitled to receive an annual equity incentive award with a grant date fair value equal to 100% of base salary and subject to a time-based vesting schedule of one (1) year from the date of grant. Additionally, GEO will credit Mr. Zoley’s account balance under the Amended and Restated Executive Retirement Agreement on an annual basis in an amount equal to 100% of his base salary. Lastly, Mr. Zoley is entitled to participate in all benefits and perquisites available to executive officers of GEO.
 The Executive Chairman Agreement provides that upon the termination of the Executive Chairman Agreement by the Company without cause, by Mr. Zoley for good reason or upon Mr. Zoley’s death or disability, Mr. Zoley will be entitled to receive a termination payment equal to two times the sum of his annual base salary and the target bonus. In addition, the unvested portion of any equity award will fully vest and the Company will provide Mr. Zoley and any of his covered dependents and heirs with the executive benefits beginning on the date that they are no longer entitled to the fringe benefits (i.e. health insurance coverage, use of an executive automobile, etc.) under the Separation Agreement until the ten (10) year anniversary of the date of termination of the Executive Chairman Agreement.
 Upon the termination of the Executive Chairman Agreement by GEO for cause or by Mr. Zoley without good reason, Mr. Zoley will be entitled to only the amount of compensation that is due through the effective date of the termination, including the retirement benefit due to him under his executive retirement agreement. The Executive Chairman Agreement contains restrictive covenants, including a non-competition covenant that runs through the three (3) year period following the termination of the executive’s employment, and customary confidentiality and work product provisions.
 Appointment of Jose Gordo as Successor Chief Executive Officer
 In connection with his appointment, Mr. Gordo and GEO entered into an Executive Employment Agreement (the “Employment Agreement”) on May 27, 2021 to provide that Mr. Gordo will be employed by GEO for a three-year term beginning July 1, 2021. Unless the Employment Agreement is sooner terminated, or not renewed, it will automatically extend upon the end of its initial term for a rolling three-year term. Pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement, Mr. Gordo will serve as Chief Executive Officer and report directly to the Executive Chairman. Either Mr. Gordo or GEO may terminate Mr. Gordo’s employment under the Employment Agreement for any reason upon not less than thirty (30) days written notice.
 Under the terms of the Employment Agreement, Mr. Gordo will be paid an annual base salary of $900,000, subject to the review and potential increase within the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee. Mr. Gordo will also be entitled to receive a target annual performance award of 85% of Mr. Gordo’s base salary and will also be entitled to participate in our stock incentive plan and upon the effective date, GEO granted Mr. Gordo an award of 50,000 performance-shares that will vest ratably over a three-year period.
 The Employment Agreement provides that upon the termination of the agreement by Mr. Gordo for good reason, by GEO without cause or upon the death or disability of Mr. Gordo, he will be entitled to receive a termination payment equal to two (2) times the sum of his annual base salary plus target bonus for the fiscal year in which his employment is terminated or, if greater, the target bonus for the fiscal year immediately prior to such termination. GEO will also continue to provide Mr. Gordo and any covered dependents with the Executive Benefits as defined in the Employment Agreement for a period of five (5) years after the date of termination. In the event of Mr. Gordo’s death within such five (5) year period, GEO will continue to provide the Executive Benefits to Mr. Gordo’s covered dependents, and, if applicable to Mr. Gordo’s estate. In addition, the Employment Agreement provides that upon such termination, GEO will transfer all of its interest in any automobile used by the executive pursuant to its employee automobile policy and pay the balance of any outstanding loans or leases on such automobile so that the executive owns the automobile outright. In the event such automobile is leased, the Employment Agreement provides that GEO will pay the residual cost of the lease. In the event GEO does not pay the termination payment by the due date, then any unpaid amount shall bear interest at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum, compounded monthly, until paid. Lastly, all of the outstanding and unvested stock options and restricted stock granted to Mr. Gordo prior to termination will fully vest immediately upon termination; provided, however that any restricted stock that is subject to performance-based vesting shall only vest when and to the extent the Compensation Committee certifies that the performance goals are actually met.

Upon the termination of the Employment Agreement by GEO for cause or by Mr. Gordo without good reason, Mr. Gordo will be entitled to only the amount of compensation that is due through the effective date of the termination. The Employment Agreement includes a non-competition covenant that runs through the three-year period following the termination of the executive’s employment, and customary confidentiality and work product provisions.
 Amended and Restated Executive Retirement Agreement
 GEO and Mr. Zoley entered into on May 27, 2021, and effective as of July 1, 2021, an Amended and Restated Executive Retirement Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Executive Retirement Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Executive Retirement Agreement, upon the date that Mr. Zoley ceases to provide services to the Company, GEO will pay to Mr. Zoley an amount equal to $3,600,000 which shall be paid in cash (the “Grandfathered Payment”). The payment shall be credited with interest at a rate of 5% compounded quarterly (the “Grandfathered Earnings Account”). Additionally, at the end of each calendar year provided that Mr. Zoley is still providing services to GEO pursuant to the Executive Chairman Agreement, GEO will credit an amount equal to $1,000,000 at the end of each calendar year (the “Employment Contributions Account”). The Employment Contributions Account will be credited with interest at the rate of 5% compounded quarterly. Upon the date that Mr. Zoley ceases to provide services to the Company, GEO will pay Mr. Zoley in one lump sum cash payment each of the Grandfathered Payment, the Grandfathered Earnings Account and the Employment Contributions Account subject to the six-month delay provided in the Amended and Restated Executive Retirement Agreement. The balance of the Amended and Restated Executive Retirement Agreement was approximately $5 million at December 31, 2021.
Executive Order
 
       On January 26, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order directing the United States Attorney General not to renew Department of Justice (“DOJ”) contracts with privately operated criminal detention facilities, as consistent with applicable law. Two agencies of the DOJ, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) and the U.S. Marshals Service (“USMS”), utilize GEO’s support services. The BOP houses inmates who have been convicted of federal crimes, and the USMS is generally responsible for detainees who are awaiting trial or sentencing in U.S. federal courts. As of December 31, 2021, GEO has one company-owned facility under direct contract with the BOP, which has a current contract option period that expires on September 30, 2022, and three company-owned/company-leased facilities under direct contracts with USMS, which have current contract option periods that expire between March 31, 2022 and September 30, 2023. These facilities combined represented approximately 8% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.
 
    President Biden’s administration may implement additional executive orders or directives relating to federal criminal justice policies and/or immigration policies, which may impact the federal government’s use of public-private partnerships with respect to secure correctional and detention facilities and immigration processing centers, including with respect to our contracts, and/or may impact the budget and spending priorities of federal agencies, including the BOP, USMS, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is an agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
 
Quarterly Dividends
 As discussed above, on December 2, 2021, GEO’s Board unanimously approved a plan to terminate our REIT status and become a taxable C Corporation, effective for the year ended December 31, 2021.  In connection with terminating GEO’s REIT status, the Board also voted unanimously to discontinue our quarterly dividend payments and prioritize allocating GEO’s free cash flow to reduce debt.  
Senior Credit Facility
 
In 2021, we elected to draw down significant amounts in borrowings under the revolver component of our credit facility as a conservative precautionary step to preserve liquidity, maintain financial flexibility and obtain funds for general business purposes. 
Asset Divestiture
       On July 1, 2021, we completed a divestiture of our youth division, which was organized as a separate independent not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization (“Abraxas”). The divestiture included the sale of certain non-real estate assets in GEO’s Youth division for total consideration of $10 million which was in the form of an unsecured term note receivable (“Term Note”). The Term Note was to mature July 1, 2026 and bore annual interest at 5%. Principal payments of $250,000 were to be due annually each year starting July 1, 2022. After June 30, 2023, an additional payment would have been due equal to 50% of the excess cash flow (as defined in the Term Note) in excess of $1,000,000. The remaining balance was due on the maturity date. Additionally, GEO had provided a $4 million working capital line of credit (“Grid Note”) which was to mature on December 31, 2022 and bore daily interest at prime minus 1%. Each loan under the Grid Note was payable upon the earlier of (i) on demand, (ii) thirty days from the funding date, or (iii) the maturity date. There were no amounts drawn on the Grid Note during 2021. The sale resulted in the assignment of GEO’s youth services management contracts to Abraxas. We retained the ownership of the youth 
 6



services real estate assets and have entered into lease agreements with Abraxas for the six company-owned youth facilities. As a result of the transaction, we recorded a loss on asset divestiture of approximately $4.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 inclusive of a working capital adjustment. On October 15, 2021, GEO signed a letter agreement with Abraxas and another unrelated not-for-profit entity for the settlement of the Term Note and termination of the Grid Note. In accordance with the letter agreement, Abraxas became affiliated with the other unrelated not-for-profit entity and paid GEO $8 million in full settlement of the Term Note on December 31, 2021.
 
Insurance
     On October 1, 2021, GEO formed a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary, Florina Insurance Company, Inc. (“Florina”), to enhance our risk financing strategies. Florina is incorporated in the state of Vermont and is licensed and regulated by the state of Vermont, including with respect to its insurance programs, levels of liquidity and other requirements. GEO began procuring insurance policies to cover deductibles for workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability, medical professional liability and directors and officers’ liability as well as procuring insurance policies for its directors’ and officers’ excess liability and excess medical professional liability through Florina effective October 1, 2021. Florina holds cash and investments in order to meet solvency requirements and meet financial obligations as presented, including an investment portfolio of marketable fixed income and equity securities.
Contract Developments 
 
     On November 1, 2021, we transitioned the operation of our company-owned 600-bed Guadalupe County Correctional Facility to the New Mexico Corrections Department and began a new lease agreement with the State of New Mexico, with a two-year base period and successive two-year renewals through October 2041.
 
     In August 2021 and October 2021, we entered into 5-year contract renewals for our company-owned Broward Transitional Center and our company-owned Aurora ICE Processing Center, respectively. 
 
     Effective October 1, 2021, we entered into a six-month contract extension with the USMS for the 770-bed Western Region Detention Facility in California. The contract with the USMS was operating under a two-year option period which was scheduled to end on September 30, 2021.
 
     On September 30, 2021, we announced that we had entered into a new five-year contract with Clearfield County, Pennsylvania to utilize our company-owned 1876-bed Moshannon Valley Facility in Decatur Township, Pennsylvania. Clearfield County is responsible for detainees under a five-year contract with ICE and expects to use the Moshannon Valley Facility to address its capacity needs.
 
     In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, we received notice that the county intends to take over management of the managed-only George W. Hill Correctional Facility effective April 2022.
 
      On August 18, 2021, we were notified by the BOP that it decided to not exercise the contract renewal option for our company-owned, 1,732-bed Big Springs and the company-owned 1,800-bed Flightline Correctional Facilities in Texas, when the contract base periods expired on November 30, 2021. The contracts for these facilities generated approximately $68 million in combined annualized revenues.
 
      On March 5, 2021, we were notified by the BOP that it decided to not exercise the contract renewal option for the company-owned, 1,940-bed Great Plains Correctional facility in Oklahoma, when the contract base period expired on May 31, 2021. The contract for the facility generated approximately $35 million in annualized revenues. 
 
      On March 15, 2021, we announced that the USMS decided to not exercise the contract renewal option for our company-owned, 222-bed Queens Detention facility in New York, when the contract base period ended on March 31, 2021. The contract for the facility generated approximately $19 million in annualized revenues. 
 
      On March 25, 2021, we were notified by the BOP that it decided to terminate the contract for the county-owned and managed, 1,800-bed Reeves County Detention Center I & II in Texas effective May 10, 2021, which was earlier than the contract base period was scheduled to expire on September 30, 2022. The contract for the facility generated approximately $4 million in annualized revenues. 
 
     We were also not awarded the managed-only contracts for the Bay, Graceville and Moore Haven Correctional and Rehabilitation facilities in Florida during the recent re-bid solicitation process by the State of Florida. We subsequently filed a protest challenging the award of the contracts, and as a result of the protest, we were able to retain the management contract for the Moore Haven Correctional and Rehabilitation facility. Our contracts for the Bay and Graceville Correctional and Rehabilitation facilities have been transitioned to a different operator. The contracts for these two facilities generated approximately $15 million and $25 million in annualized revenues respectively.

Idle Facilities
 In our Secure Services segment, we are currently marketing 9,812 vacant beds with a net book value of approximately $256 million at seven of our idle facilities to potential customers. In our Reentry Services segment, we are currently marketing approximately 1,100 vacant beds with a net book value of approximately $25 million at two of our idle facilities to potential customers. The combined annual carrying cost of these idle facilities in 2022 is estimated to be $22.0 million, including depreciation expense of $12.7 million. We currently do not have any firm commitments or agreements in place to activate these facilities but have ongoing contact with several potential customers. Historically, some facilities have been idle for multiple years before they received a new contract award. The per diem rates that we charge our clients often vary by contract across our portfolio. However, if the nine idle facilities in our Secure Services and Reentry Services segments were to be activated using our Secure Services and Reentry Services average per diem rate in 2021 (calculated as revenue divided by the number of mandays) and based on the average occupancy rate in our facilities for 2021, we would expect to receive annual incremental revenue of approximately $290 million and an increase in annual earnings per share of approximately $.30 to $.35 per share based on our average operating margin. Refer to the discussion under Executive Order and Contract Developments above for discussion of recent developments.
 Quality of Operations
 We operate each facility in accordance with our company-wide policies and procedures and with the standards and guidelines required under the relevant management contract. For many facilities, the standards and guidelines include those established by the American Correctional Association,  (“ACA”). The ACA is an independent organization of corrections professionals, which establishes correctional facility standards and guidelines that are generally acknowledged as a benchmark by governmental agencies responsible for correctional facilities. Many of our contracts in the United States require us to seek and maintain ACA accreditation for our facilities. We have sought and received ACA accreditation and re-accreditation for all such facilities. We achieved a median re-accreditation score of 100% as of December 31, 2021. Approximately 80% of our 2021 U.S. Secure Services revenue was derived from ACA accredited facilities for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have also achieved and maintained accreditation by The Joint Commission at one of our secure service facilities. We have been successful in achieving and maintaining accreditation under the National Commission on Correctional Health Care ("NCCHC") in a majority of the facilities that we currently operate. The NCCHC accreditation is a voluntary process which we have used to establish comprehensive health care policies and procedures to meet and adhere to the ACA standards. The NCCHC standards, in most cases, exceed ACA Health Care Standards and we have achieved this accreditation at 14 of our U.S. Secure Services facilities and at one reentry services location. Additionally, B.I. Incorporated ("BI") has achieved a certification for ISO 9001:2008 for the design, production, installation and servicing of products and services produced by the electronic monitoring business units, including electronic home arrest and electronic monitoring technology products and monitoring services, installation services, and automated caseload management services.
Corporate Social Responsibility
 In September 2021, we issued our third Human Rights and Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) report. The Human Rights and ESG report builds on the important milestone we achieved in 2013 when our Board adopted a Global Human Rights Policy by providing disclosures related to how we inform our employees of our commitment to respecting human rights; the criteria we use to assess human rights performance; and our contract compliance program, remedies to shortcomings in human rights performance, and independent verification of our performance by third party organizations. The Human Rights and ESG report also addresses criteria, based on recognized ESG reporting standards, related to the development of our employees; our efforts to advance environmental sustainability in the construction and operation of our facilities; and our adherence to ethical governance practices throughout our company. The report covers the year ended December 31, 2020 with supporting data from 2018-2020 where possible. The report showcases, among other items, our company wide awareness and training programs, our commitment to a safe and humane environment for everyone in our care, employee diversity, addressing recidivism through our GEO Continuum of Care, our engagement efforts with our stakeholders, oversight and contract compliance, conservation measures and enhanced environmental sustainability efforts.
 The ESG report was prepared with reference to the GRI Standards related to General Disclosures, Economic Topics, Environmental Topics and Social Topics based on the Global Reporting Initiative, or GRI, issued by the Global Sustainability Standards Board and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. GRI is an international independent standards organization created to help business, government and other organizations understand and communicate how their operations affect issues of global importance, such as human rights, corruption and climate change. We have referenced the GRI Standards and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as we have recognized the need for a transparent and disciplined enterprise-wide approach. In our pursuit of this approach, we have begun with the following set of ongoing objectives:
  
• | Provide greater transparency for our stakeholders and the general public with respect to our various efforts in all our facilities aimed at respecting human rights.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhance our ability to flag potential issues in all areas of our operations and compress the time it takes to respond with corrective measures.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 8



 
• | Use widely accepted methodologies for evaluating performance and setting objectives for improvements in corporate governance, corporate social policy, environmental impact and energy conservation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The ESG report may be accessed on our website under "Investors-Latest Reports-Latest ESG Report." The information included in the Human Rights and ESG report is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Business Development Overview
 Our primary potential customers include: governmental agencies responsible for local, state and federal secure facilities in the United States; governmental agencies responsible for secure facilities in Australia and South Africa; federal, state and local government agencies in the United States responsible for reentry services for adult offenders; federal, state and local government agencies responsible for monitoring community-based parolees, probationers and pretrial defendants; and other foreign governmental agencies. We achieve organic growth through competitive bidding that begins with the issuance by a government agency of a request for proposal, or RFP. We primarily rely on the RFP process for organic growth in our U.S. and international secure services operations as well as in our reentry services and electronic monitoring and supervision services business.
 For our facility management contracts, our state and local experience has been that a period of approximately 60 to 90 days is generally required from the issuance of a request for proposal to the submission of our response to the request for proposal; that between one and four months elapse between the submission of our response and the agency’s award of a contract; and that between one and four months elapse between the award of a contract and the commencement of facility construction or management of the facility, as applicable.
 For our facility management contracts, our federal experience has been that a period of approximately 60 to 90 days is generally required from the issuance of a request for proposal to the submission of our response to the request for proposal; that between 12 and 18 months elapse between the submission of our response and the agency’s award of a contract; and that between four and 18 weeks elapse between the award of a contract and the commencement of facility construction or management of the facility, as applicable.
 If the local, state or federal facility for which an award has been made must be constructed, our experience is that construction usually takes between nine and 24 months to complete, depending on the size and complexity of the project. Therefore, management of a newly constructed facility typically commences between 10 and 28 months after the governmental agency’s award.
 For the services provided by BI, local, state and federal experience has been that a period of approximately 30 to 90 days is generally required from the issuance of an RFP or Invitation to Bid, or ITB, to the submission of our response; that between one and three months elapse between the submission of our response and the agency’s award of a contract; and that between one and three months elapse between the award of a contract and the commencement of a program or the implementation of program operations, as applicable.
 The term of our local, state and federal contracts range from one to five years and some contracts include provisions for optional renewal terms beyond the initial contract term. Contracts can, and are periodically, extended beyond the initial contract term and optional renewal terms through alternative procurement processes including sole source justification processes, cooperative procurement vehicles and agency decisions to add extension time periods.
 We believe that our long operating history and reputation have earned us credibility with both existing and prospective customers when bidding on new facility management contracts or when renewing existing contracts. 
  We also plan to leverage our experience and scale of service offerings to expand the range of public-private partnership services that we provide. We have engaged and intend in the future to engage independent consultants to assist us in developing public-private partnership opportunities and in responding to requests for proposals, monitoring the legislative and business climate, and maintaining relationships with existing customers.
 Facility Design, Construction and Finance
 We offer governmental agencies consultation and management services relating to the design and construction of new secure facilities and the redesign and renovation of older facilities including facilities we own, lease or manage as well as facilities we do not own, lease or manage. Domestically, as of December 31, 2021, we have provided services for the design and construction of approximately 58 facilities and for the redesign, renovation and expansion of approximately 80 facilities. Internationally, as of December 31, 2021, we have provided services for the design and construction of 11 facilities and for the redesign, renovation and expansion of two facilities.

Contracts to design and construct or to redesign and renovate facilities may be financed in a variety of ways. Governmental agencies may finance the construction of such facilities through any of the following methods:
  
• | a one time general revenue appropriation by the governmental agency for the cost of the new facility;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | general obligation bonds that are secured by either a limited or unlimited tax levy by the issuing governmental entity; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | revenue bonds or certificates of participation secured by an annual lease payment that is subject to annual or bi-annual legislative appropriations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We may also act as a source of financing or as a facilitator with respect to the financing of the construction of a facility. In these cases, the construction of such facilities may be financed through various methods including the following:
  
• | funds from equity offerings of our stock;
--+------------------------------------------


• | cash on hand and/or cash flows from our operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | borrowings by us from banks or other institutions (which may or may not be subject to government guarantees in the event of contract termination);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | funds from debt offerings of our notes; or
--+-------------------------------------------


• | lease arrangements with third parties.
--+---------------------------------------

 If the project is financed using direct governmental appropriations, with proceeds of the sale of bonds or other obligations issued prior to the award of the project, then financing is in place when the contract relating to the construction or renovation project is executed. If the project is financed using project-specific tax-exempt bonds or other obligations, the construction contract is generally subject to the sale of such bonds or obligations. Generally, substantial expenditures for construction will not be made on such a project until the tax-exempt bonds or other obligations are sold; and, if such bonds or obligations are not sold, construction and therefore, management of the facility, may either be delayed until alternative financing is procured or the development of the project will be suspended or entirely canceled. If the project is self-financed by us, then financing is generally in place prior to the commencement of construction.
 Under our construction and design management contracts, we generally agree to be responsible for overall project development and completion. We typically act as the primary developer on construction contracts for facilities and subcontract with bonded National and/or Regional Design Build Contractors. Where possible, we subcontract with construction companies that we have worked with previously. We make use of an in-house staff of architects and operational experts from various service disciplines (e.g. security, medical service, food service, programs and facility maintenance) as part of the team that participates from conceptual design through final construction of the project. The staff coordinates all aspects of the development with subcontractors and provides site-specific services.
 When designing a facility, our architects use, with appropriate modifications, prototype designs we have used in developing prior projects. We believe that the use of these designs allows us to reduce the potential of cost overruns and construction delays, thus controlling costs both to construct and to manage the facility. Our facility designs also maintain security because they increase the area under direct surveillance by correctional officers and make use of additional electronic surveillance.
 
Competitive Strengths
 Long-Term Relationships with High-Quality Government Customers
 We have developed long-term relationships with our federal, state and other governmental customers, which we believe enhance our ability to win new contracts and retain existing business. We have provided secure management services to the United States Federal Government for 35 years, the State of California for 33 years, prior to the new California law AB 32 that went into effect on January 1, 2020 (aimed at phasing out public-private partnership contracts for the operation of secure facilities within California and facilities outside of the State of California housing State of California inmates), the State of Texas for approximately 34 years, various Australian state government entities for 30 years and the State of Florida for approximately 28 years. These customers accounted for approximately 73% of our consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.
Recurring Revenue with Strong Cash Flow
 Our revenue base has historically been derived from our long-term customer relationships. We have historically been able to expand our revenue base by continuing to reinvest our strong operating cash flow into expansionary projects and through strategic acquisitions that provide

scale and further enhance our service offerings. Our consolidated revenues have grown to $2.3 billion in 202. We expect our operating cash flow to be well in excess of our anticipated annual maintenance capital expenditure needs, which would provide us significant flexibility for the repayment of indebtedness.
 Sizeable International Business
 Our international infrastructure, which leverages our operational excellence in the U.S., allows us to aggressively target foreign opportunities that our U.S. based competitors without overseas operations may have difficulty pursuing. We currently have international operations in Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Our international services business generated approximately $213.8 million of revenues, representing approximately 9% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. We believe we are well positioned to continue benefiting from foreign governments’ initiatives to enter into public-private partnerships for secure services.
Experienced, Proven Senior Management Team
 Our Executive Chairman and founder, George C. Zoley, Ph.D., has provided senior leadership for our Company for 37 years and has established a track record of growth and profitability. Under his leadership, our annual consolidated revenues from operations have grown from $207.0 million in 1997 to $2.3 billion in 2021. Dr. Zoley is one of the pioneers of the industry, having developed and opened what we believe to be one of the first public-private partnership secure services facilities in the U.S. in 1986. Our Chief Executive Officer, Jose Gordo has over 20 years of experience in business management, private equity, corporate finance and business law and a long history of working with GEO. Our Chief Financial Officer, Brian R. Evans, has been with our Company for over 21 years and led our recent dispositions, our review and analysis with the Board of our corporate tax structure, and our financing activities. Our top seven senior executives have an average tenure with our Company of over 10 years.
Business Strategies
 Provide High Quality, Comprehensive Services and Cost Savings Throughout the Corrections Lifecycle
 Our objective is to provide federal, state and local governmental agencies with a comprehensive offering of high quality, essential services at a lower cost than they themselves could achieve. We believe government agencies facing budgetary constraints will increasingly seek to outsource a greater proportion of their correctional needs to reliable providers that can enhance quality of service at a reduced cost. We believe our expanded and diversified service offerings uniquely position us to bundle our high-quality services and provide a comprehensive continuum of care for our clients, which we believe will lead to lower cost outcomes for our clients and larger scale business opportunities for us.
Maintain Disciplined Operating Approach
 We refrain from pursuing contracts that we do not believe will yield attractive profit margins in relation to the associated operational risks. In addition, although we engage in facility development from time to time without having a corresponding management contract award in place, we endeavor to do so only where we have determined that there is medium to long-term client demand for a facility in that geographical area. We have also elected not to enter certain international markets with a history of economic and political instability. We believe that our strategy of emphasizing lower risk and higher profit opportunities helps us to consistently deliver strong operational performance, lower our costs and increase our overall profitability.
Pursue International Growth Opportunities
 As a global provider of public-private partnership secure services, we are able to capitalize on opportunities to operate existing or new facilities on behalf of foreign governments. We have seen increased business development opportunities including opportunities to cross sell our expanded service offerings in recent years in the international markets in which we operate. We will continue to actively bid on new international projects in our current markets and in new markets that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk.
Intellectual Property and Patents
 We have numerous United States and foreign patents issued as well as a number of United States patents pending in the electronic monitoring space. These patents protect our intellectual property rights and provide us with a competitive advantage by seeking to prevent our competitors from duplicating our technology and/or products in the electronic monitoring line of business. The remaining duration of our patents range from 18 months to 20 years.

Such services may be connected to government agency contracts and would be reimbursed by those agencies. Other services are offered directly to offenders allowing them to meet court-ordered requirements and are paid by the offender as the service is provided.

Government Contracts — Terminations, Renewals and Competitive Re-bids
 Generally, we may lose our facility management contracts due to one of three reasons: the termination by a government customer with or without cause at any time; the failure by a customer to renew a contract with us upon the expiration of the then current term; or our failure to win the right to continue to operate under a contract that has been competitively re-bid in a procurement process upon its termination or expiration. Our facility management contracts typically allow a contracting governmental agency to terminate a contract with or without cause at any time by giving us written notice ranging from 30 to 180 days. If government agencies were to use these provisions to terminate, or renegotiate the terms of their agreements with us, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See “Risk Factors — “We are subject to the loss of our facility management contracts, due to terminations, non-renewals or competitive re-bids, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity, including our ability to secure new facility management contracts from other government customers”.
 Aside from our customers’ unilateral right to terminate our facility management contracts with them at any time for any reason, there are two points during the typical lifecycle of a contract which may result in the loss by us of a facility management contract with our customers. 
 19



We refer to these points as contract “renewals” and contract “re-bids.” Many of our facility management contracts with our government customers have an initial fixed term and subsequent renewal rights for one or more additional periods at the unilateral option of the customer. We count each government customer’s right to renew a particular facility management contract for an additional period as a separate “renewal.” For example, a five-year initial fixed term contract with customer options to renew for five separate additional one-year periods would, if fully exercised, be counted as five separate renewals, with one renewal coming in each of the five years following the initial term. As of December 31, 2021, 58 of our facility management contracts representing approximately 29,000 beds are scheduled to expire on or before December 31, 2022, unless renewed by the customer at its sole option in certain cases, or unless renewed by mutual agreement in other cases. These contracts represented approximately 29% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. We undertake substantial efforts to renew our facility management contracts. Our average historical facility management contract renewal rate prior to President Biden’s Executive Order was approximately 90%. The Executive Order has led to several contract non-renewals as previously discussed. We cannot assure you that our customers will in fact exercise their renewal options under existing contracts. In addition, in connection with contract renewals, either we or the contracting government agency have typically requested changes or adjustments to contractual terms. As a result, contract renewals may be made on terms that are more or less favorable to us than those in existence prior to the renewals.
 We define competitive re-bids as contracts currently under our management which we believe, based on our experience with the customer and the facility involved, will be re-bid to us and other potential service providers in a competitive procurement process upon the expiration or termination of our contract, assuming all renewal options are exercised. Our determination of which contracts we believe will be competitively re-bid may in some cases be subjective and judgmental, based largely on our knowledge of the dynamics involving a particular contract, the customer and the facility involved. Competitive re-bids may result from the expiration of the term of a contract, including the initial fixed term plus any renewal periods, or the early termination of a contract by a customer. Competitive re-bids are often required by applicable federal or state procurement laws periodically in order to encourage competitive pricing and other terms for the government customer. Potential bidders in competitive re-bid situations include us, other private operators and other government entities. While we are pleased with our historical win rate on competitive re-bids and are committed to continuing to bid competitively on appropriate future competitive re-bid opportunities, we cannot in fact assure you that we will prevail in future competitive re-bid situations. Also, we cannot assure you that any competitive re-bids we win will be on terms more favorable to us than those in existence with respect to the expiring contract.
 As of December 31, 2021, 19 of our facility management contracts may be subject to competitive re-bid in 2022. These contracts in the aggregate represented approximately 7% and approximately $158 million of our 2021 consolidated revenues. The following table sets forth the number of facility management contracts that we currently believe will be subject to competitive re-bid in each of the next five years and thereafter, and the total number of beds relating to those potential competitive re-bid situations during each period:
 
 
Year | Re-bid | | Total Number of Beds up for Re-bid
-----------+--------+----+-----------------------------------
2022 | | 19 | | 5,142 
2023 | | 12 | | 6,585 
2024 | | 15 | | 2,089 
2025 | | 11 | | 5,155 
2026 | | 14 | | 11,545
Thereafter | | 27 | | 22,808
Total | | 98 | | 53,324

Competition
 We compete primarily on the basis of the quality and range of services we offer; our experience domestically and internationally in the design, construction, and management of public-private partnerships for secure service facilities; our reputation; and our pricing. We compete directly with the public sector, where governmental agencies responsible for the operation of secure services, processing services, community-based services and reentry facilities are often seeking to retain projects that might otherwise become a public-private partnership. In the private sector, our U.S. Secure Services and International Services business segments compete with a number of companies, including, but not limited to: Core Civic; Management and Training Corporation; Emerald Companies; LaSalle Southwest Corrections; Group 4 Securicor; Sodexo Justice Services (formerly Kaylx); and Serco. Our Reentry Services and Electronic Monitoring and Supervision Services business segments compete with a number of different small-to-medium sized companies, reflecting the highly fragmented nature of the community-based services industry. BI’s electronic monitoring business competes with a number of companies, including, but not limited to: G4 Justice Services, LLC and 3M Electronic Monitoring, a 3M Company. Some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do. We also compete in some markets with small local companies that may have a better knowledge of the local conditions and may be better able to gain political and public acceptance.

Human Capital Resources
 
The Company’s key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, the Company’s human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefit, and perquisite programs; enhance the Company’s culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; and evolve and invest in technology, tools, and resources to enable employees at work.
 
At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 15,800 full-time employees. Of our full-time employees, approximately 400 were employed at our corporate headquarters and regional offices and approximately 15,400 were employed at facilities and international offices. We employ personnel in positions of management, administrative and clerical, security, educational services, human resource services, health services and general maintenance at our various locations. 
 Approximately 5,000 and 1,400 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the United States and at international offices, respectively. GEO welcomes the participation of labor unions in our facilities and respects the rights of individual employees to choose whether or not to join labor organizations. We actively participate in the collective bargaining process, negotiate in good faith and maintain excellent working relationships with each of the unions representing our employees. As a result, over the years, GEO has not experienced any significant or major labor actions, such as strikes or work stoppages.
 Training
 GEO has a robust training program for staff at all levels of the organization. Our training of managerial, administrative, and security staff is based on the standards set by the American Correctional Association. Training includes classroom learning, practical exercises, course examinations, and on-the-job training. GEO’s corporate policy also mandates that every new employee receive orientation training prior to undertaking any assignments
 Under the laws applicable to most of our operations, and internal company policies, our correctional officers are required to complete a minimum amount of training. We generally require at least 40 hours of pre-service training before an employee is allowed to assume their duties plus an additional 120 hours of training during their first year of employment in our domestic facilities, consistent with ACA standards and/or applicable state laws. In addition to the usual 160 hours of training in the first year, most states require 40 or 80 hours of on-the-job training. Florida law requires that correctional officers receive 520 hours of training. We believe that our training programs meet or exceed all applicable requirements.
 Our training program for domestic facilities typically begins with approximately 40 hours of instruction regarding our policies, operational procedures and management philosophy. Training continues with an additional 120 hours of instruction covering legal issues, rights of individuals within our care, techniques of communication and supervision, interpersonal skills and job training relating to the particular position to be held. Each of our employees who has contact with individuals within our care receives a minimum of 40 hours of additional training each year, and each manager receives at least 24 hours of training each year.
 At least 160 hours of training are required for our employees in Australia and South Africa before such employees are allowed to work in positions that will bring them into contact with individuals within our care. Our employees in Australia and South Africa receive a minimum of 40 hours of refresher training each year
 With respect to BI and the Intensive Supervision and Appearance Program (“ISAP”) services contract, new employees are required to complete training requirements as outlined in the contract within 14 days of hire and prior to being assigned autonomous ISAP related duties. These employees receive 25 hours of refresher training annually thereafter. Program managers for our ISAP contract must receive 24 hours of additional initial training. BI’s monitoring services maintains its own comprehensive certification and training program for all monitoring service specialists. We require all new personnel hired for a position in monitoring operations to complete a seven-week training program. Successful completion of our training program and a final certification is required of all of our personnel performing monitoring operations. We require that certification is achieved prior to being permitted to work independently in the call center.
 Health, wellness and employee resources
 GEO’s benefit offerings are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of a diverse workforce across businesses and geographies. GEO offers a comprehensive employee benefits program that is competitive for each of the various locations in which we operate across the United States which are designed to develop, attract and retain personnel. The variety of our benefit offerings is designed to provide individual employees with the flexibility to choose coverage options and benefits that best meet their needs and address their priorities. 
 
As the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted communities across the United States and around the world, our employees have also been impacted by the spread of COVID-19. Ensuring the health and safety of our employees and all those in our care has always been our number 
 21



one priority. We advise our employees to remain home if they exhibit flu-like symptoms, and we have exercised and continue to exercise flexible paid leave and paid time off policies to allow for employees to remain home if they exhibit flu-like symptoms or to care for a family member.
 
Career Growth and Development
 
GEO employees and their family members (parent, spouse and child) are eligible to further pursue their educational goals by receiving reduced tuition rates on a variety of accredited on-line degree programs in business, education, healthcare and other disciplines provided at 14 different higher education institutions. A tuition reimbursement program is also available for GEO employees pursuing their education as they work to develop their skills and enhance their job performance. Tuition reimbursement is provided to eligible employees for courses offered by accredited colleges, universities, and secretarial and trade schools. Separately, GEO’s subsidiary, BI, offers an education assistance program to its full-time employees with at least one year of service. Employees who enroll in the program are eligible to receive up to $3,500 a year in tuition reimbursement.
Diversity and Inclusion
 
In all areas of our business, GEO strives to achieve wider racial and ethnic diversity. In 2021, three of our Board seats were held by members of minority communities. Across our organization, under-represented minorities of the United States of America – including African Americans, Hispanic and Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native Hawaiian and Native American/Alaskan – currently account for 61% of our U.S. employees. Minorities comprise 39% of GEO’s corporate workforce, 69% of our facility security staff, and 27% of those serving in management positions as directors or above.
 
Additionally, women comprise an equal portion of GEO’s U.S. workforce and play a significant role in our leadership and management. Women are also involved at the highest levels of our organization. Of the nine members of GEO’s Board of Directors in 2021, two are women. In 2018, the organization 2020 Women on Boards recognized GEO Group as a Winning Company for its commitment to Board diversity. Winning Companies champion Board diversity by having 20% or more of their Board seats held by women. 
 Business Regulations and Legal Considerations
 Many governmental agencies are required to enter into a competitive bidding procedure before awarding contracts for products or services. The laws of certain jurisdictions may also require us to award subcontracts on a competitive basis or to subcontract or partner with businesses owned by women or members of minority groups.
 Certain states, such as Florida, deem correctional officers to be peace officers and require our personnel to be licensed and subject to background investigation. State law also typically requires correctional officers to meet certain training standards.
 The failure to comply with any applicable laws, rules or regulations or the loss of any required license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our current and future operations may be subject to additional regulations as a result of, among other factors, new statutes and regulations and changes in the manner in which existing statutes and regulations are or may be interpreted or applied. Any such additional regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Insurance
 The nature of our business exposes us to various types of third-party legal claims, including, but not limited to, civil rights claims relating to conditions of confinement and/or mistreatment, sexual misconduct claims brought by individuals within our care, medical malpractice claims, product liability claims, intellectual property infringement claims, claims relating to employment matters (including, but not limited to, employment discrimination claims, union grievances and wage and hour claims), property loss claims, environmental claims, automobile liability claims, contractual claims and claims for personal injury or other damages resulting from contact with our facilities, programs, electronic monitoring products, personnel or individuals within our care, including damages arising from an escape of an individual in our care or from a disturbance or riot at a facility. In addition, our management contracts generally require us to indemnify the governmental agency against any damages to which the governmental agency may be subject in connection with such claims or litigation. We maintain a broad program of insurance coverage for these general types of claims, except for claims relating to employment matters, for which we carry no insurance. There can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all claims to which we may be exposed. It is our general practice to bring merged or acquired companies into our corporate master policies in order to take advantage of certain economies of scale.
 On October 1, 2021, GEO formed a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary, Florina Insurance Company, Inc. (“Florina”), to enhance our risk financing strategies. Florina is incorporated in the state of Vermont and is licensed and regulated by the state of Vermont, including with respect to its insurance programs, levels of liquidity and other requirements. GEO began procuring insurance policies to cover deductibles 
 22



for workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability, medical professional liability and directors and officers’ liability as well as procuring insurance policies for its directors’ and officers’ excess liability and excess medical professional liability through Florina effective October 1, 2021. Florina holds cash and investments in order to meet solvency requirements and meet financial obligations as presented, including an investment portfolio of marketable fixed income and equity securities.
 We currently maintain a general liability policy and excess liability policies with total limits of $70.0 million per occurrence and $90.0 million total general liability annual aggregate limits covering the operations of U.S. Secure Services, Reentry Services and Electronic and Supervision Services. We have a claims-made liability insurance program with a specific loss limit of $40.0 million per occurrence and in the aggregate related to medical professional liability claims arising out of correctional healthcare services. We are uninsured for any claims in excess of these limits. We also maintain insurance to cover property and other casualty risks including, workers’ compensation, environmental liability, cybersecurity liability and automobile liability.
 For most casualty insurance policies, we carry substantial deductibles or self-insured retentions of $4.0 million per occurrence for general liability and $5 million per occurrence for medical professional liability, $2.0 million per occurrence for workers’ compensation, $2.5 million per occurrence for directors and officers’ liability and $1.0 million per occurrence for automobile liability. In addition, certain of our facilities located in Florida and other high-risk hurricane areas carry substantial windstorm deductibles. Since hurricanes are considered unpredictable future events, no reserves have been established to pre-fund for potential windstorm damage. Limited commercial availability of certain types of insurance relating to windstorm exposure in coastal areas and earthquake exposure mainly in California and the Pacific Northwest may prevent us from insuring some of its facilities to full replacement value.
 With respect to operations in South Africa and Australia, we utilize a combination of locally-procured insurance and global policies to meet contractual insurance requirements and protect us. In addition to these policies, our Australian subsidiary carries tail insurance on a general liability policy related to a discontinued contract.
 Of the insurance policies discussed above, our most significant insurance reserves relate to workers’ compensation, general liability and auto claims. These reserves, which include Florina’s reserves and GEO’s legacy reserves, are undiscounted and were $74.2 million and $78.9 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in Accrued Expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We use statistical and actuarial methods to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such factors as historical frequency and severity of claims at each of our facilities, claim development, payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services and unpredictability of the size of jury awards. We also may experience variability between our estimates and the actual settlement due to limitations inherent in the estimation process, including our ability to estimate costs of processing and settling claims in a timely manner as well as our ability to accurately estimate our exposure at the onset of a claim. Because we have high deductible insurance policies, the amount of our insurance expense is dependent on our ability to control our claims experience. If actual losses related to insurance claims significantly differ from our estimates, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.
 International Operations
 Our international operations for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the operations of our wholly-owned Australian subsidiary and South African Custodial Management Pty. Limited, our consolidated joint venture in South Africa, which we refer to as SACM. In Australia, our wholly owned subsidiary, GEO Australia, currently manages three facilities. We operate one facility in South Africa through SACM. See Item 7 for more discussion related to the results of our international operations. Financial information about our operations in different geographic regions appears in Note-15 Business Segments and Geographic Information in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K.
Business Concentration
 Except for the major customers noted in the following table, no other single customer made up greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues for these years.
 
 
Customer | 2021 | | | 2020 | | 2019
-------------------------------------------------+------+----+---+------+----+-----
Various agencies of the U.S. Federal Government: | | 58 | % | | 56 | % | 53 | %

 
Credit risk related to accounts receivable is reflective of the related revenues. The margins on our federal contracts are above the company average due to the fact that they are for company-owned facilities.
