Under Delaware laws, the founders incorporated the Company on January 21, 2016, as Forex Development Corporation. On February 27, 2018, the Company changed its name to FDCTech, Inc. The name change reflects the Company’s commitment to expanding its products and services in the online trading technology for OTC online regulated brokers. The Company provides customizable, innovative, and cost-efficient financial technology (‘fintech’) and business solutions to legacy financial services companies in the online regulated brokerages, wealth management, and cryptocurrency businesses (“customers”).

Covid-19
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic throughout the United States. While the initial outbreak concentrated in China, it spread to several other countries, including Russia and Cyprus, and reported infections globally. Many countries worldwide, including in the United States, have significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including temporary closure of businesses, severe restrictions on travel and the movement of people, and other material limitations on the business. These measures have resulted in work stoppages, absenteeism in the Company’s labor workforce, and other disruptions. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our operations will depend on future developments. These developments are highly uncertain. We cannot predict them with confidence, including the duration and severity of the outbreak and the actions required to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact. In particular, the continued spread of the coronavirus globally could adversely impact our operations and workforce, including our marketing and sales activities and ability to raise additional capital, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operation results.
