 ITEM 1.       BUSINESS
 Overview
 We are a leading provider of innovative, application-specific semiconductors and embedded systems that provide the key building blocks of Internet of Things (IoT) edge devices operating on networks worldwide. Our broad portfolio of semiconductor and embedded technologies are optimized for connected IoT devices used in industrial, consumer, communications and medical applications. Through expert design, systems expertise and proprietary intellectual property, we enable our customers to differentiate their systems where it matters most for IoT: longer battery life, greater reliability, higher performance, integrated intelligence and lower cost. Through our solutions, we enable seamless access to data and control of ‘things’ in the connected world. 
 ‘Internet of Things’ describes the technology paradigm that infuses intelligence and connectivity in the physical world to transform human experience and enhance business outcomes. The ability to integrate sensing and control technologies with communication functions is allowing ordinary objects to interact with their environment and communicate in a broad network. The Internet connected people together, and IoT is connecting things.  IoT transformation is occurring across many segments from consumer markets to healthcare to the broad industrial segment. 
 We have deep experience across a variety of technologies used in IoT deployments in many segments.  Our products are shipping in a broad range of connected products from smart utility meters to wearable fitness trackers and medical monitors to home automation and building control systems to satellite communications and fleet management. 
 Our customers use our broad portfolio of products and systems to design and build solutions within their own end markets. Our products are designed to deliver system performance and cost advantages to the end customers in their IoT deployments. These products can be classified into three broad groups:  Application Specific Non-Volatile Memory, Embedded Systems, and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). 
 Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) is a key component in every system design. It sits at the core of every system and stores critical programs and data, controls how the system boots, and affects overall performance. We design and deliver ultra-low power, smart NVM devices that enable a new class of connected applications. We sell our NVM devices directly to leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs) who select our memories because of their distinct advantages for specific applications. Unlike commodity NVM devices, our value-add products are designed with the target system requirements in mind, enabling significant improvements in system performance and power consumption. 
 Our Embedded Systems offerings consist of edge devices (chips for communication and control), edge-gateways (for bridging between networks), and software and management tools to manage the deployment of these solutions. Our solutions are used by a wide array of OEMs and system integrators across a broad spectrum of Industrial IoT markets.
 With our Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) and intellectual property (IP) solutions, we help our customers who include OEMs, service providers, semiconductor vendors, and systems houses to design more optimized solutions for their end-markets. We complement their in-house system application knowledge and combine our IP with theirs to design and deliver exclusive, custom chips. By shrinking customers’ systems into custom ASICs, we are able to significantly cut their product unit costs, while boosting their product performance, reliability and providing product differentiation and protection. We combine our expertise in chip design and supply chain management to deliver finished products that help customers optimize their bills of materials (BOMs) and electronic system designs. We receive non-recurring engineering (NRE) revenue for designing each ASIC along with license fees for any of our IP which is incorporated into the ASIC, and once the customer transitions to production, we supply the actual ASICs for the life of the product. Our ASIC team has completed over 200 successful chips designed in a broad range of applications. Our

custom ASICs, which are capable of integration with our embedded offerings, enables Adesto to provide unique future differentiation for our Industrial IoT (“IIoT”) customers. 
 The IIoT is a key area for Adesto, and this is where our solutions converge to provide unique value. The IIoT refers to communities of rules-based, self-directed devices that reside in commercial or industrial environments and operate with little or no human interaction. These devices are found in environments that are often harsh in nature (e.g., extreme temperature, vibration, noise, humidity, dust) with intermittent connectivity. Specialized requirements of the IIoT include non-compromising control capability, proven reliability, hardened security, and product longevity. Unlike the consumer IoT, the IIoT has many business logic and mission critical requirements and long product lifecycles. The nature of evolving commercial and industrial environments means that IIoT systems must integrate decades of existing and in-service infrastructure that is already deployed in the field. When these solutions are connected, they generally communicate with protocols developed over many years which are often dedicated to specific applications. In IIoT deployments, new systems which require utilizing Internet Protocol (TCP/IP based networks) must interoperate with systems running mature operational technology protocols such as LonWorks, BacNet and Modbus. We believe that bridging this gap is an opportunity for Adesto. 
 In addition to the IIoT, significant markets for our ASIC and IP solutions include the communications market – both wireless and wireline and certain consumer segments. The emergence of new communications standards including 5G, next-generation DSL, as well as the demand for broader, cheaper satellite broadband access, coupled with the need to provide security of information are just a few of the emerging trends that will drive demand for new high-performance, highly reliable, and highly integrated solutions that can be facilitated by an ASIC.
 We were originally incorporated in California in January 2006, and reincorporated in Delaware in October 2015. We completed our initial public offering, or IPO, of common stock in October 2015. Prior to 2018, our business was solely focused on designing and delivering application-specific NVM products.  In May 2018, we completed the acquisition of S3 Asic Semiconductors Limited, or S3 Semiconductors, a provider of analog, mixed-signal and radio frequency (“RF”) custom ASICs and IP cores. This transaction formed the basis of our ASIC business.  In September 2018, we completed the acquisition of Echelon Corporation, a pioneer in developing open-standard control networking platforms. This transaction formed the basis of our Embedded Systems business.  These acquisitions have changed our business profile significantly. We now offer a broad array of semiconductor and embedded systems products that provide powerful advantages to our IoT customers. Our solutions go far beyond memory devices and include application-specific semiconductors for communication and control at the edge of IoT, smart gateways, network management platforms and tools for our customers to deploy our solutions within their businesses. We believe there is unique value to be gained as we look to future roadmaps that leverage combined solutions.
 Our principal executive offices are located at 3600 Peterson Way, Santa Clara, California 95054 and our main telephone number is (408) 400‑0578. We also have regional offices in China, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Portugal, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. Our website is www.adestotech.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated into, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.

 Memory Products
 Most IoT edge and other electronic systems require NVMs to store executable firmware, update this firmware over the air (OTA) and log important data collected at the edge for future upload into the cloud. Our NVM products are created with specific features in mind and improve performance while dramatically reducing energy consumption and extending battery life. Reliability, enhanced security, product longevity and system cost are other decision factors for all customers, and particularly for IIoT applications. We optimize each product family for specific applications such as Execute-in-Place operation, datalogging and battery-operated devices.  
 Our products allow for greater efficiency than competing commodity NVM products in storing small packets of data for the IoT. This simplifies the microcontroller operation for data-logging, enables dramatic increases in battery life and enhances the reliability of the flash memory components. By incorporating power management features in our NVM products, we enable our customers to reduce the number of components and the overall footprint of their systems, thereby lowering the total cost of their systems. Some of our products can significantly improve system performance and power consumption by enabling the use of intelligent design to accelerate data handling capability between microprocessor and memory components. 
 Adesto’s value-add NVM products include:
 DataFlash. Our DataFlash family is specially designed for data-logging applications such as smart meters, industrial and home automation sensing, health and fitness tracking. This family features byte-write capability and integrated Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), simplifying and minimizing the associated software stack. Offloading the MCU also reduces the overall system energy consumption.
 Fusion Serial Flash. Our Fusion Serial Flash family pioneered wide voltage operation and ultra-deep power down modes which allows battery operated devices to be designed more cost effectively and maximize the battery life. These devices are designed for use in a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications including wearables, IoT edge products and RF modules. 
 EcoXiP. Our EcoXiP double data rate (DDR) Octal interface product family represents a new generation of non-volatile memory products ideal for execute-in-place (XiP) applications in embedded IoT systems. Unlike other NVM devices which are primarily in sleep mode, EcoXiP is intended to be active during system operation.  EcoXiP features enable significant reduction in operating power while improving processor performance. EcoXiP’s unique concurrent read and write feature reduces required memory size for Over-the-Air (OTA) updates and offers designers flexibility for future firmware code-size increases.  A proprietary pre-fetching scheme to optimize throughput is another key performance innovation. EcoXiP also offers best-in-class power management features.
 MavriqCM. Our MavriqCM is an application specific NVM device intended specifically for mobile camera modules. Technology-enabled fast write speeds enabled by unique technology reduce camera module calibration time during the manufacturing process, thereby increasing manufacturing efficiency and reducing cost. MavriqCM is an extremely low-power device with significantly improved reliability during low voltage operation, an important requirement for any mobile device. 
 In addition to value-add and application-specific memories, Adesto offers high-quality Standard Serial Flash devices with industry standard features to store boot or program code with a low-pin-count standard serial interface. Adesto’s Standard Serial Flash products are used in a variety of applications including smart home applications, consumer electronics, and industrial applications which demand quality and performance.

 Adesto offers a variety of advanced package options for most of its product line. These include wafer-level Chip Scale Package (CSP) for very small footprint applications and Known Good Die (KGD) for incorporation into System-in-Package (SiP) and Multi-Chip Module (MCM) solutions. 
 Embedded Systems Solutions
 Our embedded components, modules, edge servers and software enable OEMs and system integrators to quickly develop IIoT devices for their end users. With Adesto’s embedded solutions, OEMs, application developers, and integrators can rapidly build innovative and interoperable solutions that meet the unique requirements of the IIoT, such as automation and control, industrial-strength reliability, and scalability. Our solutions enable customers to reduce energy consumption, capital and operating costs, and maintenance; more accurately control business-critical conditions; establish a platform for additional networked applications; and collect data for better asset utilization, increased efficiencies, and powerful predictive analytics. We categorize our products in a three-tier architecture: an edge device tier, an edge server tier, and a management tier. 
 Edge Device Tier. Products in the edge device tier include chips, Systems on Chips (SoCs), and protocol stacks for control and communications which are embedded in Industrial IoT devices such as load controllers, lighting ballasts, meters, and thermostats to enable them to act as peers working together to collect data and take cooperative action. These individual devices are managed by edge servers, such as our SmartServer™ IoT edge server. 
 Edge Server Tier. At the edge server tier, various control technologies and protocols are unified and supervised so that local decisions can be made at the device tier levels. An example of an edge server is the SmartServer™ IoT. Other products in this tier include the i.LON 700 edge router and network interface. In general, these products southbound to control protocols such as LonWorks technology, BACnet, and Open Smart Grid Protocol (OSGP) and northbound to remote clients, web applications, and cloud services through an IP interface. They feature open APIs for control and IoT use cases.
 Management Tier. At the management tier, our solutions connect the edge server tiers to enterprise software / cloud / information technology solutions, so business rules can be established for the control system, and operational data can be archived for later analysis. Products in this tier include the IzoT Net Server and Commissioning Tool which enable IoT network deployment, the SmartServer IoT Central Management System (CMS) which allows devices connected to the SmartServer to be easily accessed, and application programming interfaces (APIs) for developers and integrators to create custom solutions.
 Analog, Mixed-Signal and RF ASIC and IP Products
 We provide analog, mixed-signal and RF ASICs and IP blocks, and manage every aspect of supplying high-quality devices to our customers. 
 Full Custom ASICs. Our custom ASICs are analog-intensive mixed-signal solutions that provide OEMs with many advantages, often enabling them to reduce bill-of-materials costs by 80% or more while creating smaller systems with fewer components. In addition, custom ASICs can provide systems with significant performance enhancements, lower power consumption, greater reliability and less risk of obsolescence.

 For our ASIC products, our customers include tier-one satellite operators such as Inmarsat and Iridium, industrial customers such as Flowserve, and wireless access customers. Initial revenues are achieved during the design phase of the ASIC when our engineering teams are working closely with our customers to architect and implement the most effective ASIC solution which will meet the customers’ requirements. Each ASIC project is underpinned by a specific contract covering the scope of the ASIC development, the NRE fees and any applicable IP license fees. The NRE and IP license fees are payable upon the successful achievement of project milestones as defined in the contract.
 Sales
 We sell our products through our worldwide sales organization and through our channel of representatives and distributors. We organize our sales resources by region, within which sales personnel may work directly with large OEM customers. We have sales personnel covering the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa. 
 We also work closely with select partners who lead in their markets to demonstrate to potential customers the value of our combined solutions. This includes microcontroller vendors, cloud providers, system integrators, and others.
 We work directly with customers to have our NVM devices designed into and qualified for their products, which we refer to as design wins. Although we maintain direct sales, support and development relationships with our end customers, most of our NVM products are sold to end customers through our distribution partners.
 We sell our embedded platform to OEMs and system integrators in the building, lighting, and industrial controls markets directly and through distribution worldwide. These efforts are supported with application engineering, technical support, and industry experts working out of the U.S. as well as China, Japan, South Korea, India, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Regional sales personnel work directly with large OEM customers such as Honeywell, Schneider, Siemens, Trane, and others.
 Our IP products are sold to third parties primarily through our Design & Reuse web portal and through representatives located in the United States and Asia.  In certain cases we are able to upsell to complete ASIC delivery by leveraging our IP.
 Manufacturing
 Semiconductor Manufacturing
 For our semiconductor products including edge devices, ASICs and NVMs, we employ a fabless manufacturing business model and rely on third-party suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including fabrication, assembly and testing. Our fabless business model allows us to leverage the expertise of industry-leading suppliers in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability and testing, and avoid the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating such manufacturing operations. These suppliers also are responsible for procurement of raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we are able to focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing and customer support.
 We do not have a guaranteed level of production capacity from any of our suppliers’ facilities for the production of our products. We carefully qualify each of our suppliers and their subcontractors and processes to ensure they meet our standards for quality and reliability.
 Wafer Fabrication. We currently manufacture the majority of our semiconductor product at United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) in Taiwan. In addition to UMC, we use other foundries including XMC, a foundry in Wuhan, China, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) based in Shanghai, China, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) in Taiwan, X-Fab in France, Winbond Corporation in Taiwan and others.

 Assembly, Testing and Wafer Probe. We maintain multiple sources for assembly and final testing of our products. Amkor Technology, Inc. in Taiwan, Korea and the Philippines, Deca Technologies in the Philippines, as well as Greatek Electronics Inc. in Taiwan currently provide substantially all of our assembly and final test services for our NVM products. Our wafer probing is performed by King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd. in Taiwan. Assembly of our ASIC products is done through Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) in Taiwan. We continually monitor the manufacturing and testing of our products at all of our contractors to ensure that our manufacturing and testing procedures are properly implemented. Based on industry standard requirements, we perform reliability stress testing on the products that we produce and sell. Through this testing, we can detect and accelerate the presence of defects that may arise over the life of a product. As part of our total quality assurance program, our quality management system has been certified to ISO 9001:2115 standards. Our foundry, assembly and test vendors are also ISO 9001 certified.
 System-Level Manufacturing
 We use design and manufacturing services from third parties where it reduces our costs and takes advantage of consolidated purchasing power. We outsource all of our system-level manufacturing and limit our internal supply chain activities to quality inspection, system integration, custom configuration, final testing, and order fulfillment. We maintain work in process and finished good inventory in order to quickly respond to customer orders placed with relatively short delivery schedule.
 For products requiring board level manufacturing, we utilize both third-party ODMs and contract electronic manufacturers (CEMs). CEMs procure component level materials and assemble, test, and inspect the final products to our design specifications. Our ODM vendors perform the same services as CEMs but also provide design services to our product requirements. 
 Research and Development
 We believe that our continued success depends on our ability to both introduce improved versions of our existing solutions and to develop new solutions for the markets that we serve. We have made and intend to continue to make investments in product development, while implementing strategies for overall product development cost reduction where appropriate. As we continue with product and technology development, we will file the appropriate patent disclosures to protect our innovation and enhance our intellectual property position. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had a core team of 142 engineers involved in research and development primarily located in our research and development design center at our headquarters in Santa Clara (California), Dublin (Ireland), Cork (Ireland), Prague (Czech Republic), and Lisbon (Portugal). For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our research and development expense was $20.3 million, $13.6 million and $15.4 million, respectively. 
 Marketing
 Our marketing efforts focus on two key elements: awareness and demand generation/sales enablement. From an awareness perspective, we seek to generate visibility and credibility of our brand, the products and solutions that we offer, and the capabilities and benefits that they bring. Our marketing program comprises press releases, advertising, collateral, published technical and thought-leadership papers, newsletters, and customer case studies describing the benefits our customers are seeing from implementing our solutions. We also participate in industry events and trade shows, speak at relevant industry conferences, and are continually enhancing our global websites.
 Marketing also focuses on making it easier for our sales teams and partners to sell our solutions. We do this through a variety of demand generation and sales enablement activities such as webinars/seminars, lead-generation from our participation at industry exhibitions and conferences, and the production of focused selling tools. We also actively participate in LonMark® International, an association directly focused on the adoption of our embedded systems

products. We enable our sales teams through a systematic pipeline management process, whereby prospects are identified, qualified, and tracked, with the expectation that a portion of these opportunities are ultimately closed.
 Competition
 We operate in the highly competitive global embedded electronics market as well as the semiconductor memory and ASIC markets. We expect competition to increase and intensify as more and larger companies enter our markets. Increased competition could result in price pressure, reduced profitability and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue and operating results. NVM
 Our NVM competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of commodity NVM products to companies specializing in other alternative, emerging memory technologies. Our primary competitors in the NVM market include Macronix International Co. Ltd., Micron Technology, Inc., Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, Winbond Electronics Corp., and several China based suppliers who primarily cater to the local markets. Among these large memory suppliers, we compete primarily on an overall value proposition and not on a product or technology basis. We expect competition in our current markets to increase in the future as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter these markets. Embedded Systems
 Our key competitors for our Smart Transceiver SoCs include established companies which make wireless and wired communications transceivers and modules such as Semtech, Maxim Integrated Products, STMicroelectronics, Texas Instruments, and Tridium. We also see competition from embedded control companies like Freescale Semiconductor and Intel Corporation. In addition, the market has attracted and will continue to attract well-funded, venture-backed start-up companies. Key industry standard and trade group competitors include BACnet, KNX, DALI, DeviceNet, HART, Profibus, ZigBee, and the ZWave Alliance.  ASIC
 Our custom ASIC competition comes from a range of custom ASIC and design service providers both small and large including Global Unichip Corp. (GUC), eASIC (acquired by Intel Corporation in 2018), Faraday, Open-Silicon (now SiFive), eSilicon and Ansem. A range of large diverse semiconductor companies including Microsemi (a Microchip company), On Semiconductor, Socionext, Megachips, Toshiba, and others also provide ASIC design services and support. We have transitioned from a design services model to a full turn-key ASIC supply model, which enables us to compete favorably. We also have unique relationships with foundries and deep supply chain expertise. Our broad mixed-signal and RF IP portfolio together with our embedded mixed-signal ASIC design expertise enables us to sustain a competitive advantage.
 IP Products
 We compete against large companies that offer a broad range of analog and mix-signal IP cores, including electronic design automation (“EDA”) companies such as Cadence Design Systems and Synopsys. We also see competition from smaller dedicated providers of specific categories of IP cores such as data converters. We expect competition to continue, but believe we compete favorably in this market by providing high-quality, highly reliable 

 
  9

 
products that are easy to integrate into designs, with highly responsive and experienced customer support directly from our design engineers.
 Competitive Factors
 Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including industry and general economic trends. Many of our competitors are substantially larger, have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support and other resources, are more established than we are, and have significantly better brand recognition and broader product offerings which may enable them to better withstand adverse economic or market conditions in the future. In each of our markets, our competitors include both small companies as well as some of the largest companies in the electronics industry, operating either alone or together with trade associations and partners. To maintain and improve our competitive position, we must keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers and continue to develop and introduce new products, features, and services in a timely and efficient manner. Our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving embedded and semiconductor markets depend on several factors, including:
· | the price and features of our products such as adaptability, scalability, functionality, ease of use, the ability to integrate with other products, and conformance with established industry standards;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of our semiconductor products, as measured by speed, energy consumption and other factors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the ease of implementation of our products by customers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | the strength of our customer relationships;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | our customer service and support;
--+----------------------------------


· | our products’ cost effectiveness for the total solution relative to that of our competitors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our ability to anticipate changes in customer requirements and to develop new or improved products that meet these requirements in a timely manner;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our market awareness and product reputation; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | warranties, indemnities, and other contractual terms.
--+------------------------------------------------------

  We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors.
 Additionally, while our embedded product implementations are proprietary to Adesto and are often protected by unique, patented processes, key technologies such as LonWorks and IzoT are open, meaning that many of our basic control networking patents are broadly licensed without royalties or license fees. For instance, all of the network management commands required to develop software that competes with our IzoT Net Server software are published. As a result, our customers are capable of developing hardware and software solutions that compete with many of our products.
 Government Regulation 
 Many of our products and the markets and industries in which they are used are subject to U.S. and foreign regulation as well as local, industry-specific codes and requirements. For example, the power line medium, which is the communications medium used by some of our products, is subject to special regulations in North America, Europe, and 

 
  10

 
Japan. In general, these regulations limit the ability of companies to use power lines as a communication medium. In addition, some of our competitors have attempted to use regulatory actions to reduce the market opportunity for our products or to increase the market opportunity for their own products. We have resisted these efforts and will continue to oppose competitors' efforts to use regulation to impede competition in the markets for our products. Our business might also be affected by other regulatory factors, including public utility commission or similar approvals and government mandates. This could lead to an extension of the sales cycle or even cancellation of a customer's order.
 In addition, the market for our products might experience a movement toward standards-based protocols driven by governmental action. To the extent that we do not adopt such protocols or do not succeed in achieving adoption of other protocols we use as standards or de facto standards, sales of our products might be adversely affected. The adoption of voluntary standards or the passage of governmental regulations that are incompatible with our products or technology could limit the market opportunity for our products, which could harm our revenues, results of operations, and financial condition.
 Intellectual Property

Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third-party copying and use. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections. As of December 31, 2018, we held 154 patents that expire at various times between January 2019 and March 2037 and had 41 U.S. patent applications pending. We also held 43 foreign patents that expire at various times between November 2019 and March 2034 and had 44 foreign patent applications pending.
 We seek to file for patents that have broad application in the semiconductor and embedded systems industries and that would provide a competitive advantage. However, there can be no assurance that our pending patent application or any future applications will be approved, that any issued patents will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties, or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property, or disclose such intellectual property or trade secrets, or that we can effectively protect our intellectual property.
 In addition to the intellectual property that we developed, we have acquired and licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in our products. In January 2007, we entered into a license agreement with Axon Technologies Corp. Pursuant to this license agreement, we have rights in Axon’s patents and trade secrets covering, among other things, Axon’s programmable metallization cell, or PMC, technology, which is a component of our Conductive Bridging Random Access Memory, or CBRAM, technology. This license provides us with broad rights to use and sub-license this technology, and we have the exclusive right to make, have made by authorized foundries or integrated device manufacturers, use, sell, lease, offer for sale, and import products covered by Axon’s licensed patents and trade secrets in certain fields of use. The license will last for the lifetime of the licensed patents, which currently ends in September 2026. We pay a royalty for use of the licensed intellectual property in our products. In July 2012, we purchased certain flash memory product assets from Atmel Corporation. As part of the asset purchase, Atmel granted us non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable licenses to its patent portfolio for development of flash memory products. In December 2017, we entered into a license agreement with TowerJazz Panasonic Semiconductor Company. The license is for two years and is a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable license to use and evaluate certain TowerJazz technologies.
 We also hold several trademarks in the United States and select foreign countries, many of which are registered, including Adesto, the Adesto logo, Echelon, the Echelon logo, Lumewave by Echelon, LumInsight, LonBuilder, LonTalk, LonWorks, Neuron, LON, LonPoint, LonMaker, IzoT, LNS, LonManager, Digital Home, and NodeBuilder.
