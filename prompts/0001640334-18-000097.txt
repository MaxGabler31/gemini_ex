ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
We were incorporated in Colorado on June 21, 2010 as Vanguard Energy Corporation (Vanguard) and until June 2014 were involved in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties in southeast Texas. We were never able to earn a profit and in January of 2013 we began investigating the possibility of selling our oil and gas properties. The sale of our oil and gas properties represented the sale of substantially all our assets in June of 2014.
 
On August 19, 2014, a 100-for-1 reverse split of our common stock became effective.
 
The following history of events describes how the current entity Solar Quartz Technology Corporation acquired its subsidiary Solar Quartz Technologies Limited and all entities described below other than Vanguard were entities under common control. 
 
On June 20, 2016, SQTNZ agreed to acquire Solar Quartz Technologies Pte. Ltd., A Singapore Corporation, (SQTSG) in a transfer of shares or a swap for 122 shares (100%). SQTSG (formerly known as Auzsolar Pte. Ltd.) held ownership of quartz mineral rights.
 
On October 1, 2016, Australian Oil and Gas Holdings, Inc., our parent company, (AOGH), (formerly known as Anasazi Energy Corporation (ANSZ) and subsequently known as Solar Quartz Technologies, Inc. (SQTI)), entered into a Reorganization and Stock Purchase Agreement and acquired Solar Quartz Technologies Limited., a New Zealand Corporation, (SQTNZ). AOGH issued 201,182,000 shares (95%) in exchange for 100% of SQTNZ shares outstanding.
 
On July 1, 2017, Vanguard acquired SQTNZ from SQTI in a share exchange wherein Vanguard issued 213,402,755 new shares of common stock to SQTI in exchange for 122 (100%) of the common shares of SQTNZ. The assets acquired in this exchange were reflected in our financial statements at SQTI’s historical cost basis of $30,000 as it was considered an acquisition of assets from entities under common control. The issuance of these shares was equivalent to 95% of the Company’s shares issued, as we committed to issue an additional 10,021,224 shares to those holders of our common stock immediately prior to the acquisition. These actions resulted in a total of 224,426,229 shares outstanding.

SQTNZ is a corporation that has no prior business activity other than being the title owner of the exclusive mining and development rights for two High Purity Quartz (HPQ) deposits known as Quartz Hill (represented by leases ML 30235, ML 30236 and ML 30237) and White Springs (represented by leases ML 30238 and ML 30239) located in North Queensland, Australia. 
 
HPQS is an essential primary material for the manufacture of: Photo-Voltaic (PV) solar panels; Semiconductors; all High-end Electronic products; Fiber Optical cables; Halogen Lamps; HD and LCD television screens; and Epoxy Mounding Compounds (EMC).
 
On July 1, 2017 the Company increased its authorized common shares to 500,000,000 and its authorized preferred shares to 10,000,000.
 
On July 1, 2017 the company acquired all of the shares of Solar Quartz Technologies Limited, a company incorporated in New Zealand (“SQTNZ”). These shares were purchased from Solar Quartz Technologies, Inc. (“SQTI”). We subsequently changed our name to Solar Quartz Technologies Corporation in Colorado and with FINRA, and have also been cleared by FINRA to use the new trading symbol SQTX. The Company issued 213,402,755 new shares of common stock to SQTI in exchange for 122 (100%) of the common shares of SQTNZ. The issuance of these shares was equivalent to 95% of the Company’s shares issued, after we committed to issue an additional 10,021,224 shares of common stock to those who were holders of our common stock immediately prior to the acquisition which is required by the share exchange agreement. The Company does not anticipate any further reorganization of its common stock. We will soon seek to apply to trade on the more senior OTCQX exchange or NASDAQ.
 
SQTNZ is a corporation that has had no prior business activity other than being the title owner of the exclusive mining and development rights for two High Purity Quartz (HPQ) Silica deposits known as Quartz Hill (represented by leases ML 30235, ML 30236 and ML 30237) and White Springs (represented by leases ML 30238 and ML 30239) located in North Queensland, Australia. Based on resource estimates prepared by I J M Wilson, ARMIT, MAIG, a qualified resource appraiser in Australia. The report is prepared in accordance with standards established by Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC Code 204). Together they contain deposits more than 15 million tons of 99% pure High Purity Quartz which is feedstock in high demand in the marketplace to be used in the production of High Purity Quartz Sand (HPQS) according to independent professional reports. Based on preliminary, independent valuation studies, previously obtained offers for purchase of the raw materials and other considerations, the Board of Directors of the Company believes the net present value of the recoverable deposits to be $530 million. The valuation of these resources included consideration of the current market prices for the materials when mined and processed, the cost of mining the quartz deposits, mining recovery obligations, pre-processing and refining costs on a net present value basis.
 
HPQS is an essential primary material for the manufacture of: Photo-Voltaic (PV) solar panels; Semiconductors; all High-end Electronic products; Fiber Optical cables; Halogen Lamps; HD and LCD television screens; and Epoxy Mounding Compounds (EMC).
 
We are currently seeking capital to build a Stage One pre-processing plant to upgrade the HPQ to be salable as feedstock for numerous high-tech applications. We plan to build that plant in Townsville, Queensland, Australia, near the mine site, and a major port city where the upgraded product can easily be shipped to any user in the world. The current estimated cost of the facility, plus operating capital, is approximately $10 million to build and equip. Upon completion, that facility will be able to upgrade the raw quartz to a High Purity Quartz Sand (HPQS) purity level that meets significant world-wide demand for use in the manufacture of PV Solar Panels, Semiconductors and all high-end electronics.
 
Following the establishment of the pre-processing plant, we plan to build a further upgrading (Stage Two) facility to upgrade the feedstock SQS from the pre-processing facility to HPQS, the highest quality quartz sand necessary for the manufacture of PV solar panels and high-end electronics, fiber optics, semiconductors and microchips. That facility will cost an additional $28 million to construct and equip it with necessary equipment including a “clean room” and commercial scale processing equipment. HPQS is an essential material for this process and the essential solar crucibles, as it shares the same element (Si) and is almost non-reactive, assuring high quality silicon ingots. Apart from this, High Purity Quartz (HPQ) also finds primary applications in advanced lighting, telecom, optic and microelectronics industries. HPQS Powers are required for epoxy molding compound (EMC) used in manufacture of most semiconductors, and the fast-growing auto electronics sector.

Active discussions with potential end user investor partners who can provide the funding for both facilities is ongoing.
