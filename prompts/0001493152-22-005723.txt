ITEM 1: BUSINESS
Our History
 
Our company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in September 2006 and was formerly known as Greenmark Acquisition Corporation (“Greenmark”). On February 7, 2011, Greenmark Acquisition Corporation and Powerdyne, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Powerdyne Nevada”), merged with Greenmark as the surviving company. Powerdyne Nevada was formed in February 2010 in the State of Nevada and had limited operations until the time of its combination with Greenmark. As part of the merger, Greenmark Acquisition Corporation, the surviving entity, changed its name to Powerdyne International, Inc. prior to the merger, Greenmark did not have any ongoing business or operations and was established for the purpose of completing mergers and acquisitions with a target company, such as Powerdyne Nevada.
Overview
 
We are a company which intends to provide independent, cost-effective, green electrical power through the leasing of electrical generation equipment under the trade name “PDI Power Solutions”. Our PDI Power Solution is a customized green power solution which allows a client to operate either independent of the grid (forming his own micro-grid) with the option for cogeneration (CHPC) or to operate while allowing the grid to act as a UPS System (uninterruptable power supply) if he chooses. Each PDI Power Solution will be customized to meet our individual client’s unique power requirements. This is accomplished by using a modular design approach for the integration of all the components which make up each system. A typical PDI Power Solution is made up of a generator (gaseous), system controller (which allows for remote diagnostics, monitoring and control of a parallel generator system), a modified cooling system, an optional heat exchanger or chiller all packaged in a weatherproof/sound attenuated enclosure. Cogeneration capability CHPC (combination heat/power/cooling) is achieved by adding a closed loop cooling system to the generators with the addition of a heat exchanger and/or chiller. The heat exchanger produces hot water which can be used for heating and/or for preheating water. The chillers provide cooling to support air conditioning or refrigeration needs. PDI Power Solutions are intended to be either stationary or portable power systems ready for rapid global deployment taking only a few hours for installation. These systems can be packaged into modules which will provide as much as 100 megawatts of power.
 
We intend to acquire all the components needed to make a PDI Power Solution and either have them installed at the generator manufacturer’s facility to our specifications or integrated at the client’s site.
 
Our potential customers include a variety of small to medium size manufacturing companies, hotels and commercial enterprises worldwide. In addition, our power solutions are ideal for large end users such as seaports, commercial laundries, airports, and the like. However, we initially intend to focus our marketing and sales efforts in the Caribbean and California markets, where we believe there is a great need for independent cost-effective reliable power. Once established in the Caribbean and California, we intend to expand our marketing throughout North America and as we move into other regions in North America, we plan to increase the power ratings of the PDI Power Solutions to include multi-megawatt power generating systems.
 
During the quarter ended March 31, 2019, Powerdyne International, Inc. purchased several crypto currency miners and began mining certain crypto coins. This was completed to enter into the crypto markets and explore other potential revenue opportunities for Powerdyne International, Inc.
 
We have not installed and activated any of our power equipment to date. Our primary activities have been in perfecting our concept and in marketing and sales of our products. As shown in our consolidated financial statements, we have incurred an accumulated deficit of $3,651,212 from inception thru December 31, 2021.

Products
 
Our product (PDI Power Solution) is a self-contained generator powered by a gaseous fueled engine which drives an electrical generator. The unit runs on natural gas, propane, or other gaseous fuels; it is compact, lightweight, and clean burning. As a result, the units produce low emissions and are energy efficient.
 
The basis of our overall business is founded on the ability to produce electrical power using state-of-the-art technology to produce electricity at a lower cost than the existing means of producing or providing primary electric power (Spark Price: the difference between the cost of electricity provided by the utility company and the cost of electricity produced by a PDI Power Solution), in its target markets. We expect that the difference between our cost to produce electrical power and the current billing rate of existing local utility providers will present savings for our customers and a continual revenue stream for us. 
 
The basic PDI Power Solution consists of three active components; a generator, system controller, and paralleling switch gear all mounted onto a common skid. The controller, switch gear and skid are all commercially available from multiple manufacturers built to our specifications. They are custom built to meet both our specifications as well as the customer’s specific power requirements. The PDI Power Solution can also have the option of having cogeneration capabilities of producing a combined heat power and cooling by adding custom integrated chillers and heat exchangers. These components once assembled onto the skid, can be put inside a weather and sound attenuated enclosure for stationary application or slid into a container and then mounted on a set of wheels for mobile and rapid deployment. The modular design approach allows for interchangeable components which allows for any component to be switched out as newer more cost-effective technology becomes available. We believe this gives us the competitive advantage of upgrading a PDI Power Solution with new technology at the customer’s facility without replacing the entire system.
 
Business Model
 
We plan to develop our business, producing and distributing primary electrical power and cogeneration CHCP capabilities through the PDI Power Solution product offerings, under long term master lease agreements, similar to the one we signed with Farmacia Brisas del Mar, at fixed capacity charge plus a usage charge based on actual power used at a fixed dollars per kilowatt hour ($/kWh). Installation, service, and maintenance of the PDI Power Solution will initially be provided through independent contractors, at no cost to the customer.
 
We intend to provide a viable alternative for local utilities to reduce the demand on the primary grid by using our equipment and power, thereby increasing the limits and capabilities of the primary grid. By using our equipment, we expect that the customer will be able to solve several problems at once. First, expensive, and polluting diesel units are replaced with cost-efficient, greener gensets. Second, the customer’s cost to produce the electrical power is reduced. Third, savings go directly to the bottom line on a monthly basis, no need to apply for energy credit annually. Fourth, maintenance is provided exclusively by us, thereby allowing the customer to reduce its workforce. Fifth, any tank farms and all other diesel support equipment or infrastructure can be dismantled and removed from the customer’s site.
 
Some generators are readily available, and some would be made to the customer’s specific needs, using the latest technology such as remote monitoring, remote auto shut down. Typical generator manufactures such as Cummings, Caterpillar, or GE for example will package their power solutions to meet the customer’s specifications using only their own equipment in standard packages. Powerdyne will review both the customer’s power requirements in addition to their budget, schedule, and expectations. Once this has been completed Powerdyne will select the best equipment from all global equipment manufactures available and custom packaging this equipment into a power solution that offers a high efficiency green power solution that meets the customer’s budget, schedule, power specifications and expectations.

The Market
 
Our market is global, and our primary focus is on placing PDI Power Solutions in manufacturing and commercial operations, as well as any other existing independent power generation application that requires high quality, steady electrical power generation. We intend to lease our units based on usage to allow customers to generate electricity on a 24/7 basis. The PDI Power Solution is ideal for any medium to large commercial user wherein electricity can be delivered to the user’s location on a cost effective, reliable basis.
 
Entry into the Market
 
We plan to enter selected target markets (i.e., the Caribbean and California) based upon the Sparks Spread. These markets were selected because we believe they have the greatest potential for immediate acceptability of the PDI Power Solution due to cost and reliability as well as offering the greatest profit potential. Once established, we plan to expand further into the Caribbean and North American markets using the same criteria: Spark Spread and profitability.
 
Pricing
 
The Fuel cost for a natural gas generator, based on the manufacture’s speck is .03 a kilowatt hour based on Natural gas’s current pricing. The financing cost are .025 to .035 a kilowatt hour based on 10% financing costs for 5 years. .01 a kilowatt hour for routine maintenance. .05 for a maintenance reserve. The total estimated costs are about .075 a kilowatt hour. The average price for electricity on the Caribbean has a range from .30 to .40 a kilowatt hour and some areas in the United States can be up to .20 to .30 a kilowatt hour.
Competition
 
We believe we are an insignificant participant among the firms, which engage in the acquisition of business opportunities. There are many established venture capital and financial concerns that have significantly greater financial and personnel resources and technical expertise than we have. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors
Employees
 
We have one executive officer. The executive officer will not receive any compensation until, and if, we raise or procure adequate capital (through operations, financings or otherwise) to pay such compensation. We expect that we will hire additional personnel as we expand our operations.
