  ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  Overview
  
  We are a security technology company focused on delivering innovative solutions to customers, primarily law enforcement and security personnel. We began demonstrations of our first product, the BolaWrap 100, in November 2017. In early 2018 we are focusing on continued product testing and evaluations by prospective customers and implementing product changes resulting from early feedback. We expect to commence product sales in mid 2018.
  
  Our BolaWrap 100 product is a hand-held remote restraint device that discharges an eight-foot bola style Kevlar tether to entangle an individual at a range of 10-25 feet. Inspired by law enforcement professionals, the small but powerful BolaWrap 100 assists law enforcement to safely and effectively control encounters. Currently, law enforcement agencies authorize a continuum of force options:
  
   ●
    verbal commands;

  

   ●
    physical control – soft techniques of grabs and holds progressing to hard techniques such as punches and kicks;

  

   ●
   less-lethal weapons - batons, pepper spray, impact munitions and conducted electrical weapons (“ CEWs”); and

  
   ●
    lethal force – deadly weapons such as firearms.

 
  BolaWrap 100 offers law enforcement a new tool to remotely and temporarily control an individual or impede flight by targeting and wrapping an individual’s legs.
  
  The small, light but rugged BolaWrap 100 is designed for weak hand operation to provide remote restraint while other use of force continuum options remain open. The design offers wide latitude of accuracy to engage and restrain targeted legs of a subject. Quick eject and rapid reload of bola cartridges allows one device to be reused in a single encounter or in multiple encounters.

  There are limited effective options for remote engagement, so when verbal commands go unheeded law enforcement is faced with either hands on engagement or other potentially injurious less lethal or lethal force. We believe our new tool is essential to meet modern policing requirements with individuals frequently not responding to verbal commands and to assuage public demands for less lethal policing. We believe our device minimizes the need to employ other uses of force including combat and less-lethal weapons. Many less-lethal weapons rely on “pain compliance” often escalating encounters with potential for injury.
  
  Primary use cases fall into the two broad categories routinely encountered by law enforcement and security personnel:
  
   ●
    remotely retain and limit the mobility of an individual attempting to evade arrest or questioning, individuals increasingly ignore law enforcement verbal commands; and

  

   ●
    assist in subduing individuals actively resisting arrest by limiting mobility, possibly making other engagement options less risky to officers and less injurious to individuals.

 
  Our commercialization efforts for the BolaWrap 100 is targeting the approximately 18,000 United States law enforcement agencies with approximately 765,000 full time officers, as well as the United States Border Patrol with 21,000 border patrol agents. We also intend to target law enforcement agencies and security personnel worldwide. We have not generated any revenues to date, have no customers and only recently commenced demonstrating product to prospective customers. We may be required to make new modifications or improvements to the product as a result of demonstrations and ongoing product testing. See “Risk Factors” included in this annual report for additional information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with our business.
  
  History
  
  We were organized as Wrap Technologies, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company on March 2, 2016 by our founders Elwood G. Norris, Scot Cohen and James A. Barnes. We are headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. Our formation followed several months of research into ensnarement techniques by our Chief Technology Officer and primary inventor, Mr. Norris. Mr. Norris has been granted over 80 U.S. patents, and with Mr. Barnes, founded LRAD Corporation (Nasdaq:LRAD), a company engaged in directed sound technologies including non-lethal acoustic hailing and warning devices sold worldwide for law enforcement, military, government and security markets.
  
  On March 31, 2017 Wrap Technologies, LLC (“Wrap LLC”) merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary MegaWest Energy Montana Corp. (“MegaWest”). Wrap LLC ceased separate existence with MegaWest continuing as the surviving entity after changing its name to Wrap Technologies, Inc. On March 22, 2017 Wrap LLC acquired privately held MegaWest from Petro River Oil Corp. (“Petro River”) a related party by virtue of Scot Cohen, an owner/manager also being an owner and the Executive Chairman of Petro River. MegaWest had no assets or liabilities at the date of acquisition and was not an operating business.
  
  In December 2017, we completed a self-underwritten public offering raising gross proceeds of approximately $3.49 million from the sale of 2,328,533 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), at a public offering price of $1.50 per share. Three officers of the Company purchased 40,000 shares of Common Stock during the offering for $60,000.
  
  Plan of Operation
  
  Our plan of operation for 2018 includes growing research, production, marketing, sales, distribution and service functions. We expect to focus significant efforts on product demonstrations and coordinating product testing by various agencies.
  
  Our research and development activities in 2018 will focus on responding and adapting to requirements identified through product demonstrations and testing by agencies and on cost reduction activities. Our research plans also include focusing on developing accessories and creating new models of our restraining device and developing other security related products.
  
  We have no plans for material acquisition of plant or equipment.
  
  Industry Background
  
  The market for use of force related products and devices includes law enforcement agencies, correctional facilities, military agencies, private security guard companies and retail consumers. We believe law enforcement officials are the opinion leaders regarding market acceptance of new security products. We therefore intend to focus on the law enforcement agency segment of the market for the BolaWrap 100.

  According to the Department of Justice (“Police Use of Nonfatal Force, 2002-2011”, Special Report NCJ 249216, Published November 2015 by the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statistics), from 2002 to 2011 an annual average of 44 million U.S. residents age 16 or older - about 19% of all persons of this age - had at least one face-to-face contact with a police officer. About 1.6% or 715,500 involved threats of or use of force. And about 1.3 million were handcuffed during their encounter with police. Nearly all local police departments and all federal law enforcement agencies have a use-of-force policy that dictates the level of force its officers can use to respond to various situations. In January 2017, a collaborative effort among 11 significant law enforcement leadership and labor organizations in the United States resulted in the publication of a National Consensus Policy on Use of Force (collaborative publication of 11 contributing law enforcement agencies organized by the International Association of Chiefs of Police and published in January 2017). This policy states, among other information:
  
   ●
    officers shall use only the force that is objectively reasonable to effectively bring an incident under control, while protecting the safety of the officer and others;

  

   ●
    officers shall use force only when no reasonably effective alternative appears to exist and shall use only the level of force which a reasonably prudent officer would use under the same or similar circumstances;

  

   ●
    an officer shall use de-escalation techniques and other alternatives to higher levels of force consistent with his or her training whenever possible and appropriate before resorting to force and to reduce the need for force; and

  

   ●
    when de-escalation techniques are not effective or appropriate, an officer may consider the use of less lethal force to control a non-compliant or actively resistant individual. An officer is authorized to use agency-approved, less lethal force techniques and issued equipment:

 
   o
    to protect the officer or others from immediate physical harm;

  

   o
    to restrain or subdue an individual who is actively resisting or evading arrest; or

  

   o
    to bring an unlawful situation safely and effectively under control.

 
  A police officer is trained to use only the minimum force necessary to overcome the threat of injury or violence posed by a suspect. For example, under most policies, an officer may not use lethal force unless a subject poses a threat of significant bodily injury or fatality to the officer or other persons.
  
  Studies have concluded that most police officers never deploy lethal force in the course of their careers. While the vast majority of law enforcement officers around the world are armed with firearms, only a small percentage will actually ever use them. Officers, however, use less lethal force on a regular basis. Traditional tactics such as using a control hold, baton, club, or combat to control a suspect may result not only in a risk of injury to the suspect, but also a risk that the officer will be injured. Other force options including chemical spray, impact munitions and CEWs not only risk injury but are often controversial. Each weapon available to law enforcement has distinct advantages and disadvantages, and we believe law enforcement agencies require different tools for different situations.
  
  We believe a new remote restraining device is necessary to meet modern policing requirements with individuals frequently not responding to verbal commands and public demands for less lethal policing. A tool to restrain at a distance may offer reduced frequency of deployment of other control techniques including CEWs. We believe that the following characteristics for our new restraining product are the most important to law enforcement and security agencies:
  
   ●
    effectiveness: remote restraint of individuals while keeping all other use of force options available;

  

   ●
    range: variable distance over which the device is effective;

  

   ●
    safety: minimal risk of injury or death;

  

   ●
    ease of use: simple operation and low maintenance;

  

   ●
    dependability: reliability in many environments, product durability;

  

   ●
    accountability: tracking to reduce misuse of the weapon; and

  

   ●
    cost: low cost per use and possible reduction of insurance and litigation expense.

 
  The BolaWrap 100 Solution
  
  The BolaWrap 100 is designed to perform well in terms of all of the above characteristics. We believe the BolaWrap 100 is a unique new device to restrain subjects safely and without eliminating any other use of force options necessary for the protection of law enforcement and the public. While no use of force technique or device is 100% effective, in our opinion, unique performance could make the BolaWrap 100 a tool of choice in a range of encounters for law enforcement agencies and other security services.

  Effectiveness
  
  Without an effective remote restraint device to assist controlling an encounter, law enforcement often defaults to less-lethal weapons that rely upon a pain response or electrical induced incapacitation for effect. These methods along with lethal force may be necessary for the most dangerous and aggressive suspects. However, there are many encounters where remote restraint may be an option in lieu of or before physical contact with an individual to reduce possibility for flight or the possibility for injury to the individual and the officer. In volunteer testing, the BolaWrap 100 has shown to be effective in restraining individuals hindering the flight ability and crippling the ability to fight allowing effective further officer action.
 Range
  
  Batons and chemical sprays can only be used from close distances, usually less than five feet. Rubber bullets, beanbag rounds, and similar less-lethal impact weapons must be used at distances greater than 30 feet to minimize suspects’ injuries. Combat, come along and wrist locks require intimate contact with suspects. The BolaWrap 100 is designed to engage a suspect at 10 to 25 feet operable by the weak hand allowing other force options to remain available. The design of the device makes it ineffective and it is not recommended for use at close distances, less than ten feet.
 Safety
  
  The BolaWrap 100 is not intended as a weapon. It does not rely on pain or electrical induced incapacitation for effectiveness. The wrapping effect is intended to impede flight while not inducing uncontrolled falls or injury. There is no issue of recovery time as the case with CEW, impact munitions or chemical devices.
 Ease of Use
  
  The BolaWrap 100 is small, light and rugged. It is designed to be operated as a weak hand device. It is simple to use, activate and deploy. It can be reloaded and deployed again as quickly as a spent cartridge can be removed and a replacement cartridge inserted, typically in less than five seconds. Further, the weapon requires no maintenance, there are no electronic components. The BolaWrap 100 also does not leave contaminating residues, unlike chemical sprays that may contaminate buildings, vehicles or other closed facilities or officer uniforms.
 Dependability
  
  The BolaWrap 100 as a mechanical device operates effectively under a variety of unfavorable conditions, such as wind and rain, and is rugged and durable.
  
  Accountability
  
  The BolaWrap 100 is designed for professional use and not consumer use. Each device and each cartridge is identified with a serial number for recordkeeping purposes.
  
  Cost
  
  The single use, but recyclable, bola cartridge is priced at a per cartridge price to allow use in both training and active deployment. While we do not believe there is a directly competitive remote restraint device, our cartridge prices are competitive with CEWs, impact munitions and most other specialized less-lethal weapons, with the exception of the least expensive chemical sprays. However, the indirect costs of decontaminating buildings, vehicles, and uniforms resulting from the use of chemical sprays can place these sprays at an overall cost disadvantage per use.
  
  In addition, litigation and insurance costs for law enforcement agencies can be significant. Reducing the frequency of need for other use of force tools and the number of injuries and fatalities caused by law enforcement officers may reduce the number of suits filed against agencies for excessive use of force, wrongful death and injury.
  
  We believe the addition of a new remote restraint device may have the benefit of increasing goodwill between law enforcement agencies and their communities. Community relations considerations can be particularly important at a time when almost any interaction with police can be recorded and scrutinized by the media and the public.

  Product
  
  Our BolaWrap 100 product is a hand-held remote restraint device that discharges an eight-foot bola style Kevlar® tether to entangle an individual at a range of 10-25 feet. BolaWrap 100 offers law enforcement a new tool to remotely engage and temporarily control individuals.
  
  The small, light but rugged BolaWrap 100 is designed to provide remote restraint while other use of force continuum options remain open. The design offers wide latitude of accuracy to engage and restrain targeted legs of a subject. Quick eject and rapid reload of bola cartridges allows one device to be reused in a single encounter or in multiple encounters.
  
  The bola cartridge contains two sockets that discharge two small pellets at a thirty to forty degree angle. The pellets are linked by the eight-foot Kevlar tether such that the tether first engages an individual’s legs then the force of the pellets causes the tether to wrap. Small barbs on each pellet engage clothing to retard the unwinding of the bola tether wrap. The bola cartridge contains a 9 mm fractional charge blank cartridge (as used in prop guns) to discharge the tether.
  
  The durable body of the BolaWrap 100 contains a receptacle for the bola cartridge along with the activation, deployment and safety mechanisms. Bola cartridges are quickly ejected allowing rapid reloading, activation and deployment.
  
  We demonstrated our first prototype device in December 2016 and developed pre-manufacturing demonstration prototypes in April 2017. We assembled first production units in November 2017 and commenced demonstrations and trial deployments with a small number of law enforcement agencies. We do not expect law enforcement field deployments and associated revenues until prospective customers test and evaluate our product and until any required modifications or improvements are incorporated into the product. See “Risk Factors” included in this annual report for additional information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with our business.
  
  Markets
  
  Law Enforcement and Corrections
  
  Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies in the United States currently represent the primary target market for the BolaWrap 100. According to United States Bureau of Justice statistics (“Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies, 2008”, U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, published July 2011), there were nearly 18,000 of these agencies in the United States in 2008 that employed about 765,000 full-time, sworn law enforcement officers. In 2005, the United States Bureau of Justice statistics (“Census of State and Federal Correctional Facilities, 2005”, U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, published October 2008) estimated that there were 295,000 correctional officers in over 1,800 federal and state correctional facilities in the United States.
 United States Border Patrol (USBP)
  
  With over 21,000 agents (“Border Patrol Overview”, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, January 27, 2015, Web. 25, September 2017, https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/along-us-borders/overview), this is one of the largest law enforcement agencies in the United States with a large number of encounters with individuals requiring soft engagement techniques. We believe the BolaWrap 100 can be an effective tool to safely assist in detention of individuals subject to the agency’s jurisdiction. The BolaWrap 100 offers an additional tool for frontline agents to de-escalate encounters while effecting agent responsibilities.
 Private Security Firms and Guard Services
  
  According to 2016 Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates (“Occupational Employment Statistics”, United States Department of Labor, March 31, 2017, Web. 25 September 2017), there were approximately 1.1 million privately employed security guards in the United States. They represent a broad range of individuals, including investigation and security services, hospitals, schools, local government, and others. We believe that some security personnel armed with BolaWrap 100 could be effective to de-escalate some encounters without eliminating other tools available today. Providing guards with BolaWrap 100 may reduce the potential liability of private security companies and personnel in such encounters.
  
  Although there are use cases in correctional facilities and by certain military policing personnel, we are initially targeting BolaWrap 100 for law enforcement and security personnel markets. We do not currently plan a consumer version of the device.

  Selling and Marketing
  
  Law enforcement agencies represent our primary target market. In this market, we expect that the decision to purchase the BolaWrap 100 will normally be made by a group of people including the agency head, his training staff, and use of force and weapons experts. The decision sometimes involves political decision-makers such as city council members. While we expect the decision-making process for a remote restraint device will be less controversial than that for less-lethal products such as CEWs, we still expect the process to take as little as a few weeks or as long as a year or more partially due to budgeting reasons.
  
  While initial sales will be made by our executive and sales employees, we may determine to utilize existing networks of independent regional police equipment distributors compensated on a commission and incentive basis.
  
  Most law enforcement and corrections agencies will not purchase new use of force devices until a training program is in place to certify officers in their proper use. We are developing and intend to offer training and class materials that certify law enforcement trainers as instructors in the use and limitations of the BolaWrap 100.
  
  In addition to our planned training, we plan to participate in a variety of trade shows and conferences. We expect our marketing efforts will also benefit from significant free media coverage. Other marketing communications may include video e-mails, press releases, and conventional print advertising in law enforcement trade publications. We are designing a website to contain similar marketing information and are developing social media outreach and communications.
  
  Our Strategy
  
  Our goal is to realize the potential of a new remote restraint device targeting law enforcement and security personnel. We aim to produce a product line starting with the BolaWrap 100 to meet the requirements of these customers. The key elements of our strategy include:
  
   ●
    produce a product line meeting customer requirements as a new tool to aid in the retention of individuals to make encounters more effective and less dangerous to law enforcement and the public;

  


   ●
    develop a robust production and supply system to support our customers; and

  


   ●
    develop relationships with customers requiring large numbers of products mainly larger city police departments and larger agencies.

 
  We also plan to explore international markets and developing products for use by security and related personnel.
  
  Related Party License and Royalties
  
  We are obligated to pay royalties pursuant to an exclusive Amended and Restated Intellectual Property License Agreement, dated as of September 30, 2016, with Syzygy Licensing, LLC (“Syzygy”), a private technology invention, consulting and licensing company owned and controlled by Elwood G. Norris and James A. Barnes, both officers and shareholders of the Company. Syzygy has no ongoing operations, and does not engage in any manufacturing, production or other related activities.
  
  The agreement provides for the payment of royalties of 4% of revenues from products employing the licensed device technology up to the earlier to occur of (i) the payment by the Company of an aggregate of $1.0 million in royalties, or (ii) September 30, 2026. All development and patent costs have been paid by us and patent applications and the technology related to the BolaWrap 100 have been assigned to the Company, subject to the royalty obligation.
  
  Manufacturing and Suppliers
  
  We completed the design and have commenced initial small volume production of the BolaWrap 100 and related cartridges. We source components from a variety of suppliers with final assembly, testing and shipping occurring in our facility in Las Vegas, Nevada. We believe arranging and maintaining quality manufacturing capacity will be essential to the performance of our products and the growth of our business.
 Warranties
  
  We expect to warranty our products to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for a period up to one year from the date of purchase. The warranty will be generally a limited warranty, and in some instances impose certain shipping costs on the customer. We expect in most cases it will be more economical and effective to replace the defective device rather than repair.

  Competition
  
  While we are targeting the BolaWrap 100 as a new solution for law enforcement and not as a replacement for other tools currently in use, we will still compete with other use of force products for budgets. Law enforcement agencies may also determine that we are an alternative to other solutions in spite of such positioning.
  
  Other use of force devices including CEWs sold by Axon Enterprises, Inc. (formerly Taser International, Inc.), and pepper spray, batons, impact weapons sold by companies such as Defense Technology will compete with the BolaWrap 100 indirectly. Many law enforcement and corrections personnel consider such less-lethal weapons to be distinct tools, each best-suited to a particular set of circumstances. Consistent with this tool kit approach, purchasing any given tool does not preclude the purchase of one or several more. In other cases, budgetary considerations and limited space on officers’ belts dictate that only a limited number of devices will be purchased and carried. We believe the BolaWrap 100’s unique remote restraint use, effectiveness, and low possibility of injury will enable it to compete effectively against other alternatives.
  
  Many of our present and potential future competitors have, or may have, substantially greater resources to devote to compete in the law enforcement market and to further technological and new product developments. Also, these competitors or others may introduce products with features and performance competitive to our product.
  
  Seasonality
  
  We do not expect to experience any significant seasonality trends. However, seasonality trends may occur in the future.
  
  Government Regulation
  
  The BolaWrap 100 is classified as a “firearm” by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“ATF”), and is subject to federal firearms-related regulations. We hold a Federal Firearms Manufacturing License that expires in 2020. Many states also have regulations restricting the sale and use of certain firearms and may determine their own classification and restrictions irrespective of ATF regulation. In most cases, the law enforcement and corrections market is subject to different ATF and state regulations or exemptions than the private citizen market, and we do not expect additional state restrictions or approvals for sales to law enforcement. Where different regulations exist, we expect that the regulations affecting the private citizen market may also apply to the private security markets, except as the applicable regulations otherwise specifically provide.
  
  BolaWrap 100 may also be considered a firearm or a crime control product by the U.S. government. Accordingly, the export of our devices will be regulated under export administration regulations. As a result, we must obtain export licenses from the Department of Commerce for all shipments to foreign countries other than Canada. We do not expect the need to obtain these licenses will cause a material delay in any future foreign shipments. Export regulations also prohibit the further shipment of our products from foreign markets in which we hold a valid export license to foreign markets in which we do not hold an export license for our products.
  
  Foreign regulations, which may affect our device, and sale thereof, are numerous and often unclear. We expect to work with a distributor or advisor who is familiar with the applicable import regulations in each of any future foreign markets.
  
  Intellectual Property
  
  We intend to protect our intellectual property assets including pending patents, trademarks and trade craft and trade secrets such as know-how. In addition, we use confidentiality agreements with employees and some suppliers to ensure the safety of our trade secrets. We have five U.S. patents pending and have filed one application to extend protection in certain other foreign jurisdictions. We have filed for trade name protection for “BolaWrap” and expect to employ a combination of registered and common law trade names, trademarks and service marks in our business. We expect to rely on a variety of intellectual property protections for our products and technologies, including contractual obligations, and we intend to pursue a policy of vigorously enforcing such rights.
  
  We have an ongoing policy of filing patent applications to seek protection for novel features of our products and technologies. Prior to the filing and granting of patents, our policy is to disclose key features to patent counsel and maintain these features as trade secrets prior to product introduction. Patent applications may not result in issued patents covering all important claims and could be denied in their entirety.
  
  The use of force product industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Others, including academic institutions and competitors, hold numerous patents in less-lethal and related technologies. Although we are not aware of any existing patents that would materially inhibit our ability to commercialize our technology, others may assert claims in the future. Such claims, with or without merit, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
  
 
   
-7-



 
 
  The failure to obtain patent protection or the loss of patent protection on our existing and future technologies or the circumvention of our patents by competitors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete successfully.
  
  Our policy is to enter into nondisclosure agreements with each employee and consultant or third party to whom any of our proprietary information is disclosed. These agreements prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to others, both during and subsequent to employment or the duration of the working relationship. These agreements may not prevent disclosure of confidential information or provide adequate remedies for any breach.
  
  Research and Development
  
  Our research and development initiatives are led by our internal personnel and make use of specialized consultants when necessary. These initiatives include basic research, mechanical engineering design and testing. Future development projects will focus on new versions of the BolaWrap technology and new security technologies. Total research and development expenditures were $311,335 and $217,244 in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 Employees and Executive Officers
  
  We have four executive officers. We have five other employees with three engaged in sales and marketing, one in production and one in research and development. We employ consultants from time to time to provide additional sales and marketing services.
  
  We believe we offer competitive compensation and other benefits and that our employee relations are good.
