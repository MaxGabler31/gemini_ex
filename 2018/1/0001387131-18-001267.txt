Natural Rubber Latex
 
Vystar Corporation (“Vystar”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is the creator and exclusive owner of the innovative technology to produce Vytex® Natural Rubber Latex (“NRL”). The Vytex Division contains our global multi-patented technology that reduces antigenic and total protein in natural rubber latex products to virtually undetectable levels. Vytex NRL, our “ultra-low protein” natural rubber latex has been introduced throughout the worldwide marketplace that uses NRL or latex substitutes as a raw material for end products. Natural rubber latex or latex substitutes are used in an extensive range of products including balloons, textiles, footwear and clothing (threads), adhesives, foams (mattresses, pillows, mattress toppers, etc.), furniture (foam and adhesives), carpet, paints, coatings, protective equipment, sporting equipment, and, especially health care products such as condoms, surgical and exam gloves, among others. Our challenge has been that a manufacturer’s conversion from the use of standard latex or synthetic raw material to Vytex NRL involves a protracted sales cycle ranging from eighteen to thirty-six months. We have seen that same cycle apply to the newest version of Vytex NRL, a dry rubber sampling targeted for the tire and tubing industries. Additionally, in the past, our primary method of distribution was via toll manufacturing. We now have several licensing agreements in place for global distribution that have allowed us to focus on and transition to sales and marketing with a technical oversight.
 
Natural rubber latex is an agricultural product produced from the sap of the rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis. In presentations at the 5th World Elastomer Conference held in Dusseldorf, Germany during early March 2018 it was noted that there was a slowing growth rate in global NR consumption and it was predicted demand would fall over the next two years. The numbers 1 and 2 producers (Thailand and Indonesia) had a modest fall in production while Malaysia, China and India showed a large negative gap between output and capacity mainly based on current low prices. Vietnam continues at 85 to 95% capacity. There is a huge natural rubber capacity surplus until the early 2030s and prices will remain flat through 2025. With growing substitution of synthetics, that an uptick in prices may not occur and based on the pricing of synthetics the market share competition may weigh more to synthetics.
 
Substantially all the latex processors are in Southeast Asia, India, Africa and Latin America and are owned by local groups or large multinational corporations. This future demand is awakening interest in other areas of the world where the climate is suitable, particularly in Guatemala, where focus now shifts to certifications from the Forestry Stewardship Council and Rainforest Alliance, as a specialty latex. In addition to the resurgence of Central and South America in natural rubber latex production, countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Cameroon have launched major efforts to meet the needs of the global liquid natural rubber latex market. Vietnam is now a major processor of our Vytex NRL and several trial runs of the specialty offerings discussed below that are in place for manufacturer trials and we now have two producers in Guatemala, one in the trial phase.
 
Our initial product portfolio included Vytex NRL in high ammonia (HA) and low ammonia (LA) formulations. New specialized formulations are projected to come to market over the next year with trials in ultra-low ammonia, pre-vulcanized and low nitrosamine versions currently taking place. Vystar has used its technology to work with customers to solve production issues and provide them with a point of difference and guidance as research using Vytex has headed into directions previously thought to be off-limits to natural rubber latex. It appears to be the removal of the vast majority of the proteins, the carotenoids and the non-rubbers that affords Vytex NRL this opportunity.
 
Board of Directors Member and Research & Development Director Ranjit K. Matthan, Ph.D., revealed ongoing developments in the formulation of Vytex NRL with reduced or no ammonia and nitrosamines at the International Latex Conference (ILC) session titled “Advances in Environmentally Friendly Ultra Low Protein Natural Rubber Specialty Latices” on August 12, 2015. The significant advances in aluminum hydroxide-treated Vytex NRL properties and applications are potential game-changers for the issues of volatile organic content and nitrosamines for some critical latex products, such as balloons, catheters, condoms, and other medical devices, as well as enabling cleaner and more sustainable work environments. The expanded Vystar product grades make it applicable in a wider range of latex products with the advantage of improved environmental impact through reduced leachables/extractables. The advances deliver a simplified, sustainable, totally safe raw material that Vystar can offer for several applications without reservations about nitrosamines. Vystar has initiated a scale up to lab production of all three newer versions of Vytex NRL and has commenced a sample fulfillment mode with a significant manufacturer of women’s intimate apparel who is in the final testing stages of two of the grades (no ammonia and ultra-low ammonia) as possible replacements of their current raw materials.
 
 Recently at the Nuremberg Toy Show (Speilwarenmesse) Vytex NRL was a targeted product for manufacturers of balloons, masks, etc. On the main page of the European Balloons and Party Council web site is a Yahoo video still plus a recent press release that discusses the benefits of Vytex NRL in items such as balloons. As there is a new proposal for limits on protein content of balloons by virtue of an EN listing, Vytex has now gone in to full prevulcanized testing to start the sampling process in selected areas based on manufacturing needs.

Over the course of several years, our technical groups have presented technical papers of varying topics that still hold relevance. Vytex NRL is produced at the latex processor level and can be integrated into the current processing environments without additional capital equipment investment. The protein removal and modification process that leads to Vytex NRL allows manufacturers to lower manufacturing costs with the benefit of reduced protein levels. Reduced leaching times and resulting reductions in energy, water and material handling consumption can lead to realized cost savings.
 
Also, “Eco-Friendly Manufacturing of High Performance Latex using Ultra Low Antigenic Protein Latex” reviewed some of the learnings Vystar had made since commercializing Vytex NRL. Among these discoveries were: improved air and helium retention in balloons; reduced leaching needs for some dipped products; truer colors for dyed dipped products (such as balloons); and low latex odor in foams, which has now led to unique research into areas previously considered off-limits to NRL. Vystar published and presented a paper, “Further Development of Vytex® Natural Rubber Latex Leads to Strong Niche Market Advances”, that added additional learnings related to slow release (memory) foam formulations and other technical improvements helping customers solve their new product development challenges.
 
Vystar has transitioned from toll manufacturing agreements to licensing agreements that eliminate the need to maintain a costly infrastructure along with the other investment and regulatory compliance costs to develop and operate a processing or manufacturing facility. All of these costs are or will be borne by our manufacturing and distribution contractors and/or customers. This means we must show the NRL producers and product manufacturers the economic value proposition of including Vytex NRL in their product lines, hence the technical paper presentations we have made and continue to make. In addition, as an all-natural raw material, Vytex NRL puts the main component in gloves and other products back in the environmentally friendly arena.
 
To implement our licensing model, in March 2010 we signed a licensing agreement with Pica de Hule Natural, a division of Grupo Agroindustrial de Occidente (“Occidente”), located in Guatemala. Occidente is the largest processor of natural rubber latex in Latin America and the largest exporter serving more than 15 countries. Under the agreement, Occidente will manufacture, sell and market Vytex NRL throughout Latin America as well as supply Vytex NRL to North America and Europe. This agreement was continued in 2017 and remains in place currently.
 
Additionally, in 2017, Vystar began trials to process various Vytex offerings, including pre-vulcanized grades, at Forteleza’s new facility in Guatemala with initial good results. This is an important strategic maneuver to handle demand in the North, Central and South American regions as well as certain areas of Southeast Asia. This will lead to a new agreement between the two companies upon successful completion of the trials.
 
In addition, in January 2009, we entered into a Distribution Agreement with Centrotrade Minerals & Metals, US and Centrotrade Deutschland, GmbH, Germany, a leading global distributor of latex raw materials, to create a worldwide distribution network that will further enhance our ability to cost effectively reach and service manufacturer customers in these key manufacturing areas. This provides an expansive distribution network that facilitates both the licensing and toll manufacturing models and can assist with various processors in taking their products to market. On December 19, 2012, we amended our agreement with Centrotrade to expand Vytex NRL distribution rights to the world’s largest NRL consuming markets in Southeast Asia, specifically Malaysia and Thailand. Under this new license agreement, Centrotrade controls production scheduling of Vytex NRL, inventory in Thailand, sales, pricing and customer financing, while Vystar will focus on marketing, customized product development, as noted above, and support activities. Vystar currently has no exclusive areas under contract as RCMA, a Dutch based distributor was added in 2016.
 
In December 2017 Halcyon Agri, the owners of Centrotrade, announced that they had acquired RCMA’s polymer group and would operate it under the Wurfbain label.
 
The paper entitled, “The Non-Enzymatic Deproteinization of Natural Rubber Latex (DPNRL) Enabling the Greater Versatility in End Product Applications” discussed improvements that extend beyond the ultra-low allergenicity of the DPNRL and include improved color, absence of rubber odor, and improved physicochemical attributes. Improved air and helium retentions results were reported. The potential to extend applications into other non-conventional areas other than latex end products was discussed and we are currently in the final retail test market stages for the United States based manufacturing of mattresses, pillows and toppers to key furniture stores and buying groups, primarily in the Northeastern United States and signed a 5 year renewable agreement in January 2015 with Nature’s Home Solutions (NHS) to exclusively distribute these products in the United States. In September 2016, the Vystar Board of Directors voted to end the January 2015 NHS agreement and replace it with a global exclusive for foam manufactured with Vytex and sold into the home furnishings industry. This change reflects the global nature of the mattress, topper and pillow businesses, the need for local warehousing, and access to container loads of foam cores and pillows for European and Asian manufacturers.
 
 Vystar has also expanded licensing arrangements into the consumer arena, with the licensing of foam products produced with and labeled as “Made with Vytex NRL”. Specifically working with partners, to introduce foam made with Vytex into the mattress, mattress topper and pillow arenas aligning with key foam manufacturers, mattress, mattress toppers and pillow producers, and furniture stores in specific areas of the Unites States. Vystar announced the signing of the aforementioned exclusive global distribution agreement with Worcester, MA based NHS who sources eco-friendly materials and technologies for use in furnishings and other markets. NHS has completed several trials with Vietnamese, European and Indian makers of foam products to use its Vytex NRL raw material in their current offerings in their own areas as well as to supply added needs for foam cores in both the mattress and topper arenas globally. The current requests from major mattress manufactures for Vytex foam trials involves different densities especially those used on the upper levels of mattresses. The samples have been presented to the manufacturers and feedback has been very positive with names such as Gold Bond, King Coil (Natura) and SpringAir (Nature’s Rest) adding Vytex to their current offerings. A similar trial occurred in October 2016 in Thailand focusing on specific densities and pillows, and a meeting with a Belgian foam maker using a unique drying concept occurred in May 2016 with discussions ongoing. In addition, working with NHS and a large Vietnamese foam manufacturer, Lien A, the group attended the International Sleep Products Association (ISPA) in Orlando in March 2016 and has followed that joint effort with ISPA 2018 in Charlotte, North Carolina. The significance of ISPA is the focus on components for use with major mattress and pillow manufacturers, which takes Vytex foam to an additional audience.

Pricing of materials in the rubber and latex industries continues to fluctuate as noted by the graph below courtesy of Centrotrade. Prices of centrifuged latex, thus Vytex, have risen throughout 2016, 2017, and into early 2018 due to various factors such as floods in southern Thailand, removal of older tress and replanting which is a seven-year process, newer plantations coming online, etc.
 


Competition
 
Natural Rubber Latex
 
Synthetic raw materials such as ethylene, propylene, styrene and butadiene compete with NRL. Currently, it is estimated that NRL processors have lost one-half of the overall latex market to synthetic latex. Despite the switch to non-latex alternatives, it is estimated that almost 70% of exam gloves and nearly 80% of surgical gloves used in U.S. hospitals are still made with NRL.
 
During 2017 Vystar contracted with various consultants and manufacturers to make exam and surgical gloves on an OEM basis. The testing and results were encouraging and led to further efforts prepare for a potential launch of these lines in 2018. The company is going to proceed with testing and subsequent filing with the USFDA to obtain 510(k) allowances. With this new OEM structure, the Company will bring several versions (surgical, exam, household, etc) of the gloves to market under its own OEM brand label.
 
Several attempts, including new source crops, synthetic lattices and various treatment methods, have been made to eliminate problem proteins from Hevea NRL by biological, physical and/or chemical methods that act on proteins. One approach has been to introduce the latex articles to multiple leaching steps and chlorination. While it does reduce the protein levels in the finished product, it weakens the latex film thus compromising the desirable physical properties of the product. Another attempt to reduce proteins in NRL is the use of proteolytic enzymes to degrade the proteins in the latex solution but this approach introduces another protein (the enzyme) to the latex, which may itself be allergenic. Attempts to commercialize two other non-Hevea NRL materials have been made in the United States: guayule rubber latex and Taraxacum kok-saghyz, also known as the Russian dandelion. These materials are reported to be higher in cost compared to natural rubber latex and presently are available only in limited quantities.

These facts, coupled with the uncomplicated transition to the utilization of Vytex NRL, make it very attractive for processors to regain lost business by switching to Vytex NRL. We believe our unique patented technology offers a viable alternative to the marketplace. The licensing model will allow the message to spread through more sales channels than we could reach in the past.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Vystar has four issued patents by the United States Patent Trademark Office (“USPTO”) that were issued in 2005 (Patent No. 6,906,126), 2006 (Patent No. 7,056,970), 2011 (Patent No. 8,048,951) and 2012 (Patent No. 8,324,312). International patents include one issued patent from the Republic of South Africa in 2009 (2008/00886), a second foreign patent issued by China in 2011 (No. 200580051526.1), a third foreign patent issued by Japan in 2012 (No. 4944885) and a fourth foreign patent issued by Hong Kong in 2013 (HK1125959). In 2005, we sought international patent protection of our application that would become our U.S. Patent No. 6,906,126 pursuant to the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) (No. PCT/US2005/025018), and this application has been nationalized in the following countries and regions: The European Union (No.05775523.3), Canada (No. 2,614,945), India (No.295/DELNP/2008), and Sri Lanka (No.14827). Additionally, this PCT was nationalized back into the United States to expand our protection to both method and composition claims (No.11/988,498). We expect patents to be issued in these countries without objection.
 
 On January 18, 2012, we converted the provisional patent filed January 18, 2011 (No. 61/433,853) to full utility applications based on new discoveries and unexpected results (No. 13/374,851). We also sought international protection for the new developments and unexpected results reflected in this 2009 USPTO patent application through another PCT application (No. PCT/US2009/031445). This PCT application was nationalized in the following countries in 2010: the European Union (No. 09702339.4), Brazil (No. PI0906513-0), Guatemala (No. 2010-000208), India (No.2487/KOLNP/2010), Indonesia (No. W-00201002436), and Malaysia (No. PI2010003317). In addition, we filed the same patent application that was the subject of our USPTO patent application No. 12/356,355 and PCT/US2009/031445 directly into Thailand (No. 0901000201). Thailand has informed us our patent application is now published for open comments and Vystar has responded to various questions by Thailand’s patent office and is awaiting their response.
 
On January 18, 2017 Vystar was informed that the Indian Patent Office approved our application (2487/KOLNP/2010) entitled, “Natural Rubber Latex Having Reduced Allergenicity and Method of Making” under Patent Number 279323.
 
On February 8, 2017 Vystar received notice of grant from the Guatemalan Patent Office for application number 2010-000208 entitled, “Natural Rubber Latex Having Reduced Allergenicity and Method of Making” and is awaiting a grant number.
 
On October 27, 2017 Vystar was granted its second Indian patent (288824) from Application No.: 295/DELNP/2008 entitled: “Decreasing Allergenicity of Natural Latex Rubber Prior to Vulcanization.” The European Patent Office issued a Decision to Grant Vystar’s patent application under European Patent Number 1 902 089 titled “Decreasing Allergenicity of Natural Latex Rubber Prior to Vulcanization” greatly expanding the territory covered by the Company’s intellectual property portfolio. The mention of the grant was published in the European Patent Bulletin 13/35 dated 28 August 2013. Vystar selected the United Kingdom (065143-011612/UK), Germany (065143-011611/DE), and Austria (065143-001610/AT) as validation points for this specific patent. There is a second patent application still in process for Europe that can expand the countries that are validated.
 
On December 9, 2016 Vystar was notified by our Singaporean IP Counsel that Malaysia Application No PI 2010003317 entitled “Natural Rubber Latex Having Reduced Allergenicity and Method of Making” was cleared for issuance and that a Notice of Grant will be issued.
 
Vystar filed and has received registered trademark protected status in the United States for the marks “Vystar”, “Vytex” and “Created by Nature. Recreated by Science.” In 2010 Vystar filed for international trademark protection of “Vytex” in Malaysia (No.2010013149) and India (No. 1992991), which was granted in India. On November 18, 2014, the Company was informed that the “VYTEX” trademark was registered in Malaysia effective May 30, 2014. The aforementioned trademarks have been renewed successfully in each period as required.
 
While we believe that the pending patent and trademark applications will be granted without objection, there are no guarantees that all such patents or trademarks will be granted by each relevant governing body. No assurance can be given that such patent and trademark protection will provide substantial protection from competition. We realize that the market for Vytex NRL is an industrialized world concern and we are committed to aggressively challenging any infringements of our patents and/or trademarks. As of December 31, 2017, Vystar has expended, since inception, approximately $290,195 on such patent and trademark costs and has budgeted approximately $25,000 more for the year ended December 31, 2018 to continue to pursue and maintain its patents and trademarks around the world.

Research and Development
 
Vytex NRL has produced protein test results on finished products that are both “below detection” and “not detectable” in terms of the amount of proteins remaining in these finished goods made with Vytex NRL. These results have been reproduced in many subsequent tests. From inception through December 31, 2017, Vystar’s research and development costs have been approximately $2.4 million. These efforts past and future have been and will continue to be patented and/or trademarked.
Government Regulation
 
In the United States, healthcare and many food and food-based packaging products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Vystar is not directly subject to regulation by the FDA due to the fact that it does not manufacture a finished medical device or other product, but only provides Vytex NRL as a component or raw material to healthcare or other product manufacturers. However, there will be FDA regulation of the labeling of healthcare and food-based packaging products that are produced with Vytex NRL and the FDA has promulgated standards for good manufacturing practices for manufacturing the end products, which makes the end product manufacturers responsible for seeing that all of their components and component manufacturers, including Vytex NRL, are produced using good manufacturing processes. Additionally, the FDA prohibits the use of the term “hypoallergenic” or “low protein” on any natural rubber latex product it regulates. In order to make any such claim, the latex product manufacturer must seek a waiver from the FDA of such regulatory prohibitions. Commentary by the FDA in its guidance documents and other rulings indicate that the prohibition on the use of the “hypoallergenic” or “low protein” label is based, at least in part, on the fact that, although the use of such terms in such labeling may be intended to indicate that the risk of allergic reaction to residual levels of processing chemicals has been reduced, consumers may interpret the labeling to mean that the risk of allergic reactions to any component in the device would be minimal. Thus the hypoallergenic or low protein label is deemed misleading. There can be no assurance, however, that we will succeed in securing FDA approval for any claim regarding the “hypoallergenic” “low protein” or reduced allergy potential of latex produced with the Vytex NRL process. Failure to secure, if required, such FDA approval, could delay or otherwise detrimentally affect our introduction to natural rubber latex healthcare and/or food packaging products regulated by the FDA. Notwithstanding, the medical or food packaging manufacturer will be able to use the Vytex NRL trademark on its label if size permits to indicate only that the Vytex NRL component was used in the production of the healthcare product, and what protein levels the end product does contain, but no further claim is asserted. We have been able to provide sufficient testing data to the FDA to support our protein level claims with respect to the natural rubber latex antigenic and total proteins present in end products made with Vytex NRL. On May 1, 2009, a condom manufactured from Vytex NRL received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This was the first medical product available in the U.S. made from Vytex NRL, which had less than 2 micrograms/dm2, virtually undetectable levels, of the antigenic proteins that cause an allergic response, while retaining and improving upon all of the desirable qualities of latex. While the product is no longer available, this condom is a predicate device for future products and the 510(k) is still in existence. Vystar continues to seek other U.S. and global manufacturers interested in pursuing similar claims for products.
 
 On July 22, 2009, a non-powdered medical exam glove manufactured with Vytex NRL received 510(k) clearance from the FDA, with an approved claim of less than 50 micrograms/gram of total proteins. As with the condom product, Vystar continues to pursue U.S. and global manufacturers using this exam glove as a predicate device and to help fill pending exam glove business. Late in 2016 the FDA banned the use of powder in medical gloves which took effect early in 2017 positioning the Vytex non-powdered exam glove in an excellent position.
 
Inflation and Seasonality
 
We do not believe that our operations are significantly impacted by inflation. Our NRL business is not seasonal in nature but is subject to commodity pricing. Our NRL product is a commodity-based raw material and prices for such material fluctuate from day-to-day, though this will have less impact as we transition to sales via licensing fees.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, Vystar had a total of one associate.
