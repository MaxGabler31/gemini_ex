Overview
 We have created a comprehensive cloud-based software platform designed to transform and modernize accounting and finance operations for organizations of all types and sizes.  Our secure, scalable platform supports critical accounting processes such as the financial close, account reconciliations, intercompany accounting, and controls assurance.  By introducing software to automate these processes and to enable them to function continuously, we empower our customers to improve the integrity of their financial reporting, increase efficiency in their accounting and finance processes and enhance real-time visibility into their results and operations.
 Critical accounting and finance processes underlie the integrity of an organization’s financial reports.  The lack of effective accounting and finance tools can result in inefficient and cumbersome processes and, in some cases, accounting errors, restatements and write-offs, as well as material weaknesses and significant deficiencies.  Traditional enterprise resource planning, or ERP, systems do not generally provide effective solutions for processes handled outside of an organization’s general ledger, such as balance sheet account reconciliation, intercompany transaction accounting and the broader financial close process.  Many organizations also use multiple ERPs and other financial systems without a platform to efficiently integrate them.  As a result, to manage these tasks, organizations rely on spreadsheets and other error-prone and labor-intensive processes that are unsuited for the increasing regulatory complexity and transaction volumes encountered by many modern businesses.  We believe that we are creating a new category of powerful cloud-based software that is capable of automating and streamlining accounting and finance operations, in a manner that complements and supports traditional ERP systems.  We believe our customers benefit from cost savings through improvements in process management and staff productivity, in addition to managing a faster financial close.

Our mission is to transform how accounting and finance departments operate.  Our approach modernizes what historically has been done through batch processing and manual controls typically applied only during the month, quarter or year-end financial close, and delivers dynamic workflows embedded within a real-time, highly automated framework, a process we refer to as “continuous accounting.”  It also enables up-to-date analytics, provides industry-benchmarked metrics and is designed to help customers run more efficiently while achieving greater accuracy, control and transparency.  We believe the need for our software has been driven by growing business and information technology complexities, transaction volumes and expanding regulatory requirements.  Our software integrates with, and obtains data from, more than 30 different ERP systems, including NetSuite, Oracle, SAP, and Workday, as well as many other financial systems and applications such as bank accounts, sub-ledgers and in-house databases.
 We believe that we have a leading position in the enhanced financial controls and automation market because we were one of the first companies to bring software with this functionality to market and we have a limited number of competitors.  The 2017 Gartner Report, “Magic Quadrant for Cloud Financial Corporate Performance Management Solutions,” or the “Gartner Report,” identified us as a Leader in the Magic Quadrant for Cloud Financial Corporate Performance Management Solutions for our completeness of vision and ability to execute. 
 At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 2,200 customers with approximately 196,000 users in over 150 countries exclusive of our acquisition of Runbook Company B.V., a Netherlands-based provider of financial close automation software and integration solutions for SAP customers, (“Runbook”) on August 31, 2016 (the “Runbook Acquisition”). We continue to build strategic relationships with technology vendors, professional services firms, business process outsourcers and resellers.
 We are a holding company and conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, BlackLine Systems, Inc. (“BlackLine Systems”). BlackLine Systems funded its business with investments from our founder and cash flows from operations until September 3, 2013, we acquired BlackLine Systems, and Silver Lake Sumeru and Iconiq acquired a controlling interest in us, which we refer to as the “2013 Acquisition” The 2013 Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under GAAP, and resulted in a change in accounting basis as of the date of the 2013 Acquisition.
 Our platform consists of eight core cloud-based products, including Transaction Matching, Account Reconciliations, Consolidation Integrity Manager, Daily Reconciliations, Journal Entry, Variance Analysis, Task Management, and Insights. Customers typically purchase these products in packages that we refer to as solutions, but they have the option to purchase these products individually. Current solutions include Balance Sheet Integrity, Close Process Management, Accounting Process Automation, Finance Transformation, Intercompany Hub, and Smart Close.
 We sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales force, which leverages our relationships with technology vendors, professional services firms and business process outsourcers. In particular, we have a strategic relationship with SAP.  Our solutions are SAP endorsed business solutions that integrate with SAP’s ERP solutions.
 We target our sales and marketing efforts at both enterprise and mid-market businesses. We define the enterprise market as companies with greater than $500 million in annual revenue, and we define mid-market as companies with between $50 and $500 million in annual revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales to enterprise and mid-market customers represented 84% and 16% of our revenues, respectively. Additionally, we target our efforts at both new customers and existing customers. Existing customers may renew their subscriptions and broaden the deployment of our platform across their organizations by increasing the number of users accessing our platform or by adding additional products.
 We will adopt the Accounting Standards Codification No. 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), in the first quarter of 2018 using the retrospective method, which will result in the retrospective adjustment of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The adoption of this new standard will impact how we account for certain of our revenue arrangements and for sales commissions. See “Significant Accounting Policies - Recent accounting pronouncements” in Note 2 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Industry Background
 Accounting is a Universal Mission-Critical Function
 Organizations need reliable financial information to plan and execute business initiatives, measure operational progress and satisfy regulatory and financial obligations.  For each period-end, enterprise accounting functions typically record, process, reconcile, consolidate, and report financial transactions that are consolidated into useable financial information.  These activities typically support other core business functions such as payroll, treasury, procure-to-pay, and order-to-cash processes.  Traditionally, many accounting processes, such as balance sheet account reconciliation, intercompany transaction accounting and the broader financial close calendar, are managed and tracked with spreadsheets that are manually reconciled on a periodic basis, and which are often labor-intensive, inefficient and error-prone.  The risks of employing traditional methods include lapses in regulatory compliance, damage to brand and public image, and negative impacts on financial health and transparency.
Modern Business is Increasingly Complex
 Organizations of all sizes are operating in an increasingly global, complex and fast-moving business environment that presents significant challenges to the performance of the accounting and finance functions.  Accountants must process and verify transactions that occur both within and across international borders, involve multiple currencies and require compliance with varying legal, regulatory and tax frameworks.  This transactional complexity is exacerbated by other factors typical of global business, such as distance, language barriers and differing time zones.  In addition, modern enterprises generate massive amounts of transaction data.  It is common for organizations to have thousands of different accounts—potentially comprising billions of records—and to use numerous different financial and operational systems to store that data.  Furthermore, companies employ increasingly sophisticated corporate structures that often require accountants to reconcile accounts across various business units and geographies.  We believe that the complexity of modern corporate structures and transactions, combined with mounting transaction volumes and a fragmented information technology landscape, creates a significant need for increased automation, efficiency and visibility in accounting and finance.
 The Risk of Regulatory Non-Compliance is Significant
 Public accounting follows a variety of rules and standards for the processing, recognition and reporting of transactions. These standards, such as generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, are highly specific, apply differently across industries and geographies and, in some cases, provide conflicting guidance. More specific frameworks such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 govern internal controls, disclosure management and audit conduct. Some highly-regulated industries, including financial services, gaming and insurance, have additional specific regulatory requirements. In addition, accounting standards periodically change, such as the revenue recognition accounting standard issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB in 2014, which must be adopted by public companies in the first quarter of 2018 and has required an overhaul of many public accounting systems and practices. The resulting tangle of stringent, changing and sometimes conflicting regulations typically requires that organizations maintain more than one set of records, invest heavily in implementing and monitoring internal controls, and undergo expensive and time-consuming audits.
 Incorrect financial information can have severe repercussions. A single restatement can cost millions of dollars in forensic accounting and audit fees, lead to significant remediation expenses, generate investor lawsuits, and seriously damage an enterprise’s reputation. A material weakness can also trigger noncompliance with debt covenants and damage an organization’s credit-worthiness. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, has also proposed new rules that will require companies to “claw back” incentive-based executive compensation as a result of an accounting restatement. According to the Center for Audit Quality, from 2003 to 2012, 10,479 accounting restatements were reported by SEC reporting companies, including 4,246 restatements requiring reissuance of the affected financial statements, and there was a demonstrated negative near-term effect on the public market price of securities of many companies making such restatements.

Companies Lack Real-Time, Actionable Data from Their Accounting Departments
 As complexity, transaction volume and regulatory scrutiny increase, management teams often find themselves without clear and immediate insight into their accounting and finance processes and results. In most cases, the accounting department’s work is done within desktop applications or with the use of spreadsheets, leaving management with an incomplete view of their progress in closing, consolidating and reporting each period. By the time data is manually compiled, it is often days or weeks out-of-date, limiting the ability to effectively track and analyze fluctuations and trends, detailed metrics on individual and team performance, and transaction risk profiles in a timely manner.
 Such lack of visibility limits the ability of accounting managers to influence ongoing accounting operations. Instead, they are often relegated to conducting quality control measures after a process is completed. Important decisions may be made by less experienced employees and costly errors, such as unreconciled balances or unapproved fund transfers, may go undetected. In addition, the discipline of accounting frequently lacks established metrics by which to gauge performance.
 Accounting Professionals Face Compressed Deadlines and a Heightened Expectation of Accuracy
 Many organizations, and public companies in particular, have adopted a practice of reporting financial information by a fixed date following their quarter close. Given limited resources, an accelerated timetable can put immense pressure on a company’s accounting function. Accounting professionals are expected not only to address business and regulatory challenges but also to achieve completeness and accuracy of operating results to ensure financial integrity. Given these challenges and deadlines, accountants are often forced to leave certain accounts and transactions unreconciled, which can dramatically increase risk and create situations of concern for controllers, chief financial officers and audit committee members.
Traditional Accounting Processes and Tools are Inefficient
 The processes and software solutions traditionally employed by accountants, such as general ledgers and ERP systems, do not provide effective solutions for critical, non-general ledger accounting and finance processes such as balance sheet account reconciliation, intercompany transaction accounting and the overall management of the entire financial close process. Most core accounting and finance systems are designed as batch transaction repositories without the ability to consume and process continuous streams of data. In addition, most organizations use multiple ERPs and many other financial systems across their IT environments. Traditionally available accounting tools are inflexible, expensive to configure and maintain, and do not scale easily. As a result, we are addressing a clear need for new scalable accounting and finance tools that can consume data from a variety of sources, process it quickly with embedded business logic, provide a collaborative workspace for accountants, and then store information within a data warehouse or ERP system. Furthermore, accounting processes themselves have not evolved over time and instead remain focused on producing financial information only after period-end, ignoring the growing demand for a more streamlined, continuous approach to accounting.
The BlackLine Solution
 We provide a powerful cloud-based software platform designed to automate and streamline accounting and finance operations. The key elements of our solutions include:
 Comprehensive Platform
 We offer an integrated suite of applications that delivers a broad range of capabilities that would otherwise require the purchase and use of multiple products to support critical accounting processes such as the financial close, account reconciliations, intercompany accounting, and controls assurance. Our platform consists of eight core cloud-based products, including Transaction Matching, Account Reconciliations, Consolidation Integrity Manager, Daily Reconciliations, Journal Entry, Variance Analysis, Task Management and Insights. Customers typically purchase these products in packages that we refer to as solutions, but they have the option to purchase these products individually. Current solutions include Balance Sheet Integrity, Close Process Management, Accounting Process Automation, Finance Transformation, Intercompany Hub, and Smart Close.
 The technology underpinning our platform includes a comprehensive base of accounting-specific business logic and rules engines, which enable our customers to implement continuous accounting.

Enterprise Integration
 Our platform provides simple, secure and automated tools and integrations to transfer data to and from a range of enterprise-wide processes and systems, including ERPs, financial systems and in-house databases, and other custom applications and data. Our platform integrates with over 30 ERP systems, including NetSuite, Oracle, SAP, and Workday. In addition, for companies with multiple systems and complex needs, we can connect with any number of general ledger systems simultaneously, resolving many of the issues associated with consolidating data across systems.
Independence
 Our platform is not dependent on any single operating system and works with most major ERP systems our customers may use. Our cross-system functionality allows us to reach a broader group of customers. We are also able to focus on and innovate for the needs of the customers irrespective of updates or changes in their existing systems. We believe this independence provides us with a competitive advantage in the industry over traditional methods.
Ease of Use
 Our platform is designed by accountants, for accountants, to be intuitive and easy to use. We strive to enable any user to rapidly implement our platform to manage their accounting and finance activities, from the simplest to the most sophisticated tasks. Our user-friendly interface provides clear visualization of accounting and finance data, enables user collaboration and streamlines business processes.
Innovation
 Our ability to develop innovative products has been a key driver of our success and organic growth. Through a history and culture of thought leadership, we have created a new category of powerful software that automates and streamlines antiquated, manual accounting processes to better meet our clients’ diverse and rapidly changing needs, and we continue to focus on providing advanced solutions to time and labor intensive accounting practices. Examples of recent innovations include the launches of our Intercompany Hub solution, which is designed to manage all intercompany transactions through one centralized, cloud-based system, and the launch of our Insights solution, which provides real-time performance measures and a benchmarking dashboard.
Security
 The robust security features embedded in our platform are designed to meet or exceed both industry standards and the stringent security requirements of our customers. We engage independent security auditors to assess the effectiveness of our comprehensive information security program consisting of risk-driven policies and procedures.
Key Benefits
 Our platform is designed to provide the following benefits to our customers:
 Flexibility and scalability
 Our unified cloud platform is designed for modern business environments and has broad applicability across large and small organizations in almost any industry. The platform supports complex corporate structures, provides integration across all core financial systems, manages multiple currencies and languages, and scales to support high transaction volumes.
 Embedded controls and workflow
 Our platform was designed for the complex global regulatory environment. Our platform embeds key controls within standardized, repeatable and well-documented workflows, which are designed to result in substantially reduced risk of non-compliance or negative audit findings, greater tolerance for regulatory complexity and increased confidence in financial reports.

Real-time visibility
 We provide users with real-time visibility into the status, progress and quality of their accounting processes. With configurable dashboards, user-defined reporting and the ability to drill down to individual reconciliations, journals and tasks, users can track open items, identify bottlenecks within a process or intervene to prevent mistakes.
 Automation and efficiency
 Our platform can ingest data from a variety of sources, including ERP systems and other data repositories, and apply powerful, rules-driven automation to reconciliations, journals and transactions. This streamlines accounting processes, minimizes manual data entry and improves individual productivity to help ensure that accounting processes are completed on time. As a result, this automation allows users to focus on value-added activities instead of process management.
 Continuous processing
 Our platform helps organizations embed quality control, compliance and financial integrity into their day-to-day processes rather than rely on the traditional process of validating financial information at the end of each period. Activities such as account reconciliation and variance analysis can be performed in real-time, thus reducing the risk of errors and creating a more agile accounting environment.
 Our Growth Strategy
 We intend to continue investing in a number of growth initiatives to provide our customers with advanced solutions and to address and expand our market opportunity. Our principal growth strategies include the following:
Continue to Innovate and Expand Our Platform
 Our ability to develop new, market-leading applications and functionalities is integral to our success. We intend to continue extending the functionality and range of our applications to bring new and improved solutions to accounting and finance. Examples of recent innovations include the launch of our Intercompany Hub solution, which is designed to manage all intercompany transactions through one centralized, cloud-based system and the launch of our Insights solution, which provides real-time performance measures and a benchmarking dashboard.
Enhance Our Leadership Position in the Enterprise Market and Mid-Market Customer Base
 We believe we have a leading position in the enhanced financial controls and automation market with both enterprise market and mid-market customers, and we were recognized as a Leader by the Gartner Report in the 2017 Magic Quadrant for Cloud Financial Corporate Performance Management Solutions for our completeness of vision and ability to execute. We had more than 2,200 customers across a variety of industries and geographies at December 31, 2017 exclusive of on-premise software. Our customers include some of the largest multi-national enterprises, as well as leading medium and small businesses around the world. We intend to leverage our brand, history of innovation and customer focus to maintain and grow our leadership position with enterprise market customers. We believe that mid-market businesses are particularly underserved and that our platform can help these businesses modernize their accounting and finance processes efficiently and effectively. We have made recent investments to grow our mid-market sales team and plan to continue leveraging our network of resellers to grow our mid-market business globally.
Increase Customer Spend through Expanded Usage and Adoption of Additional Products
 We believe there is a significant opportunity to increase sales of our products within our existing customer base. We pursue a land-and-expand sales model to increase the use of our platform by selling additional solutions and features and increasing the number of users within our customers’ organizations. Our pricing model is designed to allow us to capture additional revenue as our customers’ usage of our platform grows, providing us with an opportunity to increase the lifetime value of our customer relationships.

Expand Our International Operations and Customer Footprint
 We believe that we have a significant opportunity to expand the use of our cloud-based products outside the United States.  We derived approximately 20%, 16%, and 14% of our revenues from sales outside the United States in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and we believe there are substantial opportunities to increase sales to customers outside of the U.S. In August 2016, we acquired Runbook primarily to enhance our position as a leading provider of software solutions to automate the financial close process for SAP customers and secondarily it supports our European expansion strategy.  We currently have users in over 150 countries, and our platform supports applicable international accounting standards, as well as 16 languages and all currencies specified by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO currencies.  We have an established presence in Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, Malaysia, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, and the United Kingdom, and we intend to invest in further expanding our footprint in these and other regions.
Extend Our Customer Relationships and Distribution Channels
 We have established strong strategic alliances with key industry participants to supplement marketing and delivery of our applications. These strategic alliances include agreements with technology vendors such as SAP and NetSuite, professional services firms such as Deloitte, Ernst & Young, and KPMG, and business process outsourcers, or BPOs, such as Cognizant, Genpact, and IBM.
 These relationships enable us to effectively market our solutions by offering a complementary suite of services to our customers. In particular, we offer our customers an integrated SAP-endorsed business solution through our relationship with SAP. We intend to continue to strengthen and expand our existing relationships, seek new relationships and further expand our distribution channels to help us expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.
 Customers
 Our customers include multinational corporations, large domestic enterprises and mid-market companies across a broad array of industries. These businesses include publicly-listed entities and privately-owned enterprises, as well as non-profit entities. At December 31, 2017, we had over 196,000 individual users in over 150 countries across more than 2,200 customers exclusive of on-premise software. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription agreement as of the measurement date. In situations where an organization has multiple subsidiaries or divisions, each entity that is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. However, where an existing customer requests its invoice be divided for the sole purpose of restructuring its internal billing arrangement without any incremental increase in revenue, such customer continues to be treated as a single customer. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, sales to enterprise customers represented 84%, 85%, and 86% of our revenues, respectively, while sales to mid-market customers represented 16%, 15%, and 14% of our revenues, respectively.
 Our customers operate in complex, diverse and often global information technology ecosystems with numerous general ledgers, sub-ledgers, treasury systems, and ERP systems from different vendors, including NetSuite, Oracle, SAP and Workday. Our platform is designed for and used by employees across the organization, including end users such as internal accounting employees, controllers and chief accounting officers, as well as chief financial officers and other senior executives and external auditors.
 We have seen our customers benefit from improvements in the complete automation process and staff productivity, in addition to a faster and more accurate financial close. Cost savings are achieved from the reconciliations of accounts, across approval and review roles, in process administration, and in audit, storage and paper expenses.
 Products and Services
 Our platform consists of eight core cloud-based products, including Transaction Matching, Account Reconciliations, Consolidation Integrity Manager, Daily Reconciliations, Journal Entry, Variance Analysis, Task Management and Insights. Customers typically purchase these products in packages that we refer to as solutions, but they have the option to purchase these products individually. Current solutions include Balance Sheet Integrity, Close Process Management, Accounting Process Automation, Finance Transformation, Intercompany Hub, and Smart Close.

Reconciliation Management
 The process of verifying and validating transactions, balances and consolidated financial results is referred to as account reconciliation. Our Reconciliation Management solution provides a framework for the reconciliation process, allowing users to build integrity checks and automation into the entire end-to-end work flow. The solution includes:

• | Account Reconciliations provides a centralized workspace from which users can collaborate to complete account reconciliations. Features include standardized templates, workflows for review and approval, linkage to policies and procedures, and integrated storage of supporting documentation. The product automates otherwise manual activities in the reconciliation process, significantly reducing time and effort and increasing productivity. It also enhances internal controls by facilitating the appropriate segregation of duties, simplifying reconciliation audits and adding transparency and visibility to the reconciliation process.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Transaction Matching analyzes and reconciles high volumes of individual transactions from different sources of data based upon user-configured logic. Our rules engine automatically identifies exceptions, errors, missing data, and variances within massive data sets. The matching engine processes millions of records per minute, can be used with any type of data and allows customers to reconcile transactions in real-time.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consolidation Integrity Manager manages the automated system-to-system tie-out process that occurs during the consolidation phase of the financial close. Companies with multiple ERPs utilize a consolidation system to produce their consolidated financial results. Because these systems contain and produce information that changes continually and requires constant adjustments, a final tie-out that is typically handled manually in a spreadsheet is necessary prior to publishing results. This product automates the tie-out process, aggregating balances from dozens or hundreds of different systems and allowing users to identify exceptions and create adjustments quickly.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Daily Reconciliations narrows the scope of a reconciliation to a single day’s transactions or balance detail. Users can then perform their analysis in minutes per day, rather than attempting to review an entire month’s worth of activity in a limited time during the period-end close. Some industries, such as banking, require that organizations track the creation and certification of daily reconciliations. Daily reconciliations are a prime example of continuous accounting in action.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Financial Close Management
 The collection of processes by which organizations reconcile, consolidate and report on their financial information at the end of each period is referred to as the financial close. Our Financial Close Management solution allows customers to manage the key steps within the close, applying automation where possible, and ensure that tasks are properly completed and reviewed. This solution includes the components of the Reconciliation Management solution, as well as the following products:

• | Task Management enables users to create and manage processes and task lists. The product provides automatic and recurring task scheduling, includes configurable workflow and provides a management console for accounting and finance projects. Though most commonly used with the financial close, users can create task lists and projects for hundreds of different use cases ranging from external audits to environmental impact surveys.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Journal Entry allows users to manually or automatically generate, review and post manual journal entries. Journals can be automatically allocated across multiple business units and calculated based on complex, client-defined logic. More importantly, the addition of validation and approval checkpoints helps ensure the integrity of information passed to other financial applications. Customers can use the Journal Entry product to pass information to hundreds of different ERPs and subsystems in a configurable, easily consumable format.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Variance Analysis provides “always-on” monitoring and automatically identifies anomalous fluctuations in balance sheet and income statement account balances. Once an account in flux is identified, users are automatically alerted so they can research and determine the source of the fluctuation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intercompany Hub
 Intercompany transactions occur when entities within a corporate parent organization transact with each other. These transactions are some of the most complex and frequent sources of uncertainty for the accounting function. Our Intercompany Hub solution, which was made generally available in November 2015, manages the entire intercompany transaction lifecycle within our platform and we believe it is the only widely available end-to-end intercompany solution. This solution includes the following features:

• | Intercompany Workflow replaces informal, ad-hoc intercompany requests and approvals with a simple, structured workflow approval process. The application stores permissions by entity and transaction type, ensuring that both the initiator and the approver of the intercompany transaction are authorized to conduct business.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Intercompany Processing records an organization’s intercompany transactions once they reach an appropriate completion level and posts them to the appropriate systems from a single source. The product automatically incorporates local taxes, exchange rates, invoicing requirements, and customer-specific transfer pricing so that the resulting journal entries will net, which reduces the possibility of intercompany differences and eliminates the need to perform a manual reconciliation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Netting and Settlement automatically generate a real-time, aggregated settlement matrix, which shows the balance of transactions across an entire organization. Users can filter the information by transaction type, currency or business relationship, easing the process of netting transactions and helping them make informed, strategic decisions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insights
 Our platform provides us with detailed information about the accounting and finance function for most of our cloud-based customers. Insights, which was made generally available in November 2015, aggregates and analyzes that information and can help clients assess productivity, risk and timeliness. We also provide a series of key performance indicators and allow clients to compare metrics across their own operating entities, set goals and gauge their performance over time. Insights provides benchmarking, scores for a variety of industries, company sizes, and geographies. These benchmarks are drawn from actual client usage of the application, rather than survey data, which provides valuable context for users.
Services
 Customer service is essential to our success. We offer the following services for our customers:
  
• | Implementation. With a focus on configuration over customization, our implementation approach favors rapid and efficient deployments led by accounting experts, rather than technical resources. A typical project will focus on mapping our application to a customer’s current or ideal process, coaching them on best practices, and helping organizations become self-sufficient, instead of dependent on additional professional services. For clients that elect to work with a business process outsourcer or other company for implementation services, our implementation team provides ongoing support in order to ensure that the implementation or finance transformation projects are completed successfully. We generally provide this service for a fixed fee.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Support. We provide live customer support 24/7/365 from our offices in Los Angeles, Sydney and London. All customers have access to support resources by phone, email or through our portal, free of charge.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer Success. Our customer success managers, many of whom are former users, provide customers with best practices and help create a roadmap for expanded usage of our platform. We believe that this service, which is made available to all customers, is central to our retention and upsell efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Training. We offer a variety of live and web-based training options, but most customers elect to consume their training through our e-learning environment, BlackLine U. Courses cover platform functionality, as well as the underlying concepts that make reconciliation, the financial close and other accounting and finance activities necessary.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Reliability. During 2017, we had one unscheduled downtime of 1 hour and 41 minutes on April 19, 2017 and 99.98% total availability, including scheduled maintenance. Client data is mirrored between primary and alternate data centers, providing effective redundancy and disaster recovery. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexibility. Our application architecture is modular, which allows us to quickly release new products or expand existing feature-sets by combining and configuring existing components. Our development has always been both rapid and responsive, which allows us to support a wide array of clients and bring new products to market while maintaining a consistent user interface and single, cohesive code base.

Security
 Due to the sensitive nature of the data we store for our clients, we place a heavy emphasis on security. Our infrastructure and software products are designed to meet and exceed rigorous security standards and to assure customers that we are taking appropriate measure to protect their data.
 We maintain a comprehensive information security management system that extends companywide and integrates into our core technology and business processes. This system includes deployment of a variety of detective, preventive and deterrent controls that include technical and administrative safeguards. The controls are regularly tested, both internally and by third-party audits and penetration tests. We are certified for compliance with the ISO 27001 framework, and we regularly undergo SSAE18, ISAE 3402 and SOC audits. We believe that we are in compliance with regulatory requirements and that we employ security best practices. A dedicated team of security professionals orchestrate our information security program. Our information security controls and practices include strong encryption for data at rest and in transit and extensive monitoring with comprehensive security incident detection and response process.

Operations
 We host our platform and solutions for our customers in data centers located in North America (Las Vegas, Nevada and Ashburn, Virginia) and Europe (Amsterdam, Netherlands and London, United Kingdom). We contract with SuperNap (Nevada), Equinix (Virginia), Verizon (Netherlands), and VMware (UK) for use of these data center facilities. These facilities provide extensive physical security, including manned security 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with video surveillance, redundant power and environmental controls, and technical controls, including biometric access. Network equipment, servers and applications are managed by our employees, and we staff a network operations center, or NOC, to monitor performance 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We regularly conduct risk and security assessments of these facilities and review their SSAE18, SOC and/or ISO 27001 attestations and certifications to ensure that our datacenter providers have adequate controls to maintain availability and security of our services.
Development
 Our research and development organization focuses on developing new software solutions and enhancing existing products, conducting software and quality assurance testing and improving our core technology. Our research and development organization is located primarily in our Los Angeles, California headquarters, where we are committed to recruiting, hiring and retaining top technical talent. We invest substantial resources in research and development to drive core technology innovation and to bring new products to market.
 Our research and development expenses were $23.9 million, $21.1 million, and $18.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were 13.5%, 17.2%, and 21.8% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
 Competition
 The market for accounting and financial software and services is competitive, rapidly evolving and requires deep understanding of the industry standards, accounting rules and global financial regulations.
 We compete with vendors of financial automation software such as Trintech, and we also compete with components of Oracle’s Hyperion software.
 We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
  
• | level of customer satisfaction;
--+--------------------------------


• | ease of deployment and use of applications;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | ability to integrate with multiple legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | domain expertise on accounting best practices;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | capability for configurability, integration and scalability of applications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cloud-based delivery model;
--+----------------------------


• | advanced security and reliability features;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | brand recognition and historical operating performance; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | price and total cost of ownership.
--+-----------------------------------

 We believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these factors. However, certain of our competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer and marketing relationships, larger marketing budgets, and significantly greater resources.
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. We currently have one pending patent application. We primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality or 
 13


license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our intellectual property rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
 Despite our efforts to preserve and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain portions of our software. Competitors may attempt to develop similar products that could compete in the same market as our products. Unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information by our employees or third parties could occur. Laws of other jurisdictions may not protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure in the same manner as the United States. The risk of unauthorized use of our proprietary and intellectual property rights may increase as our company continues to expand outside of the United States.
 Third-party infringement claims are also possible in our industry, especially as software functionality and features expand, evolve and overlap with other industry segments.
 Information about Segment and Geographic Revenue
 Information about segment and geographic revenue is set forth in Notes 2 and 16 of the “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Employees and Culture
 We believe our employees and culture are fundamental to our success. Therese Tucker, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, has led our company since its inception in 2001 and has built and maintained a culture committed to empowering our employees and communities around us. Our motto “Think. Create. Serve.” expresses our core values as a company dedicated to innovation and creativity, collaboration and action and service to each other and our customers.
 We seek to hire talented employees and are focused on their long-term development and training. We work to foster a collaborative, performance-driven working environment where integrity, open and honest communication and accountability are embraced and cultivated. By mixing these important features with an element of fun, we seek to maintain a satisfying workplace for our employees. We are proud of our recognition as a best place to work in the Los Angeles area in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.
 Many of our employees have previously worked for our customers. We believe this uniquely positions us to build compelling and effective products while also enhancing the user experience for our customers. Our desire to build a platform that creates value for all stakeholders in the accounting and financial process informs our decisions regarding product design and development.
 We also believe in making a positive impact on our communities. Each year during our annual Users Conference, we join with our customers to perform a day of community service — in 2016 and 2017, through a joint event with LA Mission, our employees, interested clients and partners volunteered their time to distribute food to local needy residents.  In 2014 and 2015, through joint events with Windy City Habitat for Humanity and Atlanta-based Habitat for Humanity, we helped to rebuild homes in the cities of Chicago and Atlanta.
 At December 31, 2017, we employed 740 people globally. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
