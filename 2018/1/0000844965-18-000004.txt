About TETRA
TETRA Technologies, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is a leading, geographically diversified oil and gas services company, focused on completion fluids and associated products and services, water management, frac flowback, production well testing, offshore rig cooling, and compression services and equipment. Prior to March 2018, our operations also included selected offshore services including well plugging and abandonment, decommissioning, and diving, as well as a limited domestic oil and gas production business. As of December 31, 2017 we were composed of five reporting segments organized into four divisions - Fluids, Production Testing, Compression, and Offshore.

Our Fluids Division manufactures and markets clear brine fluids, additives, and associated products and services to the oil and gas industry for use in well drilling, completion and workover operations in the United States and in certain countries in Latin America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The division also markets liquid and dry calcium chloride products manufactured at its production facilities or purchased from third-party suppliers to a variety of markets outside the energy industry. The Fluids Division also provides domestic onshore oil and gas operators with a wide variety of water management services.
Our Production Testing Division provides frac flowback, production well testing, offshore rig cooling, and other associated services and early production facilities (EPFs) in many of the major oil and gas producing regions in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, as well as in oil and gas basins in certain regions in South America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Australia.
Our Compression Division is a provider of compression services and equipment for natural gas and oil production, gathering, transportation, processing, and storage. The Compression Division's equipment sales business includes the fabrication and sale of standard compressor packages, custom-designed compressor packages and oilfield pump systems designed and fabricated at the division's facilities. The Compression Division's aftermarket business provides compressor package reconfiguration and maintenance services and compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. The Compression Division provides its services and equipment to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, transmission, and storage companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States, as well as in a number of foreign countries, including Mexico, Canada and Argentina. 
Our Offshore Division consists of two operating segments, both of which were disposed on March 1, 2018: Offshore Services and Maritech. The Offshore Services segment provided services primarily to the offshore oil and gas industry, consisting of: (1) downhole and subsea services, such as well plugging and abandonment and 
1

inspection, repair and maintenance services; (2) decommissioning and certain construction services utilizing heavy lift barges and various cutting technologies with regard to offshore oil and gas production platforms and pipelines; and (3) conventional and saturation diving services. For additional information regarding the sale of the Offshore Division, see "Note C - Acquisitions and Dispositions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Maritech segment was a limited oil and gas production operation. During 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, Maritech sold substantially all of its oil- and gas-producing property interests. Maritech’s operations consisted primarily of the ongoing abandonment and decommissioning associated with its remaining offshore wells and production platforms. 

We continue to pursue a long-term growth strategy that includes expanding our continuing core businesses, which excludes our recently disposed Offshore Services and Maritech segments, through internal growth and acquisitions, domestically and internationally. For financial information for each of our segments, including information regarding revenues and total assets, see “Note Q - Industry Segments and Geographic Information” contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Products and Services 

Fluids Division
Liquid calcium chloride, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, sodium bromide, and blends of such products manufactured by our Fluids Division are referred to as clear brine fluids ("CBFs") in the oil and gas industry. CBFs are salt solutions that have variable densities and are used to control bottom-hole pressures during oil and gas completion and workover operations. The Fluids Division sells CBFs and various CBF additives to U.S. and foreign oil and gas exploration and production companies and to other companies that service customers in the oil and gas industry.

The Fluids Division provides both stock and custom-blended CBFs based on each customer's specific needs and the proposed application. The Fluids Division provides a broad range of associated CBF services, including: on-site fluids filtration, handling and recycling; wellbore cleanup; fluid engineering consultation; and fluid management services. The Fluids Division's newest CBF technology, TETRA CS Neptune® completion fluids, are high-density, solids-, zinc- and formate-free completion fluids. They were developed by TETRA to be environmentally friendly and cost-effective alternatives to traditional zinc bromide and cesium formate high-density completion fluids for use in well completion and workover operations, as well as a low-solids reservoir drilling fluid.
We offer to repurchase (buyback) certain used CBFs from customers, which we are able to recondition and recycle. Selling used CBFs back to us reduces the net cost of the CBFs to our customers and minimizes our customers’ need to dispose of used fluids. We recondition used CBFs through filtration, blending and the use of proprietary chemical processes, and then market the reconditioned CBFs.

By blending different stock CBFs and using various additives, we are able to modify the specific density, crystallization temperature, and chemical composition of the CBFs as necessary. The division’s fluid engineering personnel determine the optimal CBF blend for a customer’s particular application to maximize its effectiveness and lifespan. Our filtration services use a variety of techniques and equipment to remove particulates from CBFs at the customer’s site so that the CBFs can be reused. Filtration also enables recovery of a greater percentage of used CBFs for reconditioning.

The Fluids Division also provides a wide variety of water management services that support hydraulic fracturing in unconventional well completions for domestic onshore oil and gas operators. These services include fresh and produced water analysis, treatment, storage, transfer, engineering, recycling, and environmental risk mitigation. The Fluids Division's patented equipment and processes include BioRid® treatment services, certain blending technologies, and TETRA STEELTM 1200 rapid deployment water transfer system. The Fluids Division seeks to design environmentally friendly solutions for the unique needs of each customer’s wellsite in order to maximize operational performance, and efficiency and minimize the use of fresh water. These include tailored “Last Mile” infrastructure - which consists of water storage ponds, movable storage tanks, a network of water transfer lines including TETRA STEEL™ lay-flat hose, TETRA Blend™ automated transfer and blending of produced water, and oil recovery from produced water via the TETRA Orapt™ mobile oil separator system - to transfer water around the well pads in a safe, efficient and environmentally responsible manner.

On February 28, 2018, pursuant to a purchase agreement dated February 13, 2018 (the 'SwiftWater Purchase Agreement"), we purchased all of the equity interests in SwiftWater Energy Services, LLC ("SwiftWater"), which is engaged in the business of providing water management and water solutions to oil and gas operators in the Permian Basin market of Texas. SwiftWater provides a diverse range of water management equipment and services for operators in the Permian Basin, offering an integrated line of services ranging from lay-flat hose water transfer, water treatment, above-ground water storage for fresh and produced water applications, secondary frac tank containment, poly pipe, pit lining rentals, and supporting ancillary equipment. For additional information regarding the acquisition of SwiftWater, see "Note C - Acquisitions and Dispositions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Fluids Division manufactures liquid and dry calcium chloride and liquid calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, and sodium bromide for distribution, primarily into energy markets. Liquid and dry calcium chloride are also sold into water treatment, industrial, cement, food processing, road maintenance, ice melt, agricultural, and consumer products markets. Sodium bromide is also sold into industrial water treatment markets, where it is used as a biocide in recirculated cooling tower waters and in other applications.
Our calcium chloride manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Finland. We also acquire calcium chloride inventory from other producers. In the United States, we manufacture calcium chloride at five manufacturing plant facilities, the largest of which is our plant near El Dorado, Arkansas, which produces liquid and flake calcium chloride products and sodium chloride. Liquid and flake calcium chloride are also produced at our Kokkola, Finland, plant. We operate our European calcium chloride operations under the name TETRA Chemicals Europe. We also manufacture liquid calcium chloride at our facilities in Parkersburg, West Virginia and Lake Charles, Louisiana, and we have two solar evaporation facility locations located in San Bernardino County, California, that produce liquid calcium chloride and sodium chloride from underground brine reserves, which are naturally replenished. All of our calcium chloride production facilities have a combined production capacity of more than 1.5 million equivalent liquid tons per year.
Our Fluids Division manufactures liquid calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide and sodium bromide at our West Memphis, Arkansas facility. A patented and proprietary process utilized at this facility uses bromine and zinc to manufacture zinc bromide. This facility also uses proprietary processes to manufacture calcium bromide and sodium bromide and to recondition and upgrade used CBFs that we have repurchased from our customers.

See “Note Q - Industry Segments and Geographic Information” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about the Fluids Division.

Production Testing Division

Our Production Testing Division provides frac flowback services, early production facilities and services, production well testing services, offshore rig cooling services, and other associated services, including well flow management and evaluation services that enable operators to quantify oil and gas reserves, optimize oil and gas production and minimize oil and gas reservoir damage. In certain gas-producing basins, water, sand and other abrasive materials commonly accompany the initial production of natural gas, often under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions and, in some cases, from reservoirs containing high levels of hydrogen sulfide gas. The Production Testing Division provides the specialized equipment and qualified personnel to address these impediments to production. Early production services typically include sophisticated evaluation techniques for reservoir management, including unconventional shale reservoir exploitation and optimization of well workover programs. Frac flowback and production well testing services may include well control, well cleanup and laboratory analysis. These services are utilized in the completion process after hydraulic fracturing and in the production phase of oil and gas wells.

Our Production Testing Division maintains one of the largest fleets of high-pressure production testing equipment in the United States, including equipment designed to work in environments where high levels of hydrogen sulfide gas are present. The division has domestic operating locations in Colorado, Louisiana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming. The division also has locations in Canada, and in certain countries in South America, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Production Testing operations in Canada are provided through our subsidiary, Greywolf Energy Services ("Greywolf").

Our Compression Division is a provider of compression services and equipment for natural gas and oil production, gathering, transportation, processing, and storage. The Compression Division fabricates and sells standard and custom-designed compressor packages, as well as oilfield fluid pump systems, and provides aftermarket services and compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. The majority of the Compression Division’s service compression fleet is monitored 24/7 via satellite telemetry from Fleet Reliability Centers (FRC) located at The Woodlands, Texas-based corporate office and the Midland, Texas-based packaging facility. The Compression Division provides its compression services and equipment to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, transmission and storage companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States, Canada and Mexico, as well as certain countries in South America.
The Compression Division is one of the largest providers of natural gas compression services in the United States. The compression and related services business includes a service fleet of approximately 5,800 compressor packages providing approximately 1.1 million in aggregate horsepower, utilizing a full spectrum of low-, medium-, and high-horsepower engines. Low-horsepower compressor packages enhance production for dry gas wells and liquid-loaded gas wells by deliquifying wells, lowering wellhead pressure, and increasing gas velocity. Our low-horsepower compressor packages are also utilized in connection with oil and liquids production and in vapor recovery and casing gas system applications. Low- to medium-horsepower compressor packages are typically utilized in wellhead, gathering, and other applications primarily in connection with oil and liquids production. Our high-horsepower compressor package offerings are typically utilized for natural gas production, natural gas gathering, centralized compression facilities and midstream applications. 
The horsepower of our compression services fleet on December 31, 2017, is summarized in the following table:

0 - 100 | 3,842 | 180,156 | 16.7 | %
101 - 800 | 1,590 | 444,520 | 41.1 | %
Over 800 | 341 | 457,243 | 42.3 | %
Total | 5,773 | 1,081,919 | 100.0 | %

Our Compression Division's equipment sales business includes the fabrication and sale of standard compressor packages, custom-designed compressor packages and oilfield fluid pump systems that are designed and fabricated primarily at its facility in Midland, Texas. Our compressor packages are typically sold to natural gas and oil exploration and production, mid-stream, transmission, and storage companies for use in various applications including gas gathering, gas lift, carbon dioxide injection, wellhead compression, gas storage, refrigeration plant, gas processing, pressure maintenance, pipeline, vapor recovery, gas transmission, fuel gas booster, and coal bed methane systems. We design and fabricate natural gas reciprocating and rotary compressor packages up to 8,000 horsepower for use in our service fleet and for sale to our broadened customer base. Our pump systems can be utilized in numerous applications including oil production, transfer and pipelines, as well as water injection and disposal.
The Compression Division's aftermarket business provides a wide range of services and compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers to support the needs of customers who own compression equipment. These services include operations, maintenance, overhaul and reconfiguration services, which may be provided under turnkey engineering, procurement and construction contracts. This business employs 
4

factory trained sales and support personnel in most of the major oil- and natural gas-producing basins in the United States to perform these services.
Virtually all of our Compression Division's operations are conducted through our partially owned subsidiary, CSI Compressco LP ("CCLP"). Through our wholly owned subsidiary, CSI Compressco GP Inc., we manage and control CCLP, and accordingly, we consolidate CCLP results of operation in our consolidated results of operation. As of December 31, 2017, common units held by the public represented approximately a 60% common unit ownership interest in CCLP.
See “Note Q - Industry Segments and Geographic Information” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about the Compression Division.
Offshore Division

Our Offshore Division consists of two operating segments: Offshore Services and Maritech. On March 1, 2018, we closed a series of related transactions that resulted in the disposition of these two businesses. Pursuant to an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "Maritech Asset Purchase Agreement") with Orinoco Natural Resources, LLC ("Orinoco") Orinoco purchased certain offshore oil, gas and mineral leases and related assets of Maritech (the "Maritech Properties"). Immediately thereafter, we closed a Membership Interest Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "Maritech Equity Purchase Agreement") with Orinoco, whereby Orinoco purchased all of the equity interests of Maritech (the "Maritech Equity Interests"). Immediately thereafter, we closed an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement (the "Offshore Services Purchase Agreement") with Epic Offshore Specialty, LLC, an affiliate of Orinoco ("Epic Offshore"), whereby Epic Offshore purchased (the "Offshore Services Sale") all of the equity in TSB Offshore, Inc. and TETRA Applied Technologies, LLC, which owns all of the equity interests in Epic Diving & Marine Services, LLC, which are the wholly owned subsidiaries that comprise our Offshore Services segment operations (the "Offshore Services Equity Interests"). 
Under the terms of the Maritech Asset Purchase Agreement, the Maritech Equity Purchase Agreement, and the Offshore Services Purchase Agreement, the consideration delivered by Orinoco and Epic Offshore for the Maritech Properties, the Maritech Equity Interests and the Offshore Services Equity Interests consisted of (i) the assumption by Orinoco of all of the liabilities and obligations relating to the ownership, operation and condition of the Maritech Properties and the provision of certain indemnities by Orinoco to us under the Maritech Asset Purchase Agreement, (ii) the assumption by Orinoco of all of the liabilities of Maritech and the provision of certain indemnities by Orinoco under the Maritech Equity Purchase Agreement, (iii) the assumption by Epic Offshore of substantially all of the liabilities of the Offshore Services Equity Interests relating to the periods following the closing of the Offshore Services Sale and the provision of certain indemnities by Epic Offshore under the Offshore Services Purchase Agreement, (iv) cash in the amount $3.1 million which is equal to the value of the fuel in the vessels owned by Offshore Services as of the closing plus the value (determined to be sixty percent of the amount paid by Offshore Services therefore) of all usable spare parts and supply inventory of Offshore Services, (v) a promissory note in the original principal amount of $7.5 million payable by Epic Offshore to us in full, together with interest at a rate of 1.52% per annum, on December 31, 2019, (vi) performance by Orinoco under a Bonding Agreement executed in connection with the Maritech Asset Purchase Agreement and the Maritech Equity Purchase Agreement whereby Orinoco provided at closing non-revocable performance bonds in an amount equal to $46.8 million to cover the performance by Orinoco and Maritech of the asset retirement obligations of Maritech, to be replaced within 90 days of the closing with non-revocable performance bonds, meeting certain requirements, in the sum of $47.0 million, and (vii) the delivery of a personal guaranty agreement from Thomas M. Clarke and Ana M. Clarke guaranteeing the payment obligations of Orinoco under the Bonding Agreement (collectively, the "Transaction Consideration"). See "Note C - Acquisitions and Dispositions" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about the February 2018 sale of the Offshore Division.
As a result of these transactions, we have effectively exited the businesses of our Offshore Services and Maritech segments. 
Offshore Services Segment. The Offshore Services segment provided: (1) downhole and subsea services, such as well plugging and abandonment and inspection, repair and maintenance services; (2) decommissioning and certain construction services utilizing heavy lift barges and various cutting technologies with regard to offshore oil and gas production platforms and pipelines; and (3) conventional and saturation diving services. We provided these services to offshore oil and gas operators, primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We offered comprehensive integrated services, including individualized engineering consultation and project management services.
5

Maritech Segment. The Maritech segment was a limited oil and gas production operation in the offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico. During 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, Maritech sold substantially all of its proved reserves. Subsequent to these sales of proved reserves, Maritech’s remaining operations consisted primarily of the ongoing abandonment and decommissioning of its remaining offshore wells, facilities and production platforms. As part of the sale of our Offshore Division in March 2018, Orinoco purchased Maritech and its remaining oil and gas leases and assumed all of Maritech's abandonment and decommissioning obligations.

The sales of substantially all of Maritech’s oil and gas producing properties during 2011 and 2012 essentially removed us from the oil and gas exploration and production business, and significantly all of Maritech’s oil and gas acquisition, development and exploitation activities ceased. Since the sales of its proved reserves, Maritech’s remaining oil and gas reserves and production were negligible. Prior to March 1, 2018, Maritech’s operations consisted primarily of the well abandonment and decommissioning of its remaining offshore oil and gas platforms and facilities. During the three year period ended December 31, 2017, Maritech spent approximately $14.9 million on such efforts. Approximately $46.7 million of Maritech decommissioning liabilities remained as of December 31, 2017, and such liabilities were assumed by Orinoco as part of the sale of the Offshore Division.
Maritech’s decommissioning liabilities are established based on what it estimates a third party would charge to plug and abandon the wells, decommission the pipelines and platforms, and clear the sites associated with its properties. For a further discussion of Maritech’s historical adjustments to its decommissioning liabilities, see “Note I - Decommissioning and Other Asset Retirement Obligations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

See “Note Q - Industry Segments and Geographic Information” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about the Offshore Division.

Sources of Raw Materials

Our Fluids Division manufactures calcium chloride, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, and sodium bromide for sale to its customers. The Fluids Division also recycles used calcium bromide and zinc bromide CBFs repurchased from its oil and gas customers.

The Fluids Division manufactures liquid calcium chloride, either from underground brine or by reacting hydrochloric acid with limestone. The Fluids Division also purchases liquid and dry calcium chloride from a number of U.S. and foreign chemical manufacturers. Our El Dorado, Arkansas, plant produces liquid and flake calcium chloride and sodium chloride, utilizing underground brine (tail brine) obtained from Lanxess AG ("Lanxess," which acquired Chemtura Corporation during 2017) that contains calcium chloride and sodium chloride. We also produce calcium chloride and sodium chloride at our two facility locations in San Bernardino County, California, by solar evaporation of pumped underground brine reserves that contain calcium chloride. The underground reserves of this brine are deemed adequate to supply our foreseeable need for calcium chloride at those plants.

The Fluids Division's primary sources of hydrochloric acid are co-product streams obtained from chemical manufacturers. Substantial quantities of limestone are also consumed when converting hydrochloric acid into calcium chloride. Currently, hydrochloric acid and limestone are generally available from multiple sources.

To produce calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, and sodium bromide at our West Memphis, Arkansas, facility, we use bromine, hydrobromic acid, zinc and lime as raw materials. There are multiple sources of zinc that we can use in the production of zinc bromide and zinc calcium bromide. We have a long-term supply agreement with Lanxess, under which the Fluids Division purchases its requirements of raw material bromine from Lanxess’s Arkansas bromine facilities. In addition, we have a long-term agreement with Lanxess under which Lanxess supplies the Fluids’ El Dorado, Arkansas, calcium chloride plant with raw material tail brine from its Arkansas bromine production facilities.

We also own a calcium bromide manufacturing plant near Magnolia, Arkansas, which was constructed in 1985. This plant was acquired in 1988 and is not operable. We currently lease approximately 30,000 gross acres of bromine-containing brine reserves in the vicinity of this plant. While this plant is designed to produce calcium bromide, it could be modified to produce elemental bromine or select bromine compounds. Development of the brine field, construction of necessary pipelines and reconfiguration of the plant would require a substantial capital investment. The long-term Lanxess bromine supply agreement discussed above provides us with a secure supply 
6

of bromine to support the division’s current operations. We do, however, continue to evaluate our strategy related to the Magnolia, Arkansas, assets and their future development. Lanxess has certain rights to participate in future development of the Magnolia, Arkansas assets.

The Fluids and Production Testing Divisions purchase their water management, production testing, and rig cooling equipment and components from third-party manufacturers. CCLP designs and fabricates its reciprocating and rotary screw compressor packages and pumps with components obtained from third party suppliers. These components represent a significant portion of the cost of the compressor packages and pump systems. Some of the components used in the assembly of compressor packages, well monitoring, sand separation, production testing, and rig cooling equipment are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We do not have long-term contracts with these suppliers or manufacturers. Should we experience unavailability of the components we use to assemble our equipment, we believe there are adequate alternative suppliers and any impact to us would not be severe. CCLP occasionally experiences long-lead times for components from suppliers and, therefore, may at times make purchases in anticipation of future orders.
Market Overview and Competition
Our operations are significantly dependent upon the demand for, and production of, natural gas and oil in the various domestic and international locations in which we operate. Beginning in 2014, and continuing throughout most of 2016, reduced prices of natural gas and oil led to declines in our customers' drilling activities and capital expenditure levels in the domestic and international markets in which we operate. The decline in activity in the natural gas and oil exploration and production industry resulted in reduced demand for certain of our products and services compared to early 2014 levels. With the increase in oil and gas pricing that continued throughout most of 2017 and early 2018, we are seeing indicators of improving demand in the North America and international markets, while offshore activity remains flat year-over-year.
Fluids Division

Our Fluids Division provides its products and services to oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States and certain foreign markets, and to other customers that service such companies. Current areas of market presence include the onshore U.S., the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, Mexico, and certain countries in South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Customers with deepwater operations frequently utilize high volumes of CBFs, which can be subject to harsh downhole conditions, such as high pressure and high temperatures. Demand for CBF products offshore is generally driven by completion activity.

Since 2014, there has been increased industry demand for onshore water management services in unconventional shale gas and oil reservoirs in connection with hydraulic fracturing operations. However, beginning in 2015, demand for certain Fluids Division products and services, particularly water management services, was adversely affected by declining oil and natural gas pricing and customer budgetary constraints. Throughout 2017, demand for our North American onshore water management services increased as oil and natural gas prices rose. The Fluids Division provides water management services to a wide-range of onshore oil and gas operators located in all active North America unconventional oil and gas basins. The acquisition of SwiftWater expands our market share in the Permian Basin, which is one of the fastest growing basins for oilfield services globally, by adding significant capacity as well as incremental products and services, with nominal customer overlap.

Our Fluids Division’s principal competitors in the sale of CBFs to the oil and gas industry are Baker Hughes, Baroid, a subsidiary of Halliburton, and M-I Swaco, a subsidiary of Schlumberger. This market is highly competitive, and competition is based primarily on service, availability, and price. Major customers of the Fluids Division include Anadarko, Chesapeake, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, Encana, EOG Resources, ExxonMobil, Halliburton, LLOG Exploration, Oklahoma Energy Corp., Petrobras, Pioneer Natural Resources, Saudi Aramco, Schlumberger, Shell, Southwestern Energy, Total, Tullow, W & T Offshore, and YPF. The Fluids Division also sells its CBF products through various distributors. Competitors for the division’s water management services include large, multinational providers as well as small, privately owned operators.

Our liquid and dry calcium chloride products have a wide range of uses outside the energy industry. Non-energy market segments where these products are used include water treatment, industrial, food processing, road maintenance, ice melt, agricultural, and consumer products. We also sell sodium bromide into industrial water treatment markets as a biocide under the BioRid® tradename. Most of these markets are highly competitive. The Fluids Division’s European calcium chloride operations market our calcium chloride products to certain European 
7

markets. Our principal competitors in the non-energy related calcium chloride markets include Occidental Chemical Corporation and Vitro in North America and NedMag in Europe.

Production Testing Division 

Our Production Testing Division provides frac flowback services, early production facilities and services, production well testing services, offshore rig cooling services, and other associated services in various onshore domestic and international locations. The Production Testing Division serves all active North America unconventional oil and gas basins. Through Greywolf, the division serves the western Canada market. In addition, through our OPTIMA subsidiary, the Production Testing Division offers offshore oil and gas rig cooling services and associated products that suppress heat generated by high-rate flaring of hydrocarbons during offshore well testing operations. OPTIMA primarily serves markets in the North Sea, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and South America. 
The U.S. and Canadian production testing markets are highly competitive, and competition is based on availability of appropriate equipment and qualified personnel, as well as price, quality of service, and safety record. We believe that our skilled personnel, operating procedures and safety record give us a competitive advantage. Competition in onshore U.S. and Canadian production testing markets is primarily dominated by numerous small, privately owned operators. Expro International, Halliburton, and Schlumberger, are major competitors in the foreign markets we serve although, we provide these services to their customers on a subcontract basis from time to time. The major customers for this division include Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Eclipse Resources, Encana, EP Energy, EQT, Expro, Peyto, Pioneer Natural Resources, Range Resources, Rice Energy, Saudi Aramco, Schlumberger, Shell, and Vantage Energy.
Compression Division
The Compression Division provides its products and services to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, pipeline transmission, and storage companies, operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States. The Compression Division also has operations in Latin America and other foreign regions. While most of the Compression Division's services are performed throughout Texas, the San Juan Basin, the Rocky Mountain region and the Midcontinent region of the United States, we also have a presence in other U.S. producing regions. The Compression Division continues to seek opportunities to further expand its operations into other regions in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
This division’s strategy is to compete on the basis of superior services at a competitive price. The Compression Division believes that it is competitive because of the significant increases in the value that results from the use of its services, its superior customer service, its highly trained field personnel and the quality of the compressor packages it uses to provide services. The Compression Division’s major customers include Anadarko, Cimarex Energy, ConocoPhillips, Denbury Onshore, and Targa Resources.
The compression services and compressor package fabrication business is highly competitive. Certain of the Compression Division's competitors may be able to more quickly adapt to changes within the compression industry and changes in economic conditions as a whole, more readily take advantage of available opportunities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Primary competition for our low-horsepower compression services business comes from various local and regional companies that utilize packages consisting of a screw compressor with a separate engine driver or a reciprocating compressor with a separate engine driver. These local and regional competitors tend to compete with us on the basis of price as opposed to our focus on providing production enhancement value to the customer. Competition for the mid- and high-horsepower compression services business comes primarily from large national and multinational companies that may have greater financial resources than ours. Such competitors include ArchRock, AXIP Energy Services, CDM Resource Management, Exterran, J-W Power, and USA Compression. Our competition in the standard compressor package fabrication and sales market includes several large companies and a large number of small, regional fabricators, including some of those who we compete with for compression services, as well as AG Equipment Company, Enerflex, SEC Energy Products & Services, and others. The Compression Division's competition in the custom-designed compressor package market usually consists of larger companies that have the ability to address integrated projects and provide product support after the sale. The ability to fabricate these large custom-designed packages at the Compression Division's facilities, which is near the point of end-use of many customers, is often a competitive advantage.

Offshore Division

Offshore Services Segment. Demand for the Offshore Services segment’s offshore well abandonment and decommissioning services in the Gulf of Mexico is primarily driven by the maturity and decline of producing fields, aging offshore platform infrastructure, damage to platforms and pipelines from hurricanes and other windstorms, and government regulations, among other factors. Demand for the Offshore Services segment’s construction and other services is driven by the general level of offshore activity of its customers, which is affected by oil and natural gas prices and government regulation. Offshore activities in the Gulf of Mexico are seasonal, with the majority of work occurring during the months of April through October when weather conditions are most favorable. Critical factors required to compete in this market include, among other factors: (i) the proper equipment, including vessels and heavy lift barges; (ii) qualified, experienced personnel; (iii) technical expertise to address varying downhole, surface and subsea conditions, particularly those related to damaged wells and platforms; and (iv) a comprehensive health, safety and environmental program. Our Offshore Services segment's fleet of owned equipment includes two heavy lift derrick barges, the TETRA Hedron, which has a 1,600-metric-ton lift capacity, fully revolving crane and the TETRA Arapaho, which has a 725-metric-ton lift capacity. We believe that the integrated services that we offer and our vessel and equipment fleets satisfy current market requirements in the Gulf of Mexico and allow us to successfully compete in that market.

The Offshore Services segment markets its services primarily to major oil and gas companies and independent operators. One of the Offshore Services segment’s most significant customers historically has been Maritech; however, the amount of work performed for Maritech has been reduced in recent years and the amount of work to be performed in the future for Maritech is expected to continue to decline. Major customers include, Fieldwood Energy, Shell, Stone Energy, Talos Energy, and W&T Offshore. The Offshore Services segment’s services are performed primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, however, the segment has provided services in the Mexican Gulf of Mexico and in the Asia-Pacific region and is seeking to expand its operations to international markets. Our principal competitors in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico market are Chet Morrison Contractors, Manson Gulf, Montco Oilfield Contractors, Oceaneering, Ranger Offshore, and Superior Energy Services, Inc. This market is highly competitive, and competition is based primarily on service, equipment availability, safety record, and price. 
No single customer provided 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Other Business Matters

Backlog

The Compression Division’s equipment sales business consist of the fabrication and sale of standard compressor packages, custom-designed compressor packages, and oilfield fluid pump systems that are fabricated to customer specifications and standard specifications, as applicable. The Division's custom-designed compressor packages are typically greater in size and complexity than standard fabrication packages, requiring more labor, materials, and overhead resources. This business requires diligent planning of those resources and project and backlog management in order to meet the customers' desired delivery dates and performance criteria, and achieve fabrication efficiencies. As of December 31, 2017, the Compression Division's equipment sales backlog was $47.5 million, all of which is expected to be recognized in 2018, based on title passing to the customer, the customer assuming the risks of ownership, reasonable assurance of collectability, and delivery occurring as directed by our customer. This backlog consists of firm customer orders for which a purchase or work order has been received, satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist, and delivery has been scheduled. This backlog is a measure of marketing effectiveness that allows us to plan future labor and raw material needs and to measure our success in winning bids from our customers. Following a record single $66.7 million sales order received from a customer in early 2018, the Compression Division's equipment sales backlog has further increased significantly after December 31, 2017.
Other than these Compression Division operations, our products and services generally are either not sold under long-term contracts or do not require long lead times to procure or deliver.
Employees

As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 2,600 employees. None of our U.S. employees are presently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Our foreign employees are generally members of labor 
9

unions and associations in the countries in which they are employed. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.

Patents, Proprietary Technology and Trademarks

As of December 31, 2017, we owned or licensed fifty-six (56) issued U.S. patents and had seven (7) patent applications pending in the United States. Twenty five (25) of the U.S. patents and the seven (7) patent applications pending in the U.S. are held by our Offshore Services segment, which was disposed in March 2018. We also had forty-five (45) owned or licensed patents and seven (7) patent applications pending in various other countries. Eight (8) of the foreign patents and one of the foreign patent applications are held by our Offshore Services segment. The foreign patents and patent applications are primarily foreign counterparts to certain of our U.S. patents or patent applications. The issued patents expire at various times through 2035. We have elected to maintain certain other internally developed technologies, know-how, and inventions as trade secrets. While we believe that our patents and trade secrets are important to our competitive positions in our businesses, we do not believe any one patent or trade secret is essential to our success.

It is our practice to enter into confidentiality agreements with key employees, consultants and third parties to whom we disclose our confidential and proprietary information, and we have typical policies and procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of such information. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets and expertise, or that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets or expertise.

We sell various products and services under a variety of trademarks and service marks, some of which are registered in the United States or other countries.

Health, Safety, and Environmental Affairs Regulations

We believe that our service and sales operations and manufacturing plants are in substantial compliance with all applicable U.S. and foreign health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. We are committed to conducting all of our operations under the highest standards of safety and respect for the environment. However, risks of substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in certain of our operations and in the development and handling of certain products and equipment produced or used at our plants, well locations, and worksites. Because of these risks, there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future. Changes in environmental and health and safety regulations could subject us to more rigorous standards. We cannot predict the extent to which our operations may be affected by future regulatory and enforcement policies.
We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to health, safety, and the environment, including regulations regarding air emissions, wastewater and storm water discharges, and the disposal of certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. Compliance with laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities, and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or associated permits may result in the assessment of fines and penalties and the imposition of other obligations.

Our operations in the United States are subject to various evolving environmental laws and regulations that are enforced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"); the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement ("BSEE") of the U.S. Department of the Interior; the U.S. Coast Guard; and various other federal, state, and local environmental authorities. Similar laws and regulations, designed to protect the health and safety of our employees and visitors to our facilities, are enforced by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other state and local agencies and authorities. Specific environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations include: (i) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972; (ii) the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976; (iii) the Clean Air Act of 1977; (iv) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"); (v) the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986; (vi) the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act of 1947; (vii) the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976; (viii) the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975; (ix) and the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990. Our operations outside the United States are subject to various foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, and other regulated activities in the countries in which we operate.

 We routinely deal with natural gas, oil, and other petroleum products. Hydrocarbons or other hazardous wastes may have been released during our operations or by third parties on wellhead sites where we provide 
10

services or store our equipment or on or under other locations where wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties may be subject to investigatory, remediation, and monitoring requirements under foreign, federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants from reciprocal internal combustion engines and more recently the EPA adopted regulations that establish air emission controls for natural gas and natural gas liquids production, processing and transportation activities, including New Source Performance Standards as well as emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants. Certain CSI compressors are subject to these new requirements and additional control equipment and maintenance operations are required. While we do not believe that compliance with current regulatory requirements will have a material adverse effect on the business, additional regulations could impose new air permitting or pollution control requirements on our equipment that could require us to incur material costs.
The modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations, or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also adversely affect oil and natural gas exploration and production, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us.
We maintain various types of insurance intended to reimburse us for certain costs in the event of an accident, including an explosion or similar event involving our offshore operations. Our insurance program is reviewed not less than annually with our insurance brokers and underwriters. As part of our insurance program for offshore operations, we maintain Commercial General Liability, Protection and Indemnity, and Excess Liability policies that provide third-party liability coverage, including but not limited to death and personal injury, collision, damage to property including fixed and floating objects, pollution, and wreck removal up to the applicable policy limits. Additionally, related to our Offshore Services operations which we disposed in March 2018, we maintained a vessel pollution liability policy that provides coverage for oil or hazardous substance pollution emanating from a vessel, addressing both Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA") and CERCLA obligations. This policy also provides coverage for cost of defense, and limited coverage for fines, and penalties up to the applicable policy limits.
We provided services and products to customers in the Gulf of Mexico, generally pursuant to written master services agreements that created insurance and indemnity obligations for both parties. Following the March 2018 sale of our Offshore Division, Orinoco has assumed substantially all of the liabilities of our Offshore Division.
