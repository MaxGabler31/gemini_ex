   BUSINESS OVERVIEW
  The current focus of Shoal Games is the development and marketing of Rooplay, an innovative platform of interactive games for families and children.
  Product Strategy
  Rooplay is a Netflix of games for children and families.  Rooplay has no ads, no in-app purchases, no long downloads, no instant messaging, and no outbound links of any form.  These characteristics make the product a unique platform of game content that is entirely safe for children.
  Rooplay generates revenue from consumer subscriptions which are paid to access the Rooplay library of games.  Shoal Games management believes that the development of a platform system such as Rooplay will create a significant and sustainable revenue stream for the Company.
  In addition to developing and maintaining the Rooplay system, Shoal Games develops original content that it publishes into the App Stores as single apps and onto Rooplay to expand the library of content on the platform.  Mobile users can choose to download and play Shoal Games single apps, or access the entire library of hundreds of games from within Rooplay.
  Marketing & Distribution Strategy
  Shoal Games pursues both a business-to-consumer strategy and a business-to-business strategy with Rooplay.  With the Company's direct to consumer strategy, new users of Rooplay are created via paid performance marketing, search engine marketing, word-of-mouth, and from links and promotions in the Company's other mobile products.
  The business-to-business distribution strategy involves targeted business development efforts with mobile handset manufacturers, cable companies, and mobile telecommunications operators to 
  Page 5
  encourage them to partner with Shoal Games to distribute Rooplay to their customers.  Shoal Games offers revenue share opportunities to potential partners who are interested in providing content systems such as Rooplay to their customers.
 Pricing Strategy
  Shoal Games is pursuing an aggressive penetration pricing strategy with Rooplay by offering monthly subscriptions to its library of hundreds of games and its exclusive Rooplay Originals (branded Games developed by the Company) .  All users acquired via the direct-to-consumer model will be offered a free trial period before the subscription fee becomes payable.  Rooplay users acquired via partner relationships will have varying periods of free trial and pricing as determined by the partner's circumstances and region.
 Growth Strategy
  Shoal Games management is pursuing an aggressive growth strategy by approaching local partners in many regions of the world who are interested in distributing Rooplay.  Rooplay's games are not restricted to any particular region and the Company believes the demand for early learning systems such as Rooplay is strong.  
  With more than 6.8 billion mobile phone subscriptions in place globally the demand for mobile content systems is enormous.  Rooplay fills a particular need for families and with every additional piece of content that is added to the system the draw to Rooplay in comparison to other systems becomes stronger.  With the competition fierce between network operators for new mobile subscribers, Shoal Games management believes that owning a content platform system such as Rooplay will create long-term value for the Company's shareholders.    International Strategy
  The first release of Rooplay is in English, but the system has been designed from conception to provide value to children and families of every language.  Most games are developed without the requirement of any text to learn and play so Rooplay's potential for localization and international publishing is ideal.  Furthermore, all of Shoal Games' original productions for Rooplay ("Rooplay Originals") are built to support learning in any language.  
  With densely populated regions such as China interested in games, the English language, and early learning technology such as Rooplay, Shoal Games management is actively pursuing local partners to assist in the distribution of Rooplay in China.
  Trophy Bingo & Garfield's Bingo
  The Company has completed the social bingo games Trophy Bingo and Garfield's Bingo which are available on Apple's iOS, Google's Android and Amazon Android systems.  Revenue is generated in the games via in-app purchases and advertising.  Shoal Games management continues to support Trophy Bingo and Garfield's bingo to grow revenues and provide cash to the Company. 
 OPERATIONS 
   Employees 
  As of December 31, 2017, we had eleven full-time employees, not including temporary personnel, consultants, and independent contractors. Since 2006 it has been, and continues to be, the Company's objective to control its costs by retaining consultants, as needed, to provide special expertise in developing internal strategic, marketing, accounting and technical services. The Company ceased outsourcing its software development personnel in September 2016 following the bankruptcy of its outsource supplier.  The Company immediately hired the key personnel from that organization whom are now our full-time employees. None of our employees or consultants are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relationship with our employees and consultants is good.
  We are substantially dependent upon the continued services and performance of J. M. Williams, Chief Executive Officer and T. M. Williams, Executive Chairman. The loss of the services of these key 
  Page 6
  individuals would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not carry any key man life insurance on any individuals.
 Seasonality
  We do not believe that seasonality has an effect on our product demand or our revenue realization.
   Competition
   Rooplay competes with systems such as ABCMouse, Homer, Lingokids, and other learning products that are based on subscription.  Rooplay differs in that it is not only an educational system, but an entertainment system with hundreds of games both for fun and learning.  Most of the competition relies on videos and e-books for content, whereas Rooplay is only games.  ABCMouse raised US$150 million at a valuation of more than US$1Billion.  The Company views the success of ABCMouse as proof of the size of the market and is developing Rooplay to be a superior and differentiated product. 
   In the mobile bingo market, large operators have acquired the companies behind the two leading social bingo games.  Caesars Interactive Entertainment acquired Buffalo Studios, the makers of Bingo Blitz, in 2012 for $53 million.  More recently in 2014, GSN Games purchased Bash Gaming, the makers of Bingo Bash, for $160 million.  The Company views these acquisitions as confirmation that the social bingo marketplace is valuable although costly to compete with.
   Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws
  The Company is in the business of developing and marketing Rooplay, Garfield's Bingo, and Trophy Bingo. To the best of our knowledge, no federal, state or local environmental laws are applicable to our business.
 BRITISH COLUMBIA SECURITIES COMMISSION
  Effective September 15, 2008, the British Columbia Securities Commission ("BCSC") issued rule 51-509 Issuers Quoted in the U.S. Over-the-Counter Markets. Rule 51 - 509 requires all Over-the-Counter Companies that have connections to British Columbia (BC) to comply with BC securities law and certain public disclosure requirements. The Company is deemed to have connection to BC due to the fact that administration and a director are located in BC. The Company has complied with rule 51-509 and registered and filed the necessary documents on SEDAR. The Company is deemed, due to the fact that there are less than 50% of the Company's shareholders located in BC, to be a foreign reporting issuer in accordance with NI 71-102 "Continuous Disclosure and Other Exemptions Relating to Foreign Issuers". Therefore the Company is only required to file what it files with the Securities and Exchange Commission on SEDAR.
