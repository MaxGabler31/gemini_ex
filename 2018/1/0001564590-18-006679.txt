 Item 1. Business 
 Destination XL Group, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (the “Company”), is the largest specialty retailer of big & tall men’s apparel with retail locations in the United States, London, England and Toronto, Canada. We operate under the trade names of Destination XL®, DXL®, DXL Men’s Apparel, DXL outlets, Casual Male XL®, Casual Male XL outlets, Rochester Clothing, ShoesXL® and LivingXL®. We operate 212 DXL retail stores, 14 DXL outlet stores, 78 Casual Male XL retail stores, 33 Casual Male XL outlet stores and 5 Rochester Clothing stores. We also operate a direct business at DestinationXL.com, which also supports our stores, brands and product extensions. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to “we,” “our,” “ours,” “us” and “the Company” refer to Destination XL Group, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. We refer to our fiscal years ended February 3, 2018, January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016 as “fiscal 2017”, “fiscal 2016” and “fiscal 2015,” respectively. Fiscal 2017 was a 53-week year and fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 were 52-week years.
OUR INDUSTRY 
 The big & tall men’s apparel market includes pants with a waist size of 42” and greater, as well as tops sized 1XL and greater. Growth in this segment has historically been driven by rapidly changing market demographics. We believe that we can increase our market share by catering to the broader target market, attracting customers from various income, age and lifestyle segments and offering the widest selection of sizes and styles that fit well. An opportunity also exists for market share growth from the lower-size range of our market, that is, men with a 38” to 46” waist size, which we define as our “end-of-rack” customers. These sizes are usually at the high end of the size range for most men’s apparel retailers and, as a result, the selection is usually limited at such retailers.  
HISTORY 
 Our Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1976 under the name Designs, Inc. Until fiscal 1995, we operated exclusively in Levi Strauss & Co. branded apparel mall and outlet stores. In May 2002, we acquired the Casual Male business from Casual Male Corp. at a bankruptcy court-ordered auction. At the time of the acquisition, Casual Male was the largest specialty retailer of men’s clothing in the big & tall market in the United States. As a result of the acquisition, on August 8, 2002, we changed our name to “Casual Male Retail Group, Inc.” 
 Through fiscal 2010, we primarily operated Casual Male XL retail stores, Casual Male XL outlet stores and Rochester Clothing stores, along with the associated websites and catalogs. We catered to all customers through these three store formats, from our value-oriented customer (Casual Male XL outlets) to our luxury-oriented customer (Rochester Clothing stores). During that year, we tested a new store concept, Destination XL (“DXL”). The DXL store concept merged all of our existing brands under one roof, offering our customers an extensive assortment of product and an increased presence of name brands, without having to shop multiple stores. In addition to offering our customers a wide assortment, we also wanted to provide them with a unique shopping experience. We are focused on providing outstanding customer service through our DXL stores, with everything from larger fitting rooms to professional, trained associates providing both personal attention and on-site tailoring. With the initial success of this store format, we then made a

similar change to our e-commerce business in fiscal 2011 when we launched our DestinationXL.com website which, like our DXL store, merged all of our previous websites into one consolidated e-commerce site providing our customers the ability to cross-shop our brands easily. 
 As part of our new direction, in December 2012, we changed our NASDAQ stock ticker symbol to “DXLG” and in February 2013 we changed our corporate name to “Destination XL Group, Inc.” 
 BUSINESS STRATEGY 
 Over the past seven years, we have gradually transitioned the majority of our store base from our Casual Male XL retail and Rochester Clothing stores to our DXL Men’s Apparel store format.  With over 225 DXL retail and outlet stores throughout the United States and two in Canada, we have substantially completed our build-out of new DXL stores.  This represents a turning point in the evolution of our Company as the capital investment required to build out new stores becomes significantly less.  We have now reached the point where our focus heading into fiscal 2018 is on customer acquisition, customer retention and customer re-activation, through improving traffic to our stores and enhancing the customer’s experience with our direct business. We are focused on the following four key ongoing initiatives and strategies:

• | Increasing Store Productivity: Our store productivity metrics, such as dollars per transaction and conversion, have increased year-over-year, but we believe there is further opportunity to capture more customers and greater share of their wallets. One of our biggest challenges in recent years has been driving year-over-year increases in traffic to our stores. During fiscal 2018, we expect to launch a new television marketing campaign to create an emotional connection to our brand and generate a greater motivation to visit a store. We continue to invest in our store selling associates and foster a culture of XL style with every customer who walks through our door. We are also working to improve point-of–sale technology to make it easier and faster for our associates to access and sell inventory outside of the store’s four walls. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 With respect to our remaining Casual Male XL retail and outlet stores, we are currently testing a DXL remodel approach as opposed to closing the Casual Male XL store and opening a DXL store nearby.  In the second half of fiscal 2017, we converted two Casual Male XL stores to DXL stores and are tracking the results. If successful, we may continue to convert some of the remaining Casual Male XL stores over time.  The majority of our Casual Male XL stores are profitable and can continue to coexist with DXL if we choose not to pursue further remodels; however, we do expect to close certain low volume Casual Male XL retail and outlet stores as lease terms expire.  
  
• | Growing our Direct Business: Our direct business represented approximately 21.0% of our total sales in fiscal 2017 and reached 23.1% in the fourth quarter, demonstrating the potential for rapid growth in this sales channel. We are committed to providing a first-class, online experience that allows our customers to shop anytime, anywhere, on any device while providing a level of service and customization similar to what they would receive in our stores. During the latter half of fiscal 2017, we made several foundational enhancements to our website to improve the overall shopping experience. We have observed a discernable traffic migration from desktop to mobile navigation on our e-commerce site, consistent with the expected increased use of smartphones and tablets by consumers in general. Because we target a very broad and diverse customer base, we believe it is critical to segment our customer base and communicate with our customers on a personal level. We are enabling new functionality that will allow us to tailor our messaging to specific customers, based on their buying patterns. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Expanding our reach through third party marketplaces such as Amazon is also a key initiative for us to grow our direct business.  Marketplaces provide us with an opportunity to acquire new customers who are not familiar with our brand.  We have been selling on Amazon marketplace for several years and have just recently begun to participate in Amazon’s seller-fulfilled Prime program.
  
• | Focusing on the Customer: We are constantly striving to do a better job of acquiring, retaining and reactivating XL customers. Our primary tool for customer acquisition is our annual marketing campaign. For 2018, we expect to run two flights: 6 weeks in the Spring and 5 weeks in the Fall. Based on testing that we have performed, we believe that the most effective marketing campaign for the target XL customer is one that sparks an emotional connection with our brand. We will continue to glean insights from previous campaigns and modify our future campaigns in an effort to connect with target customers and communicate the brand’s benefits and why our target customers should shop with us. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have a loyal customer base, with approximately 93% of our transactions processed through our loyalty program.  Our customer response rates from loyalty offers are increasing, and the loyalty program allows us to communicate to our best customers in a manner that has a more exclusive look and feel and is an important tool for retention. We saw encouraging customer response to our loyalty perks in the fourth quarter of 2017, and we hope to build off of that progress in fiscal 2018 and motivate our existing customers to visit and shop more often and spend a greater share of their wallets with us.

• | Marketing our Merchandise Assortment: Our good, better, best merchandise assortment strategy has been a cornerstone of our business. We have over 100 designer brands and a strong private label offering and we are able to customize the merchandise selection for every store. Our growth of the “end-of-rack” customer, which we define as customers with waist size 38” to 46”, is bringing in a younger, smaller-waist customer, who spends more and shops more often. We are responding to the demands of this new customer with our new “What’s on Tap” fashion-forward-product line which brings the newest fashion trends to our stores with limited lead times. In addition, where in the past lead time prevented us from replenishing in season, we are now able to react within 30 to 45 days. We are also looking at opportunities to deliver more fashion product to our smaller DXL stores that until now have been primarily assorted with core product. A key initiative of our marketing campaigns in 2018 will be messaging to our customers the quality, fit and breadth of our merchandise offerings. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OUR BUSINESS 
 We operate as an omni-channel retailer of big & tall men’s apparel.  Through our multiple brands, which include both branded apparel and private-label, we offer a broad range of merchandise at varying price points, catering from the value-oriented customer to the luxury-oriented customer. Our objective is to appeal to all of our customers by providing a good, better, best array of product assortments in all primary lifestyles with multiple and convenient ways to shop. 
 Our DXL retail stores and e-commerce site cater to all income demographics and offer our customers merchandise to fit a variety of lifestyles from casual to business, young to mature, in all price ranges and in all large sizes from XL and up. In addition, our e-commerce site includes a complete offering of shoes in sizes 10W to 18W.  Our Casual Male XL stores primarily carry moderate-priced branded and private label casual sportswear and dresswear, while our Rochester Clothing stores carry fine quality, designer and branded menswear. We also operate Casual Male XL outlets and DXL outlets for our value-oriented customer.  
 Another important part of our business operation is managing the number of sizes offered to our customers and optimizing our in-stock position throughout each season. Our best-selling pant has 49 size combinations as compared to an average retailer who may only have 15 different size combinations.  We maintain a consolidated inventory across all channels that enable us to manage our in-stock position of all sizes effectively, ultimately improving customer service. Moreover, our planning and allocation methodologies, with respect to store assortment planning, help to optimize each location’s market potential without excessive inventory levels. 
 MERCHANDISE 
 We offer our customers a broad assortment of apparel that is appropriate to our diverse customer base. Regardless of our customers’ age, socioeconomic status, or lifestyle preference, we are able to assemble a wardrobe to fit our customers’ apparel needs. We offer such assortments in private-label product, balanced with an array of brand name labels. With over 5,000 styles available, we carry tops in sizes up to 8XL and 8XLT, bottoms with waist sizes 38” to 70”, and shoes in sizes 10W to 18W. In addition, we added to our product assortment a smaller fit XL and XLT to appeal to our target “end-of-rack” customer. 
 Our stores are merchandised to showcase entire outfits by lifestyle, including traditional, active, denim, young men’s, dress wear and contemporary. This format allows us to merchandise key items and seasonal goods in prominent displays and makes coordinating outfits easier for the customer while encouraging multi-item purchases. This lifestyle layout also allows us to manage store space and product assortment more effectively in each market to target local demographics. The key item strategy is also fully integrated by lifestyle, allowing us to focus on merchandise presentation and offer our customers a compelling value proposition. 
 Merchandise assortments in our DXL stores are organized not only by lifestyle, but within each lifestyle, the assortments are shown in a “good”, “better”, “best” and “luxury” visual presentation, again to benefit our customers’ ease of shopping. With the “best” merchandise assortments featured most prominently in the DXL store, our customers are able to visualize current fashion trends and select their wardrobes within their desired price points in a convenient manner. 
 We carry several well-known national brands of merchandise (“branded apparel”) as well as a number of our own private-label lines within our “good”, “better”, “best” and “luxury” price points.  The penetration of branded apparel in our DXL stores can range from 15% to 80%, depending on several factors, but on average, our DXL stores carry approximately 50% branded merchandise.  
 Higher-End Luxury Fashion Apparel -“Best” and “Luxury” Merchandise 
 Within this higher-end price range, we carry a broad selection of quality apparel from well-known branded manufacturers such as, Brooks Brothers®,  The North Face®, Gran Sasso®, John Laing®, Remy, Psycho Bunny®, Derek Rose, Brioni®, Coppley, Eton®, Hickey Freeman®, Jack Victor®, Lucky, Michael Kors®, Pantherella®, Paul & Shark, JOE’S® Jeans, Robert Graham®, Robert Talbot, St. Hillaire, Ted Baker®, True Religion®, Turnbull & Asser®, Robert Barakett®, MVP®, and David Donahue®.

Moderate-Priced Apparel -“Better” Merchandise 
 We offer our customer an extensive selection of quality sportswear and dress clothing at moderate prices carrying such well-known brands such as: Buffalo Jeans®, Rainforest, Brooks Brothers®, O’Neill®, Retro Brand, Cutter & Buck®, Levis®, Adidas® Golf, Columbia, Berne®, Carhartt®, Callaway®, CK Jeans®, CK Sport®,  Jockey®, Lacoste®, Majestic, Polo Ralph Lauren®, Tommy Bahama®, Tommy Hilfiger®, and Tallia®. 
 In addition, we carry several moderate-priced private-label lines:

Value-Priced Apparel -“Good” Merchandise 
 For our value-oriented customers, we carry Geoffrey Beene®, Cubavera, Nautica® and Nautica Jeans®, Dockers, Lee, Perry Ellis, Wrangler, Reebok and PX Clothing. In addition we carry several value-priced private label lines: 
  
• | Harbor Bay® was our first proprietary brand and it is a traditional line that continues to represent a significant portion of our business, specifically in terms of our core basic merchandise.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gold Series™ is our core performance offering of tailored-related separates, blazers, dress slacks, dress shirts and neckwear that blends comfort features such as stretch, stain resistance and wrinkle-free fabrics with basic wardrobe essentials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Synrgy™ targets the customer looking for a contemporary/modern look.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

RETAIL CHANNEL 
 Destination XL Stores (“DXL”) 
 Our DXL store concept brings all of our brands together in one format. Within this format, we cater to our diverse customer base, with merchandise representing all price points, from our luxury brands to value-oriented brands, and all lifestyles, from business to denim.  The size of our current DXL stores, which contain almost triple the product assortments of a Casual Male XL store, averages 7,800 square feet.  Since fiscal 2014, we have been opening smaller (5,000-6,500 square feet) DXL stores.  Because the size of these stores is smaller, they carry a smaller product offering than our other DXL stores but are representative of the “good, better, best” merchandise variety. We seek to locate our DXL stores in places that are highly visible, preferably adjacent to regional malls or other high-traffic shopping areas.
 Our DXL stores provide our customers a spacious store with up to three times the product offering of a Casual Male XL store. The merchandise in our DXL stores is organized by lifestyle: active, traditional, modern and denim with a representation of all of our brands and price points, utilizing a “good, better, best” pricing structure. Depending on the customers in each respective market, we can adjust the appropriate mix of merchandise, with varying selections from each of our price points, to cater to each demographic market. This larger store format also provides us the footprint necessary to carry a complete offering of dress wear, including tailored and “made-to-measure” custom clothing, as well as a selection of shoes in extended sizes and a broad assortment of accessories such as belts, ties, and socks. 
 During fiscal 2017, we opened 20 DXL retail stores and 1 DXL outlet store, bringing our store count at February 3, 2018 to 212 DXL retail stores and 14 DXL outlet stores. This includes two DXL retail stores which opened in Toronto, Canada during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  For fiscal 2018, we plan to open two DXL retail stores and one DXL outlet store, and to remodel two Casual Male XL retail stores to DXL retail stores.

Casual Male XL Retail Stores 
 At February 3, 2018, we operated 78 Casual Male XL full-price retail stores, located primarily in strip centers or stand-alone locations. The majority of the merchandise carried in our Casual Male XL stores is moderate-priced basic or fashion-neutral items, such as jeans, casual slacks, t-shirts, polo shirts, dress shirts and suit separates. These stores also carry a full complement of our “better” private label collections. The average Casual Male XL retail store is approximately 3,400 square feet. 
DXL Outlet /Casual Male XL Outlet Stores
 At February 3, 2018, we operated 33 Casual Male XL and 14 DXL outlet stores designed to offer a wide range of casual clothing for the big & tall customer at prices that are generally 20-25% lower than our moderate-priced merchandise. Much of the merchandise in our outlet stores is offered with the purchasing interests of the value-oriented customer in mind. In addition to private-label and branded merchandise at our “good” price tier, our outlets also carry clearance product obtained from DXL, Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing stores, offering the outlet customer the ability to purchase branded and fashion product for a reduced price. 
 The average Casual Male XL outlet store is approximately 3,100 square feet and the average DXL outlet is approximately 5,100 square feet.   
 Rochester Clothing Stores 
 At February 3, 2018, we operated 5 Rochester Clothing stores, located in major cities in the United States and one store in London, England. The Rochester Clothing stores have a wide selection of our “best” merchandise which consists primarily of high-end merchandise from well-recognized brands. In addition, these stores also carry a few private-label lines that are specifically designed for our high-end customer. The average Rochester Clothing store is approximately 10,000 square feet. 
International
 In addition to our Rochester Clothing store located in London, England, we also have one franchised DXL store in the Middle East at the Symphony Mall in Kuwait City, Kuwait, which was opened in fiscal 2014 pursuant to a franchise agreement with The Standard Arabian Business & Enterprises Company (SABECO).  
 In the spring of fiscal 2017, we opened two DXL stores in Toronto, Canada. These are the first DXL brand stores operated by the Company outside of the United States. We believe that Canada provides a strategic growth opportunity for our DXL brand. We believe that the international big & tall men’s apparel market is currently underserved and we will continue to consider and evaluate opportunities for international growth in the future.  
DIRECT CHANNEL 
 Our direct business, which consists primarily of our e-commerce business, is a vital part of our growing omni-channel business approach, allowing us to service our customers whether it is in-person at a store, over the telephone, or online via a computer, smartphone or tablet. Our direct business enables the omni-channel approach by encouraging and expecting our store associates to use our e-commerce sites to help fulfill our customers’ clothing needs. If a wider selection of a lifestyle, color or size of an item is not available in our store, then our store associates can order the item for our customer through our direct channel and have it shipped to the store or directly to the customer. Our customers also have the ability to order online and pick-up in store on the same day.
 With the ability to showcase all of our store inventories online, we are seeing an increase in the number of transactions that are initiated online but are ultimately completed in store.  In addition, our stores are able to fulfill an order for an item that is out-of-stock in our warehouse.  This capability has not only resulted in incremental sales, but it has also helped us reduce clearance merchandise at the store level and manage margins. 
 Destination XL® E-Commerce Site 
 In fiscal 2013, we combined all of our then-existing web addresses and redirected our customers to the Destination XL website, keeping the individual landing pages for the respective sites.  As part of our initiative to streamline and simplify the shopping experience for our customers, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 we launched a redesign of our website, which included folding the individual landing pages into a single www.destinationxl.com landing page. Our redesigned website offers our customers a unique online experience, incorporating the visual merchandising and customer service expertise from our brick and mortar stores. Similar to our DXL store concept, our www.destinationxl.com website allows our customers to conveniently shop across all of our brands and product extensions.

Customers can search across all of our brands and, similar to our stores, shop merchandise from value-oriented to luxury price points.  In addition, a customer can tailor their search using our “size profile.”  Our Destination XL website also offers a complete line of men’s footwear in extended sizes, offering our customers a full range of footwear in hard-to-find sizes.  Although our DXL stores all have a selection of footwear available, we are able to offer a full assortment of sizes and styles through our website.  The assortment is a reflection of our apparel, with a broad selection from moderate to luxury and from casual to formal. We currently have a selection of more than 600 styles of shoes, ranging in sizes from 10W to 18W. We carry a number of designer brands including Cole Haan®, Allen Edmonds®, Timberland®, Calvin Klein®, Lacoste®, Donald J. Pliner and Bruno Magli®. 
 With more of our customers moving away from desktop toward their mobile devices, we have taken a “mobile-first” mindset on designing customer interactions as we continue to innovate and enhance the customer’s shopping experience. Our mobile optimized website, m.destinationxl.com,  and our recently launched mobile app help our customers browse products, checkout, access our loyalty program information, research inventory in a local store, and find a local store location.  
 We believe that our customers’ interactions with us, on a digital level, are key to customer retention and future growth.  We are elevating our customer relation management (“CRM”) system to create a platform where we have a 360-view of our customer beyond just a history of past purchases and preferences.  Infusing third-party data and predictive shopping habits, we will have the ability to engage with our customers in a more personalized level.
 In addition to our Destination XL website, our customers can also access our LivingXL website directly from our homepage.  LivingXL is an online-only store that specializes in the selling of select high-quality products which help larger people maintain a more comfortable lifestyle. The types of products sold on our website benefit both men and women and include chairs, outdoor accessories, travel accessories, bed and bath and fitness equipment. 
 For our international customers, upon entering our full site, these visitors are identified based on where they reside globally and are able to shop in their local currency. In addition, checkout is customized based on their location, with local payment methods and a guaranteed cost including shipping and taxes. 
 Online Marketplaces
 Broadening our reach through online marketplaces continues to be a growth initiative for our direct business.  During fiscal 2017, we elevated our positioning with Amazon and now have a large portion of our assortment available with Amazon Prime shipping.  Online marketplaces, such as Amazon, Walmart.com and Jet.com, provide us an opportunity to grow our customer base and introduce them to our brand. 
MERCHANDISE PLANNING AND ALLOCATION  
 Our merchandise planning and allocation function is critical to the effective management of our inventory, store assortments, product sizes and overall gross margin profitability. The merchandise planning and allocation team has an array of planning and replenishment tools available to assist in maintaining an appropriate level of inventory, in-stock positions at the store and for the direct channel, and pre-season planning for product assortments for each store and the direct channel. Additionally, in-season reporting identifies opportunities and challenges in inventory performance. Over the past several years, we have made and will continue to make investments in implementing best practice tools and processes for our merchandise planning and allocation. 
 Our core merchandise makes up approximately 38% of our merchandise assortment. Our planning and allocation team estimates quantity and demand several months in advance to optimize gross margin and minimize end-of-season merchandise for all seasonal merchandise. We develop customized assortment strategies by store that accentuate lifestyle preferences for each particular store. 
 Our merchandising data warehouse provides the merchandising team with standardized reporting for monitoring assortment performance by product category and by store, identifying in-stock positions by size and generally monitoring overall inventory levels relative to selling. At season end, we analyze the overall performance of product categories, overall assortments and specific styles by store to focus on the opportunities and challenges for the next season’s planning cycle. 
 Utilizing a set of specific universal reporting tools, we are able to fulfill the daily, weekly and monthly roles and responsibilities of the merchandise planning and allocation team. These reporting tools provide focused and actionable views of the business to optimize the overall assortment by category and by store. We believe that by having all members of the merchandise planning and allocation team follow a standardized set of processes with the use of standardized reporting tools, our inventory performance will be optimized.

STORE OPERATIONS
We believe that our store associates are the key to creating the highest quality experience for our customers. Beginning with the advent of our initial testing of DXL stores, we committed to change the culture in our stores from an operationally-driven organization to a sales-driven, customer-centric organization. Our overall goal was to assist our associates in becoming less task-oriented and more focused on serving the customer. We want our associates to help our customer meet his apparel needs through building his wardrobe; not just selling our customer a single item. In order to accomplish this, we invested in educating our associates.  Our associates are trained to be clothing experts, capable of accommodating our customer’s style and fit needs with ready-to-wear clothing. Our associates’ ability to be well versed in not only the product selection carried in their store, but also globally, coupled with access to order items for the customer via the web in-store, allows our associates to fulfill all of their customers’ needs. Our stores also offer on-site tailoring in order to assist customers in receiving a perfect fit. In addition to product knowledge, our training approach includes behavioral training as well.  A key component to the success of this program is finding the right caliber of store associates. Our multi-unit, field management team receives extensive training on recruiting associates who are the correct fit for our stores. Our new DXL store management team hires are enrolled in “The DXL Experience Training Program,” with time spent in one of our two Regional Training Centers. The culture has been created over the last eight years to promote from our internal associates, starting at the Assistant Store Manager level up to, and including, the Vice President of Operations level. Our Regional Vice-Presidents give us touch-points in the field in addition to the Regional Sales Managers and the store management to ensure consistency in executing our standards and all programs and processes we deem important to our success.
 Each new store management team member spends time in a DXL store, working with certified training managers to solidify their training before they are released to their “home” store.  This allows each new store management team member to apply the skills learned during “The DXL Experience Training Program” so they in turn will have the tools to manage their respective stores successfully. We are able to gauge the effectiveness of our training through measuring sales productivity at each level of the field organization, including individual sales associates. We believe these educational programs, together with monitoring sales metrics to help identify opportunities for further training, will improve sales productivity and strengthen our customer’s brand loyalty. 
 Each DXL, Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing store is staffed with a store manager, assistant managers and associates. The store manager is responsible for achieving certain sales and operational targets. Our stores have an incentive-based commission plan for managers and selling staff to encourage associates to focus on our customer’s wardrobing needs and sales productivity.  Our field organization strives to promote from within - a culture that has been building for eight years, with approximately 90% of the field organization’s multi-unit managers having managed one of our retail stores. 
 Our field organization is overseen by our Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer, Senior Vice President of Store Sales and Operations, Regional Vice Presidents and Regional Sales Managers, who provide management development and guidance to individual store managers. Each Regional Sales Manager is responsible for hiring and developing store managers at the stores assigned to that Regional Sales Manager’s market, and for the overall operations and profitability of those stores. 
 MARKETING AND ADVERTISING 
 
We believe marketing and advertising are key drivers in increasing brand awareness which, in turn, increases traffic to our stores and online. Our marketing focus is on increasing the awareness of our DXL brand, so shoppers will think of us when they decide to purchase men’s XL clothing or accessories. With only 4 out of every 10 men aware of who we are, we believe we have a great opportunity to build our customer base and increase market share.  In fiscal 2016, we experienced a drop in our brand recognition, which was the result of decreased spending on national media. In fiscal 2017, we aired TV and Radio for 14 weeks, compared to only 6 weeks in fiscal 2016, which had a measurable impact brand awareness and customer count as we saw our brand awareness increase from 34% at the end of fiscal 2016 to 42% at the end of fiscal 2017. 
 In fiscal 2017, we increased our marketing expenses to $29.5 million, with an emphasis on new creative and additional digital advertising.  In fiscal 2018, we expect marketing expenses to be $24.0 million.  Our 2018 marketing program will include two media campaigns: first, our Spring campaign, which will run up to Father’s Day; second, our Fall/Holiday campaign, which will run for 6 weeks. We are also launching new creative advertising for 2018, which will emphasize fit, expertise, brands, in-store experience, and one-stop shopping. The new campaign will highlight DXL’s key differentiators and will seek to spark an emotional connection with our core consumer. In addition to adding back television to aid in growing the customer count, we plan to focus more aggressively on our customer loyalty program. Our loyalty program has consistently delivered better response rates as compared to our other direct marketing programs. Approximately 93% of customers in our active customer base are enrolled in our loyalty program, resulting in a more than 59% DXL customer corporate retention rate. On a rolling twelve-month basis, our DXL retail stores have an almost 35% higher customer retention rate than our Casual Male XL retail stores.  In addition, we will focus on personalization in our email marketing and digital programs, which we believe will make our reduced marketing spend in 2018 more cost effective. We will also be implementing a new CRM system to support our direct marketing efforts.

As we close more of our Casual Male XL stores in fiscal 2018, we will continue our efforts to increase awareness of the DXL brand and convert Casual Male XL customers to our DXL stores. We have converted more than 51% of our Casual Male XL customers since we began our transition over to DXL. Our focus will continue to be on transitioning our best Casual Male XL customers first, followed by other active, high-sales-contributing tiers of customers.  
 GLOBAL SOURCING 
 We have strong experience in sourcing internationally, particularly in Asia, where we manufacture a significant percentage of our private-label merchandise. We have established relationships with some of the leading factories. Our sourcing network consists of over 21 factories in 4 countries. Currently, approximately 50% of all our product needs are sourced directly. 
 Our global sourcing strategy is a balanced approach considering quality, cost and lead time, depending on the requirements of the program. We believe our current sourcing structure is sufficient to meet our operating requirements and provide capacity for growth. The growth and effectiveness of our global direct sourcing program is a key component to the strength of merchandise margins. 
 In an effort to minimize foreign currency risk, all payments to our direct sourced vendors and buying agents are made in U.S. dollars through the use of letters of credit or payment on account. 
 DISTRIBUTION 
 All of our distribution operations are centralized at our headquarters located in Canton, Massachusetts. However, if merchandise is available at the store level but not available at the distribution center, our stores are capable of completing the order and shipping it directly to a customer. 
 We believe that having one centralized distribution facility minimizes the delivered cost of merchandise and maximizes the in-stock position of our stores. We believe that the centralized distribution system enables our stores to maximize selling space by reducing necessary levels of back-room stock carried in each store. In addition, the distribution center provides order fulfillment services for our e-commerce business. 
 Since 2003, we have utilized United Parcel Services (“UPS”) for all of our store shipments as well as our domestic customer deliveries. By utilizing UPS, we are able to track all deliveries from the warehouse to our individual stores, including the status of in-transit shipments. In addition, we are able to provide our direct customers with Authorized Return Service and Web labels, making returns more convenient for them.  Our current contract with UPS is through January 5, 2020.  
 In order to service our International customers, we have contracted with a global e-commerce company for payment and shipment services.  Through this service, international customers view and pay for products in their local currency.  Our vendor then ships directly to our customer, which we believe helps avoid potential fraud and currency exchange rate risks.
 Our warehousing application for our distribution center systems streamlines our distribution processes, enhances our in-transit times, and reduces our distribution costs substantially. Over the past several years, we have made improvements to our software such as automated packing for single piece orders, barcode scanning technologies and scanning technologies for our sortation systems, in order to improve productivity and to lower packing costs. 
 Our supply chain technology provides visibility for imports and domestic deliveries giving our buyers accurate shipping information and allowing the distribution center to plan staffing for arriving freight, resulting in reduced costs and improved receipt efficiency. 
 In-bound calls for our direct business are currently handled at our Canton facility and are primarily fulfilled by our distribution center.  If an order cannot be fulfilled by our distribution center, the order is completed at the store level.  
 MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
 The infrastructure of our management information systems is a priority to us. We believe that the investments we have made in this regard have improved our overall efficiency and most importantly have enabled us to manage our inventory more effectively. 
 Our management information systems consist of a full range of retail merchandising and financial systems which include merchandise planning and reporting, distribution center processing, inventory allocation, sales reporting, and financial processing and reporting. We believe that our current infrastructure provides us the ability and capacity to process transactions more efficiently and provides our management team with comprehensive tools with which to manage our business.

Using a retail business intelligence solution, we are able to integrate data from several sources and provide enterprise-wide analytics reporting. Over the past few years, we have developed a custom Assortment Suite application that leverages business intelligence and predictive analytics to provide high impact insights into core merchandising tasks. In an effort to further improve our inventory management, we have created a standardized set of “best practices” for both our merchandise planning and allocation groups. 
 Our direct business and retail business maintain a shared inventory system and we operate a single system platform for DXL, Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing to deliver improved efficiencies and to make our full product assortment available to all of our business formats. 
 In fiscal 2018, we plan to upgrade our order management systems, which will upgrade our warehouse management and logistics capabilities for enhanced inventory visibility and order fulfillment. We continually work to improve our web environment. Our mobile optimized site capitalizes on the growing use of mobile devices to look up store information, review product offerings, and complete purchases. We have a tablet optimized website to further capitalize on the continued growth of mobile e-commerce, and in fiscal 2017 we launched our mobile app.  In addition, our current website is fully integrated with a global e-commerce company to accommodate international customers by providing multi-currency pricing, payment processing, and international shipping. Functionality was also implemented to support an online custom shirt program and an in-store application to support both a custom suit and custom shirt program. 
 COMPETITION 
 Our business faces competition from a variety of sources, including department stores such as Macy’s and Dillard’s, mass merchandisers, other specialty stores and discount and off-price retailers, as well as other retailers that sell big & tall men’s apparel. While we have successfully competed on the basis of merchandise selection, comfort and fit, customer service and desirable store locations, there can be no assurances that other retailers, including e-commerce retailers, will not adopt purchasing and marketing concepts similar to ours. Discount retailers with significant buying power, such as Wal-Mart and J.C. Penney, represent a source of competition for us. The direct business has several competitors, including the King Size catalog and website as well as online marketplaces, such as Amazon. 
 The United States big & tall men’s apparel market is highly competitive with many national and regional department stores, specialty apparel retailers, single market operators and discount stores offering a broad range of apparel products similar to ours. Besides retail competitors, we consider any casual apparel manufacturer operating in outlet malls throughout the United States to be a competitor in the casual apparel market. We believe that we are the only national operator of apparel stores focused on the men’s big & tall market. 
 SEASONALITY 
 Historically, and consistent with the retail industry, we have experienced seasonal fluctuations as it relates to our operating income and net income. Traditionally, a significant portion of our operating income and net income is generated in the fourth quarter, as a result of the holiday season.
