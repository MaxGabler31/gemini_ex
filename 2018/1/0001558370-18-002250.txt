 ITEM 1.              BUSINESS
 We are a leading provider of total water management and chemical solutions to the unconventional oil and gas industry in the United States and Western Canada. We were formed as a Delaware corporation in November 2016. Within the major shale plays in the United States, we believe we are a market leader in sourcing, transfer (both by permanent pipeline and temporary hose) and temporary containment of water prior to its use in drilling and completion activities associated with hydraulic fracture stimulation or “fracking,” which we collectively refer to as “pre‑frac water services”. In addition, we provide testing and flowback services immediately following the well completion. In most of our areas of operations, we also provide additional complementary water‑related services that support oil and gas well completion and production activities, including monitoring, treatment, hauling, water recycling and disposal. We also manufacture a full suite of specialty chemicals used in well completions, and we provide chemicals needed by our customers to help increase oil and gas production and lower costs over the extended life of a typical well. We have historically generated a substantial majority of our revenues through providing total water solutions to our customers, and we believe we are the only company that provides total water solutions together with complementary chemical products and related expertise, which we believe gives us a unique competitive advantage in our industry.
 Water is essential to the development and completion of unconventional oil and gas wells, where producers rely on fracking to stimulate the production of oil and gas from dense subsurface rock formations. The volume of water required to economically produce tight oil and gas reserves in the United States and Canada has grown more than tenfold over the past five years. Water and related services comprise a large and growing portion of our customers’ drilling and completion costs. In support of new well development, we source, transfer, provide containment of and treat the water used by our customers in the well completion process. The fracking process involves the injection of large volumes of water and proppant (typically sand) together with chemicals under high pressure, through a cased and cemented wellbore into targeted subsurface formations thousands of feet below ground to fracture the surrounding rock. Our completion chemicals are blended with water to improve the transport and placement of proppant in targeted zones within the producing formation. The induced fractures near the wellbore allow hydrocarbons to flow into the wellbore for extraction. Our team of chemists and research and development personnel work with our customers to optimize the frac fluid system. Up to fifty percent of the water pumped into the well during the fracking process returns as “flowback” during the first several weeks following the well completion process, and a large percentage of the remainder, plus pre‑existing water in the formation, is recovered as produced water over the life of the well. This flowback and produced water must be captured, contained and either disposed of in an environmentally safe manner, or treated and recycled for reuse in subsequent frack jobs. We provide services that support the operator’s management of flowback and produced water. After the fracking process is completed, we provide a variety of services related to the initial phase of the flowback and production operations that complement the longer‑term oil and gas production activities, including designing and executing chemical treatment programs to improve well productivity, extend the useful life of wells and reduce production costs.

 The diagram below illustrates the primary water solutions and oilfield chemicals services we provide during the completion and production cycle of a horizontal well:

 As the development of unconventional reservoirs has evolved over the past decade, the total volumes of water required in the fracking process have grown dramatically. Management estimates that the completion of a horizontal well in 2009 required an average of approximately 75,000 barrels of water or approximately 575 tank truck loads. Today, current horizontal well completions can require in excess of 500,000 barrels per well or roughly 3,850 tank truck loads. Multi‑well pad completions can require in excess of 5 million barrels of water per pad, or the equivalent of 38,500 tank truck loads. Significant mechanical, logistical, environmental and safety issues related to the transfer and subsequent containment of such large volumes via tank truck have resulted in tank trucks no longer representing a viable solution for the transport of frack water. Accordingly, E&P companies have shifted their pre-frac operational focus away from traditional tank truck operators and small, local water service providers, to larger, regional and national players, like us, who have the expertise, technology and scale to provide high quality, reliable, comprehensive and environmentally sound water services.
 The total volumes of flowback and produced water are even greater―by some estimates, the U.S. oil and gas industry today produces over 20 billion barrels of water per year and this volume is likely to grow. We believe the industry will increasingly turn to companies like us to help cost effectively manage produced water in an environmentally responsible way.
 We believe our broad geographic footprint, comprehensive suite of water services, inventory of water sources and permanent and temporary pipeline infrastructure position us to be a leading provider of water solutions in all of the shale plays that we serve. We have well‑established field operations in what we believe to be core areas of many of the most active shale plays in the United States and Canada, including the Permian Basin, SCOOP/STACK, Bakken, Eagle Ford, Haynesville, Marcellus, Utica, Rockies (DJ/Niobrara, Powder River and Uinta), other Mid‑Continent (“MidCon”) basins (Woodford, Barnett, Fayetteville, Granite Wash and Mississippian) and Western Canada. Our broad footprint enables us to service the majority of current domestic unconventional drilling and completions activity. We estimate that over 80% of all currently active U.S. onshore horizontal rigs are operating in our primary service areas and anticipate that the vast majority of rigs that will be deployed in the near‑ to medium‑term will be situated in these areas. In particular, we have established a strong position in the Permian Basin, which is presently our largest operating region,

and where producers are continuing to invest significant capital as commodity prices continue to recover from recent lows.
 We seek to be a comprehensive provider of total water management and chemical solutions for our customers in most of our areas of operations. We have the capability to provide all of the pre-frac water services and many of the complementary chemicals our customers require in their drilling and completion activities, including the sourcing, transferring, containing, treatment, testing and monitoring of water. We also offer various complementary water‑related services that support oil and gas completion and production activities, including well testing, flowback, post-frac fluid hauling, pipeline gathering, treatment, recycling and disposal of water. In addition, we develop and manufacture a full suite of production chemicals used to enhance performance over the life of a well.
 On the pre-frac side our Water Solutions segment’s inventory of water sources is a key competitive advantage that enables us to offer our customers reliable access to the volume of water essential for fracking operations. Water sources are often difficult to locate, acquire and permit, particularly in the quantities needed for multi‑well pad development programs. We have spent years obtaining strategic water sources and have secured permits or long‑term access rights to approximately 1.5 billion barrels of water annually from hundreds of sources, including large scale sources such as the Brazos, Missouri, Navasota, Ohio, Rio Grande, Sabine, San Antonio and Washita Rivers. In the Bakken, for example, we believe we have established a market leading position by securing three governmental permits which enable us to withdraw up to 100 million barrels of water annually from the Missouri River and Lake Sakakawea in North Dakota. Fresh water access cannot be easily replicated on Lake Sakakawea today as there are multiple environmental and regulatory conditions that must be met before an industrial water intake location can be built. New permits will also not be granted within 25 miles of an intake location associated with an existing permit. We have three of the five existing permits off Lake Sakakawea. In addition to surface water rights, groundwater resources are a key component of our extensive water portfolio. These sources have been secured or developed within our Water Solutions group and are designed with dedicated containment and transfer logistics to offer a complete water management solution. The first step in procuring a water source is identifying an area of interest based on anticipated drilling and completion activity as a result of lease activity, applications for permits and industry sources. After a specific water source is identified, we perform an assessment of the particular prospective source, including confirming availability, regulatory status, and any limitations on potential water rights. We use our AquaView® technology to quantify volumes and flow rates to verify current and potential water availability and volumes. After confirming the relevant ownership information, we begin negotiations with the applicable landowner or holder of the water rights. After finalizing the agreements and access rights, our team will obtain necessary regulatory approvals, permits and rights‑of‑way as needed based on the regulatory authorities involved and individual circumstances. Going forward, we believe that our expertise and relationships in water sourcing will provide us with a competitive advantage in identifying and securing additional sources of water. Additionally, water is increasingly becoming sourced through the reuse of produced or flowback water from existing wells that has been subjected to various treatment or fresh water blending options. We have a dedicated team of individuals focused on developing water treatment and reuse services to our customers and although water reuse has been a relatively small percentage of our revenue to‑date, we believe demands for our water reuse services will increase as water demands increase, regulatory restrictions increase, disposal options decrease, water treatment costs decline and operators reevaluate the reuse of treated flowback and produced water in their completion programs.
 We also manage the transfer of water from the source, between containments and ultimately to the wellsite for well completion. We have invested significant capital in temporary pipe, including approximately 1,400 miles of lay‑flat hose, and other related assets. Our lay‑flat hose provides a flexible water transfer solution and can be customized to fit a specific project. After the completion of a project, lay‑flat hose can be quickly and cost‑effectively removed and redeployed for a new project. These investments enable us to provide our customers with temporary water transfer systems that have substantially lower risk of leaks or spills compared to many alternative temporary piping options. We believe our expansive inventory of lay‑flat hose, in combination with our customers’ preference for this temporary water transfer method, positions us to be a market leader for this class of water transfer services. To support our water sourcing and transfer services, we have also made significant investments in strategic permanent pipelines that provide reliable and cost effective water delivery. Our most significant pipeline assets are located in the Bakken and allow us to take advantage of our water permits in that region. Our Bakken pipelines consist of two active underground pipeline systems, the Charlson and the Iverson systems, in McKenzie County, North Dakota that can currently deliver up to 62 million barrels of fresh water per year. We are in the process of developing a third underground pipeline to support Williams 

 
  6

 
County and western Mountrail County in North Dakota that would allow us to fully utilize our annual water rights in this region. We have signed long‑term contracts supported by Areas of Mutual Interest with major Bakken producers that we believe will use a significant portion of our current pipeline capacity. We have also made investments outside of the Bakken, including our pipeline serving the SCOOP area of Oklahoma, the “Pecan Hill Pipeline,” and our pipeline serving the Haynesville, the “IP Pipeline.” Additionally, with the GRR Acquisition (as defined below) we acquired rights to a vast array of fresh, brackish and effluent water sources with access to significant volumes of water annually and water transport infrastructure, including over 1,200 miles of temporary and permanent pipeline infrastructure and related storage facilities and pumps, all located in the northern Delaware Basin portion of the Permian Basin.
 In addition to water sourcing and transfer, our Water Solutions segment offers various complementary water‑related services that support oil and gas completion and production activities. Before and during the completion phase of a well, along with water sourcing and transfer, we offer water containment, monitoring and treatment solutions. Following the completion process, we provide flowback and well testing services, flowback and produced water hauling, pipeline gathering and disposal services and water treatment and recycling solutions relating to the potential reuse of flowback and produced water for new well completions. We support our customers across the life cycle of a well from completion to production and our comprehensive technical expertise related to water solutions management uniquely positions us relative to other water solutions providers to provide our customers comprehensive service solutions designed to maximize well performance, reduce costs and increase efficiencies while reducing the environmental impacts of their resource development.
 Our Oilfield Chemicals segment develops, manufactures and provides a full suite of chemicals utilized in hydraulic fracturing, stimulation, cementing and well completions, including polymers that create viscosity, crosslinkers, friction reducers, surfactants, buffers, breakers and other chemical technologies, to leading pressure pumping service companies in the United States. Our production chemicals solutions, which can be applied to producing wells throughout their producing lives, are applied to underperforming wells in order to enhance well performance and reduce production costs through the use of production treating chemicals, corrosion and scale monitoring, chemical inventory management, well failure analysis and lab services. Our product lines support the full range of fluid systems utilized primarily in the completion and development of unconventional resources. The use of automated communications systems combined with direct‑to‑wellsite delivery ensures seamless product availability for our customers, while our chemical expertise enables us to deliver a customized suite of products to meet customers’ technical and economical product needs. Our expertise in frac chemistry also positions us to support our customers in developing programs to reuse produced and flowback water as an alternative to disposal. In addition to our product offering, we provide inventory management services, including procurement, warehousing and delivery services. We have two primary manufacturing facilities in Texas, five regional distribution centers and 29 heavy chemical transport trucks and provide products to our customers in all major U.S. shale basins. Rockwater will also have the first in-basin manufacturing facility of emulsion polymers (friction reducers) in our industry. The in-basin manufacturing facility is strategically located in the Permian Basin which will provide a strategic advantage of being able to reduce our overall costs of raw materials that can now be delivered directly to the basin by rail.  
 We also offer our customers various ancillary services through our Wellsite Services segment. Through our subsidiary, Peak Oilfield Services, LLC (“Peak”), we provide workforce accommodations and surface rental equipment supporting oil and gas drilling, completion and production operations. Through our subsidiary, Affirm Oilfield Services, LLC (“Affirm”), we provide crane and logistics services, wellsite and pipeline construction and various field services. Operating under Rockwater LLC, we also offer sand hauling and logistics services in the Rockies and Bakken regions, as well as water transfer, containment, fluids hauling and other rental services in Western Canada. We provide our Wellsite Services to a wide range of customers in many of the most active shale plays or basins in the United States and Canada.

 We maintain a culture that prioritizes safety, the environment and our relationship with the communities in which we operate. We place a strong emphasis on the safe execution of our operations, including safety training for our employees and the development of a variety of safety programs designed to make us a market leader in safety standards. Further, our safety recognition program incentivizes employees throughout our organization to focus on conducting operations in accordance with our strict safety standards. In addition, we work closely with federal, state and local governments and community organizations to help ensure that our operations comply with legal requirements and community standards. We believe that our customers will select their service providers based in part on the quality of their safety and compliance records, and therefore, we will continue to make significant investments to be a market
 leader in this area.

 Description of Business Segments
 Following the completion of the Rockwater Merger, we offer our services through the following three operating segments: (i) Water Solutions, (ii) Oilfield Chemicals and (iii) Wellsite Services. Water Solutions
 Our Water Solutions segment is operated primarily under our subsidiary, Select LLC, and provides water‑related services to customers that include major integrated oil companies and independent oil and natural gas producers. These services include: the sourcing of water; the transfer of the water to the wellsite through permanent pipeline infrastructure and temporary hose; the containment of fluids off‑ and on‑location; measuring and monitoring of water; the filtering and treatment of fluids, well testing and handling of flowback and produced formation water; and the transportation and recycling or disposal of drilling, completion and production fluids. Service Lines
 Our Water Solutions operating segment is divided into the following service lines:
 •Water Sourcing.  Our water sourcing service line helps E&P companies source water used for drilling and completion operations from our surface, ground and industrial water sources. Specifically, through a portfolio of contracts with and permits from regulatory bodies, corporations and individual landowners, we have secured rights to approximately 1.5 billion barrels of water annually from hundreds of sources, a number which varies over time, including large scale sources such as the Brazos, Missouri, Navasota, Ohio, Rio Grande, Sabine, San Antonio and Washita Rivers. In the Bakken, we have three governmental permits that enable us to withdraw up to 100 million barrels of water annually from the Missouri River and Lake Sakakawea in North Dakota. Fresh water access cannot be easily replicated on Lake Sakakawea today as there are multiple environmental and regulatory conditions that must be met before an industrial water intake location can be built. New permits will also not be granted within 25 miles of an intake location associated with an existing permit. We have three of the five existing permits off Lake Sakakawea. Additionally, the recently acquired GRR Entities have rights to a vast array of fresh, brackish and effluent water sources with access to significant volumes of water annually. In addition to primary frac water sourcing, we also source brine water and other completion fluids.
 •Water Transfer.  Our water transfer service line provides high‑volume, high‑rate water transfer services through permanent pipeline systems and temporary pipe systems. This service is utilized to transfer water from a source to a containment location on or off the wellsite, from the containment directly to the well to support completion operations, and, in certain circumstances, directly from the source to the well. Our assets include more than 110 miles of operational underground pipeline, approximately 1,400 miles of lay‑flat hose and approximately 1,000 high‑rate water transfer pumps. Additionally, the recently acquired GRR Entities own significant water transport infrastructure, including over 1,200 miles of temporary and permanent pipeline infrastructure and related storage facilities and pumps, all located in the northern Delaware Basin portion of the Permian Basin. The Rockwater Merger added Rockwater’s sizable fleet of small and large diameter pipe and hose and pumps to our water transfer service line and extended our water transfer service capabilities across North America. Our permanent pipeline systems are located in the Bakken, the SCOOP and the Haynesville, as described in more detail below.
 •Bakken: We have invested over $30.0 million in the Charlson Pipeline and the Iverson Pipeline in the Bakken located in McKenzie County, North Dakota, and we are developing a third pipeline system that will serve Williams County and western Mountrail County. The Charlson pipeline system is located on the eastern side of McKenzie County, North Dakota, and consists of 32 miles of operational pipeline. The Iverson pipeline system is located in eastern McKenzie County, North Dakota, and consists of 58 miles of operational pipeline. Of the approximately 90 miles of underground pipeline systems, we own 38 miles and have contractual rights to access the remaining 52 miles. The development of the third permit began in late 2017 and will allow us to utilize 100 million barrels of fresh water per year across the three systems.

 •SCOOP: Through our interest in a joint venture with Access Midstream (subsequently merged with Williams Partners), we own a nine‑mile, underground fresh water delivery pipeline in Grady County, Oklahoma in what we believe to be the core of the SCOOP, with an additional 23 miles of sour gas pipeline that can be subsequently converted to deliver fresh water. The source for this pipeline system originates from the Washita River, a reliable water source in an otherwise dry and drought‑prone region of Oklahoma. We are currently permitted by the Oklahoma Water Resources Board to withdraw 10.8 million barrels of water per year from the river, in excess of the pipeline’s current physical throughput capacity of 9.2 million barrels per year.
 •Haynesville: We own an approximately 12‑mile underground fresh water delivery pipeline in De Soto Parish, Louisiana, which transports effluent from a pump station at International Paper’s Mansfield Plant Outfall No. 1 to five delivery points within the Holly Field for use in fracking operations. The IP Pipeline is located in what we believe is the core acreage of the Haynesville shale.
 Our lay‑flat hose provides a flexible water transfer solution and can be customized to fit a specific project. After the completion of a project, lay‑flat hose can be quickly and cost‑effectively removed and redeployed for a new project, including projects in different geographic regions. Lay‑flat hose has a significantly lower risk of spills than most other types of temporary jointed‑pipe as a result of the strength and durability of the hose as well as the secure nature of any coupling joints used to connect multiple sections of hose. We believe the average length of lay‑flat hose used in a project is approximately 5 miles, but the length can vary from as little as a few hundred feet to as much as 75 miles for a comprehensive water management program. Our lay‑flat hose consists of 8 inch, 10 inch and 12 inch diameter segments. Depending on the requirements of a project, lay‑flat hose may run from a water source directly to a containment area or wellsite or from containment area to containment area. Our customers generally prefer lay‑flat hose to alternative temporary piping options due to the cost‑effectiveness, customizability and reduced risk of spills.
 •Water Containment.  We are the largest provider of high‑capacity above ground storage tanks (“ASTs”) in North America with an inventory offering water storage capacity between 4,500 and 60,000 barrels per tank with remote monitoring capability in every major U.S. basin and Western Canada. Our ASTs provide a low cost containment alternative to frac tanks and support our water treatment and reuse strategy that we bundle with our water transfer and water reuse services to provide enhanced water management solutions to our customers. A 40,000 barrel AST can be delivered by three trucks and be installed in half a day, and replaces 80 500‑barrel frac tanks. Our modular tank design allows for 20 different tank configurations to meet each customer’s individual needs, and we also offer nested tanks for complete secondary containment.
 •Water Treatment and Recycling.  Our water treatment and recycling service line works with oil and gas producers to treat water utilized in the drilling, completion and production processes. Additionally, we offer recycling services for the reuse of flowback, produced or otherwise impaired water for reuse in new well completions. Specifically, we offer water treatment and recycling solutions ranging from basic filtration solutions to the application of chemical disinfection and more advanced technologies, including oil removal, iron removal and the removal of other contaminants. These solutions are offered through in‑house equipment and expertise, as well as with outside strategic relationships and investments.
 •Well Testing and Flowback.  Our well testing and flowback service line provides highly trained personnel and state‑of‑the‑art equipment and technologies to perform a multitude of services relating to the completion and production of oil, gas, condensate and water, including frac support, frac plug drill‑out, flowback, well testing and lease operating. These services are critical to the completion and production phase of a well, as it provides the customer with initial well productivity data which ultimately impacts a reservoir’s capacity to produce hydrocarbons, such as oil, gas and condensate. Our traditional well testing and hydraulic equipment can service a multitude of operational scenarios, such as high and low temperature, high and low pressure, high hydrogen sulfide concentration and high volume. Currently, we own approximately 280 equipment spreads to support this broad range of services.

 
  11

 

 •Fluid Hauling.  Our fluid hauling service line transports and stores water and various drilling, completion and production fluids utilizing our fleet of vacuum trucks, winch trucks, hydrovac trucks, and related assets, such as frac tanks. Currently, we own and lease approximately 200 tractors and own approximately 990 frac tanks.
 •Fluid Disposal.  We own 18 salt water disposal (“SWD”) wells with a daily maximum permitted disposal volume of approximately 300,000 bpd. Our SWD wells are located in the Eagle Ford (6), Permian (4), Haynesville (3), Marcellus (2), MidCon (2) and Rockies (1) regions.

 Customers
 Our Water Solutions customers primarily include major integrated and independent U.S. and international oil and gas producers.
 Competition
 Many large domestic and international oilfield services companies offer some water‑oriented and environmental services, though these are generally ancillary to their core businesses. As a result, the water solutions industry is highly fragmented and our main competitors are typically smaller or mid‑sized and often private service providers that focus on water solutions and logistical services across a narrow geographic range. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by delivering the highest‑quality services and equipment possible, coupled with superior execution and operating efficiency in a safe working environment. Oilfield Chemicals
 Our Oilfield Chemicals segment is operated primarily under our subsidiary, Rockwater LLC, and develops, manufactures and provides a full suite of chemicals utilized in hydraulic fracturing, stimulation, cementing and well completions, including polymers that create viscosity, crosslinkers, friction reducers, surfactants, buffers, breakers and other chemical technologies, to leading pressure pumping service companies in the United States.

 Competition
 Historically, our competition has varied significantly by service line. The market for accommodations and rentals has been serviced by a relatively fragmented competitor base ranging from small local companies and privately‑owned regional service companies to large private and public companies operating across diverse geographies. Our main competitors in the market for wellsite completion and construction services are typically smaller or mid‑sized, and often private, service providers that focus on construction and field services across a narrow geographic range. Our competitors in the market for sand hauling are typically regionally focused smaller or mid‑sized service providers. Our primary competitors in our Canadian operations are regionally focused smaller or mid‑sized service providers. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by delivering the highest‑quality services and equipment possible, coupled with superior execution and operating efficiency in a safe working environment. Significant Customer

The team consists of professionals with advanced degrees and experience in areas as diverse as geology, geography, petroleum and chemical engineering, computer science, environmental science, geographic information systems and regulatory affairs. This group has been designed to help customers develop and execute water solutions for wide‑scale development projects, with our professionals integrating themselves into our customers’ operations teams at the outset of the planning process. Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
 Our water‑related and wellsite completion and construction operations in support of oil and gas exploration, development and production activities pursued by our customers are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in the United States and Western Canada governing occupational safety and health, the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection. Numerous governmental entities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions. These laws and regulations may, among other things (i) require the acquisition of permits to take fresh water from surface water and groundwater, construct pipelines or containment facilities, drill wells and other regulated activities; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into non‑producing formations; (iii) limit or prohibit our operations on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; (iv) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations; (v) impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection; and (vi) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of delays in the permitting or performance of projects; and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations in a particular area.
 The trend in United States and Canadian environmental regulation in recent years has been typically to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re‑interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly construction, completion or water management activities, or waste handling, storage transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third‑party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. Our customers may also incur increased costs or delays or restrictions in permitting or operating activities as a result of more stringent 

 
  16

 
environmental laws and regulations, which may result in a curtailment of exploration, development or production activities that would reduce the demand for our services.
 United States Operations
 The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational safety and health laws, as amended from time to time, to which our operations in the United States are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
 Hazardous substances and wastes. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non‑hazardous wastes. Pursuant to rules issued by the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA, and instead are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non‑hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil and gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non‑hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, following the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2016 by several non‑governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency’s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, the EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the District Court in December 2016. Under the decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our and our oil and gas producing customers’ costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our and our customers’ results of operations and financial position. In the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes.
 Wastes containing naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) may also be generated in connection with our operations. Certain processes used to produce oil and gas may enhance the radioactivity of NORM, which may be present in oilfield wastes. NORM is subject primarily to individual state radiation control regulations. In addition, NORM handling and management activities are governed by regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). These state and OSHA regulations impose certain requirements concerning worker protection, the treatment, storage and disposal of NORM waste, the management of waste piles, containers and tanks containing NORM, as well as restrictions on the uses of land with NORM contamination.
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current and past owner or operator of the site where the hazardous substance release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. In addition, neighboring landowners and other third parties may file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances.
 We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for activities supporting oil and gas exploration, development and production for a number of years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or petroleum 

 
  17

 
hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off‑site locations, where we conduct services for our customers or where such substances have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake response actions or corrective measures, which could include removal of previously disposed substances and wastes, cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial operations to prevent future contamination, the costs of which could be material.
 Water discharges and use. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and hazardous substances, into state waters and waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements imposed under the CWA require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities.
 The CWA also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) published a final rule attempting to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States, but legal challenges to this rule followed, and the rule was stayed nationwide by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in October 2015 pending resolution of the court challenges. In January 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court accepted review of the rule to determine whether jurisdiction rests with the federal district or appellate courts, and, in a decision issued on January 22, 2018, held that legal challenges of the rule must be heard at the district rather than appellate court level. Additionally, following the issuance of a presidential executive order to review the rule, the EPA and the Corps proposed a rulemaking in June 2017 to repeal the June 2015 rule. The EPA and the Corps also announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the CWA’s jurisdiction. On February 6, 2018, the EPA and Corps published a final rule specifying that the contested June 2015 rule would not take effect until February 6, 2020. As a result, future implementation of the June 2015 rule is uncertain at this time. To the extent this rule or a revised rule expands the scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas in connection with any expansion activities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non‑compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
 The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) amends the CWA and sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills in waters of the United States. The OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities, and onshore facilities, including E&P facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under OPA, responsible parties including owners and operators of onshore facilities may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. The OPA also requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare Facility Response Plans for responding to a worst‑case discharge of oil into waters of the United States.
 Salt water disposal wells and induced seismicity. Salt water disposal via underground injection is regulated pursuant to the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program established under the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act (the “SDWA”) and analogous state and local laws and regulations. The UIC program includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. State regulations require a permit from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate underground injection wells. Although we monitor the injection process of our wells, any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of our UIC permit, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by 

 
  18

 
third‑parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property and personal injuries. A change in UIC disposal well regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect our ability to dispose of produced waters and other substances, which could affect our business.
 Furthermore, in response to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of produced water resulting from oil and gas activities, federal and some state agencies are investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have restricted, suspended or shut down the use of such disposal wells. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma issued new rules for wastewater disposal wells in 2014 that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, has developed and implemented plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. The Texas Railroad Commission adopted similar rules in 2014. In December 2016, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission’s Oil and Gas Conservation Division and the Oklahoma Geological Survey released well completion seismicity guidance, which requires operators to take certain prescriptive actions, including an operator’s planned mitigation practices, following certain unusual seismic activity within 1.25 miles of hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission’s Oil and Gas Conservation Division issued an order in February 2017 limiting future increases in the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater injected below ground into the Arbuckle formation in an effort to reduce the number of earthquakes in the state, and imposed further reductions in the Edmonds area of the state in August 2017. In addition, ongoing lawsuits allege that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. The adoption and implementation of any new laws, regulations or directives that restrict our ability to dispose of wastewater gathered from our customers by limiting volumes, disposal rates, disposal well locations or otherwise, or requiring us to shut down disposal wells, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Hydraulic fracturing activities. As noted, hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or other proppants and chemical additives under pressure into targeted geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing is currently generally exempt from regulation under the UIC program established under the SDWA. Hydraulic fracturing is regulated by state oil and gas commissions or similar agencies.
 However, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in 2014, the EPA asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA’s UIC program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities. Additionally, in June 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and, in 2014, published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final rule in 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. However, in June 2016, a Wyoming federal judge struck down this final rule, finding that the BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule, the BLM appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in July 2016, the appellate court issued a ruling in September 2017 to vacate the Wyoming trial court decision and dismiss the lawsuit challenging the 2015 rule in response to the BLM’s issuance of a proposed rulemaking to rescind the 2015 rule and, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the 2015 rule. In January 2018, litigation challenging the BLM’s recission of the 2015 rule was brought in federal court. In January 2018, litigation challenging the BLM’s recissionof the 2015 rule was brought in federal court. 
 From time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In the event that new federal restrictions on the hydraulic‑fracturing process are adopted in areas where we or our customers conduct business, we or our customers may incur additional costs or permitting requirements to comply with such federal requirements that may be significant in nature and our customers could experience added delays or curtailment in their exploration, development, or production activities, which would in turn reduce the demand for our services.

 
  19

 

 Moreover, some states and local governments have adopted, and other governmental entities are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well‑construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations, including states where we or our customers operate. For example, Texas, Oklahoma, California, Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Dakota, among others, have adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal and well‑construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. States could also elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular, as certain local governments in California have done. Other states, such as Texas, Oklahoma and Ohio have taken steps to limit the authority of local governments to regulate oil and gas development.
 In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources “under some circumstances,” noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local‑ or regional‑scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. The EPA’s study report did not find a direct link between the action of hydraulically fracturing the well itself and contamination of groundwater resources. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs for our customers in the production of oil and gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and an associated decrease in demand for our services, increased compliance costs and time, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.
 Air Emissions. The U.S. Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources through air emissions standards, construction and operating permit programs and the imposition of other compliance standards. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre‑approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay our projects as well as our customers’ development of oil and gas projects. Over the next several years, we or our customers may incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions‑related issues. For example, in 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground‑level ozone from the current standard of 75 parts per million to 70 parts per million under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. The EPA published a final rule on November 16, 2017 that issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone for approximately 85% of the U.S. counties as either “attainment/unclassifiable” or “unclassifiable” that became effective on January 18, 2018, and is expected to issue attainment or non-attainment designations for the remaining areas of the U.S. not addressed in the November 2017 final rule in the first half of 2018. Reclassification of areas or imposition of more stringent standards may make it more difficult to construct new facilities or modify existing facilities in these newly designated non‑attainment areas. Also, states are expected to implement more stringent requirements as a result of this new final rule, which could apply to our and our customers’ operations. In another example, in June 2016, the EPA published a final rule updating federal permitting regulations for stationary sources in the oil and natural gas industry by defining and clarifying the meaning of the term “adjacent” for determining when separate surface sites and the equipment at those sites will be aggregated for permitting purposes. Compliance with these or other air pollution control and permitting requirements has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our or our customers’ costs of development and production, which costs could reduce demand for our services and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

 
  20

 

 Climate Change. In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that emit certain principal, or “criteria,” pollutants. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from oil and gas production, processing, transmission and storage facilities in the United States.
 Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs but there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions through the completion of GHG emissions inventories and by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. The EPA has also developed strategies for the reduction of methane emissions, including emissions from the oil and gas industry. For example, in June 2016, the EPA published New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) Subpart OOOOa requirements to reduce methane and volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions from certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. These Subpart OOOOa standards will expand previously issued NSPS published by the EPA in 2012, and known as Subpart OOOO, by using certain equipment‑specific emissions control practices. However, the Quad OOOOa standards have been subject to attempts by the EPA to stay portions of those standards, and the agency proposed rulemaking in June 2017 to stay the requirements for a period of two years and revisit implementation of Subpart OOOOa in its entirety. The EPA has not yet published a final rule, and, as a result of these developments, EPA’s 2016 standards are currently in effect, but future implementation of the 2016 standards is uncertain at this time. Because of the long‑term trend toward increasing regulation, however, future federal GHG regulations of the oil and natural gas industry remain a possibility. Furthermore, in June 2017, the BLM published a final rule that established, among other things, requirements to reduce methane emissions arising from venting, flaring and leakage from oil and gas production activities on onshore federal and American Indian lands. However, on December 8, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to temporarily suspend or delay certain requirements contained in the November 2016 final rule until January 17, 2019, including those requirements relating to venting, flaring and leakage from oil and gas production activities. On February 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California enjoined the delay of certain requirements contained in the November 2016 rule. As a result, the November 2016 rule, as originally proumulgated, is in effect. Also, on February 22, 2018, the BLM published a proposed rule that would generally re-establish the requirements that the November 2016 rule replaced. Litigation regarding the November 2016 rule is ongoing and uncertainty exists with respect to future implementation of the rule. However, given the long‑term trend towards increasing regulation, future federal GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility. 
 Additionally, in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that proposed an agreement, requiring member countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. This agreement was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016; however, the GHG emission reductions called for by the Paris Agreement are not binding. In August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four‑year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re‑enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.
 Although it is not possible at this time to predict how new laws or regulations in the United States or any legal requirements imposed by the Paris Agreement on the United States, should it not withdraw from the agreement, that may be adopted or issued to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws, regulations or other legal requirements imposing reporting or permitting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our or our customers’ equipment and operations could require us or our customers to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs 

 
  21

 
associated with operations as well as result in delays or restrictions in the ability to permit GHG emissions from new or modified sources. In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and gas our customers produce, which could reduce demand for our services. Moreover, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time. Finally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our and our customers’ operations.
 Endangered Species. The federal Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act (the “MBTA”). To the extent species that are listed under the ESA or similar state laws, or are protected under the MBTA, live in the areas where we or our oil and gas producing customers operate, our and our customers’ abilities to conduct or expand operations and construct facilities could be limited or be forced to incur material additional costs. Moreover, our customers’ drilling activities may be delayed, restricted, or precluded in protected habitat areas or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons. Some of our operations and the operations of our customers are located in areas that are designated as habitats for protected species. In addition, as a result of one or more settlements entered into by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (the “FWS”), the agency is required to make a determination on the listing of numerous other species as endangered or threatened under the ESA pursuant to specific timelines. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could indirectly cause us to incur additional costs, cause our or our oil and gas producing customers’ operations to become subject to operating restrictions or bans and limit future development activity in affected areas. The FWS and similar state agencies may designate critical or suitable habitat areas that they believe are necessary for the survival of threatened or endangered species. Such a designation could materially restrict use of or access to federal, state, and private lands.
 Chemical Safety. We are subject to a wide array of laws and regulations governing chemicals, including the regulation of chemical substances and inventories, such as TSCA in the United States and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act in Canada. These laws and regulations change frequently, and have the potential to limit or ban altogether the types of chemicals we may use in our products, as well as result in increased costs related to testing, storing, and transporting our products prior to providing them to our customers. For example, in June 2016, President Obama signed into law the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (the “Lautenberg Act”), which substantially revised TSCA. Amongst other items, the Lautenberg Act eliminated the cost‑benefit approach to analyzing chemical safety concerns with a health‑based safety standard and requires all chemicals in commerce, including those “grandfathered” under TSCA, to undergo a safety review. The Lautenberg Act also requires safety findings before a new chemical can enter the market. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how EPA will implement and interpret the new provisions of the Lautenberg Act, or how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted pursuant to these regulatory and legislative efforts would impact our business, any new restrictions on the development of new products, increases in regulation, or disclosure of confidential, competitive information could have an adverse effect on our operations and our cost of doing business.
 Furthermore, governmental, regulatory and societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection could result in increased pressure for more stringent regulatory control with respect to the chemical industry. In addition, these concerns could influence public perceptions regarding our products and operations, the viability of certain products, our reputation, the cost to comply with regulations, and the ability to attract and retain employees. Moreover, changes in environmental, health and safety regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations, or require us to modify our facilities or operations. Accordingly, environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities, which could reduce our profitability.
 Occupational Safety and Health and other legal requirements. We are subject to the requirements of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA’s hazard communication standard, the EPA’s Emergency Planning and Community Right‑to‑Know Act and comparable state regulations and any implementing regulations require that we 

 
  22

 
organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our United States operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. We have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with worker safety requirements.
 In addition, as part of the services we provide, we operate as a motor carrier and therefore are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“U.S. DOT”) and analogous U.S. state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, regulatory safety, and hazardous materials labeling, placarding and marking. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. From time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes on motor fuels, among other things, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted.
 Western Canadian Operations
 Environmental regulation in Canada, including the Western Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, is carried out at both the federal and provincial levels. Unless the exploration and production of hydrocarbon resources is occurring on federal lands, such as lands held by First Nations, national parks, national defense lands or offshore, the main oversight over the extraction of natural resources falls within provincial jurisdiction. However, the federal government has shared oversight over assessing whether substances are toxic to both humans and the environment and the control of the use of such substances pursuant to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. In addition, the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, administered by Transport Canada, regulates road, rail, air and marine transportation of fracturing fluids, produced water, fracturing fluid waste and flowback. The following is a summary of the more significant environmental regulations in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada, as amended from time to time, to which our operations in Canada are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
 Hydraulic fracturing activities. Operations related to water, stimulation, and fracturing fluids in support of oil and gas exploration, development and production are subject to provincial environmental regulations. Currently, our operations occur in the western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. In Alberta, the Alberta Energy Regulator (“AER”) has jurisdiction over the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act, and associated regulations and Directives, as well as parts of the Water Act, relating to the extraction of hydrocarbons. In particular, the AER has regulatory directives relating to groundwater protection, wellbore integrity, noise and light impacts, air quality and induced seismicity. The AER’s Directives require licensees conducting hydraulic fracturing to report amounts and sources of water and chemicals used in each job. The type and volume of all additives used in fracturing fluids must also be submitted to the AER. Licensees in Alberta are also subject to stringent storage and drilling waste management requirements. Companies who own and operate permanent facilities are subject to additional regulations.
 In British Columbia, the British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission (the “BCOGC”) is the provincial regulatory body responsible for overseeing oil and gas operations. Like Alberta, British Columbia has developed a single‑window approach to administer the provisions of wide ranging acts and regulations which include the regulation of the exploration, development, transportation and reclamation of oil and gas activities. The regulation of hydraulic fracturing in British Columbia is conducted under numerous provincial acts and technical regulations. The BCOGC administers British Columbia’s main legislative framework relating to oil and gas, the Oil and Gas Activities Act, and its associated regulations which regulate public safety and environmental protection related to hydraulic fracturing, such as the Drilling and Production Regulation and the Environmental Protection and Management Regulation. Further, other specific provisions of the Water Act, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Act, the Heritage Conservation Act, the Land Act and the Environmental Management Act also regulate elements of hydraulic fracturing. Fracture Fluid Reports are required to be submitted and are publicly searchable online. Chemical disclosure including trade name, supplier, purpose, ingredients and volume of water with injected ingredients must be submitted to an online database.

 Water usage. Besides the AER, the other major legislative and regulatory requirements in Alberta related to our operations in Western Canada fall under the administration of the Alberta Environment and Parks ministry. Environment and Parks oversees parts of the Water Act and the Water Conservation and Allocation Policy for Oilfield Injection for long‑term water injection projects for the recovery of oil, requiring industry to seek deep saline groundwater and technological alternatives to minimize use of fresh water. While this policy is applicable to conventional water flooding and oil sands in‑situ operations, expanding the policy to apply water conservation principles to subsectors of the upstream oil and gas industry, including hydraulic fracturing, has been proposed. In British Columbia, the Water Sustainability Act came into effect in 2016 and has resulted in changes to surface water and groundwater allocation, requiring authorizations to be obtained to use groundwater for anything other than domestic use. The BCOGC has recently strengthened regulations relating to induced seismicity due to hydraulic fracturing based on two reports and continues to conduct monitoring and research in order to adequately respond and mitigate this issue.
 Induced seismicity. Due to increased seismicity believed to be associated with hydraulic fracturing, in 2015 the AER released new guidelines requiring new seismic monitoring and reporting requirements for hydraulic fracturing. The BCOGC completed two reports on seismic events related to hydraulic fracturing, and has imposed mitigation measures, including regulations to shut down industry operations if seismic activity reaches a certain threshold.
 Climate change. The Canadian federal government, as well as the provincial governments have either proposed or have instituted a carbon tax in response to the global push to combat climate change. While a carbon tax in British Columbia has been in place since 2008, which is currently $30 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, as of January 1, 2017, Alberta has instituted a provincial carbon tax of $20 per tonne, rising to $30 per tonne in 2018. The federal government has proposed a minimum price on carbon, beginning in 2018 at $10 per tonne, rising to $50 per tonne in 2022, which will be implemented by the federal government if the provinces do not already have an equivalent framework in place. The carbon tax will have a significant impact on energy intensive businesses.
 The Government of Alberta also announced in 2015 that under its Climate Leadership Plan, the province will have zero emissions from coal‑fired electricity by 2030. As approximately 55% of Alberta’s electricity in being produced from coal‑fired generators, natural gas‑fired electricity is expected to increase significantly to fill this gap. Oil and gas producers will be required to reduce methane emissions associated with their facilities by 45% by 2025 and a cap of 100 megatonnes per year of carbon emissions from oil sands production has been imposed. The federal government also announced that it intends to virtually eliminate the use of coal‑fired electricity by 2030, which currently accounts for 11% of Canada’s electricity capacity.
 Seasonality
 Our results of operations have historically reflected seasonal tendencies, typically in the fourth quarter, relating to holiday seasons, inclement winter weather and the conclusion of our customers’ annual drilling and completions capital expenditure budgets during which we typically experience declines in our operating results. In a stable commodity price and operations environment, October has historically been our most active month, with notable declines in November and December for the reasons described above. Intellectual Property
 Protection of our products and processes is important to our businesses. We own numerous patents and, where appropriate, we file patent applications for new products and technologies. For example, we use our AquaView® technology to quantify volumes and flow rates to verify current and potential water availability and volumes when analyzing a new water source. We also currently own six U.S. patents relating to completions technology including borate cross‑linkers, slurry monitoring systems and others. We also have a robust program to seek patents on new developments. We are currently seeking patents on eight new technologies, including a water treatment process and a proprietary water analytics and automation tool, as well as creating fracturing fluids with produced water, evaporation methodologies, cross‑linker/breaker mechanisms and liquid distribution metering systems. We hold numerous patents and, while a presumption of validity exists with respect to issued U.S. patents, we cannot assure that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Furthermore, we cannot assure the issuance of any pending patent application, or that if patents do issue, that these patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. Additionally, our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner.

 
  24

 

 We also rely upon unpatented proprietary know‑how, continuing technological innovation and trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance, however, that confidentiality and other agreements into which we enter and have entered will not be breached, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know‑how, or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know‑how. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not obtain knowledge of these trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means.
 We also own a number of trademarks, which we use in connection with our businesses. In addition to protections through federal registration, we also rely on state common law protections to protect our brand. There can be no assurance that the trademark registrations will provide meaningful protection against the use of similar trademarks by competitors, or that the value of our trademarks will not be diluted.
 Because of the breadth and nature of our intellectual property rights and our business, we do not believe that any single intellectual property right (other than certain trademarks for which we intend to maintain the applicable registrations) is material to our business. Moreover, we do not believe that the termination of intellectual property rights expected to occur over the next several years, either individually or in the aggregate, will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Risk Management and Insurance
 Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and gas industry, including accidents, blowouts, explosions, craterings, fires, oil spills and hazardous materials spills. These conditions can cause:
 •personal injury or loss of life;
 •damage to, or destruction of property, the environment and wildlife; and
 •the suspension of our or our customers’ operations.
 In addition, claims for loss of oil and gas production and damage to formations can occur in the well services industry. If a serious accident were to occur at a location where our equipment and services are being used, it could result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.
 Because our business involves the transportation of heavy equipment and materials, we may also experience traffic accidents which may result in spills, property damage and personal injury.
 Despite our efforts to maintain high safety standards, from time to time, we have suffered accidents, and there is a risk that we will experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property and personal losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability, and our relationship with customers, employees and regulatory agencies. In particular, in recent years many of our large customers have placed an increased emphasis on the safety records of their service providers. Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensatory payments, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance, and could have other material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
 We maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry including workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, sudden & accidental pollution, umbrella, comprehensive commercial general liability, business automobile and property and equipment physical damage insurance. Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover our liabilities. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable and commercially justifiable or on terms as favorable as our current arrangements.
 We enter into master service agreements (“MSAs”) with each of our customers. Our MSAs delineate our and our customer’s respective indemnification obligations with respect to the services we provide. Generally, under our 

 
  25

 
MSAs, including those relating to our Water Solutions and Related Services, Oilfield Chemical Product Sales, Accommodations and Rentals and Completion and Construction Services, we assume responsibility for pollution or contamination originating above the surface from our equipment or handling of the equipment of others. However, our customers assume responsibility for all other pollution or contamination that may occur during operations, including that which may result from seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of drilling fluids. The assumed responsibilities include the control, removal and clean‑up of any pollution or contamination. In such cases, we may be exposed to additional liability if we are grossly negligent or commit willful acts causing the pollution or contamination. Generally, our customers also agree to indemnify us against claims arising from the personal injury or death of the customers’ employees or those of the customers’ other contractors, in the case of our hydraulic fracturing operations, to the extent that such employees are injured by such operations, unless the loss is a result of our gross negligence or willful misconduct. Similarly, we generally agree to indemnify our customers for liabilities arising from personal injury to or death of any of our employees or employees of any of our subcontractors, unless resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of our customer. The same principals apply to mutual indemnification for loss or destruction of customer‑owned property or equipment, except such indemnification is not limited in an instance of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Losses arising from catastrophic events, such as blowouts, are generally the responsibility of the customer. However, despite this general allocation of risk, we may be unsuccessful in enforcing contractual terms, incur an unforeseen liability that is not addressed by the scope of the contractual provisions or be required to enter into an MSA with terms that vary from our standard allocations of risk, as described above. Consequently, we may incur substantial losses that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 5,100 employees and no unionized labor. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
