Item 1 Business
Synalloy Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in 1958 as the successor to a chemical manufacturing business founded in 1945. Its charter is perpetual. The name was changed on July 31, 1967 from Blackman Uhler Industries, Inc. The Company's executive office is located at 4510 Cox Road, Suite 201, Richmond, Virginia 23060 with an additional corporate and shared services office at 775 Spartan Boulevard, Suite 102, Spartanburg, South Carolina 29301. Unless indicated otherwise, the terms "Company," "we" "us," and "our" refer to Synalloy Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
The Company's business is divided into two reportable operating segments, the Metals Segment and the Specialty Chemicals Segment. The Metals Segment operates as three reporting units, all International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") certified manufacturers, including Bristol Metals, LLC ("BRISMET"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Synalloy Metals, Inc., Palmer of Texas Tanks, Inc. ("Palmer") and Specialty Pipe & Tube, Inc. ("Specialty"). BRISMET manufactures stainless steel and other alloy pipe and tube. Palmer manufactures liquid storage solutions and separation equipment, and Specialty is a master distributor of seamless carbon pipe and tube. The Metals Segment's markets include the oil and gas, chemical, petrochemical, pulp and paper, mining, power generation (including nuclear), water and waste water treatment, liquid natural gas ("LNG"), brewery, food processing, petroleum, pharmaceutical and other heavy industries. The Specialty Chemicals Segment operates as one reporting unit which includes Manufacturers Chemicals, LLC ("MC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manufacturers Soap and Chemical Company ("MS&C"), and CRI Tolling, LLC ("CRI Tolling"). The Specialty Chemicals Segment produces specialty chemicals for the chemical, paper, metals, mining, agricultural, fiber, paint, textile, automotive, petroleum, cosmetics, mattress, furniture, janitorial and other industries. MC manufactures lubricants, surfactants, defoamers, reaction intermediaries and sulfated fats and oils. CRI Tolling provides chemical tolling manufacturing resources to global and regional chemical companies and contracts with other chemical companies to manufacture certain, pre-defined products. 
General
Metals Segment – This segment is comprised of three wholly-owned subsidiaries: Synalloy Metals, Inc., which owns 100 percent of BRISMET, located in Bristol, Tennessee and Munhall, Pennsylvania; Palmer, located in Andrews, Texas; and Specialty, located in Mineral Ridge, Ohio and Houston, Texas.
BRISMET manufactures welded pipe and tube, primarily from stainless steel, but also from other corrosion-resistant metals. Pipe is produced in sizes from one-half inch to 120 inches in diameter and wall thickness up to one and one-half inches. Eighteen-inch and smaller diameter pipe is made on equipment that forms and welds the pipe in a continuous process. Pipe larger than 18 inches in diameter is formed on presses or rolls and welded on batch welding equipment. Pipe is normally produced in standard 20-foot lengths. However, BRISMET has unusual capabilities in the production of long length pipe without circumferential welds. This can reduce the installation cost for the customer. Lengths up to 60 feet can be produced in sizes up to 18 inches in diameter. In larger sizes, BRISMET has a unique ability among domestic producers to make 48-foot lengths in diameters up to 36 inches. Over the past four years, BRISMET has made substantial capital improvements, installing an energy efficient furnace to anneal pipe

quicker while minimizing natural gas usage; system improvements in pickling to maintain the proper chemical composition of the pickling acid; and developing a heavy wall/quick turn welded pipe production shop by adding a 4,000 tonne press along with all necessary ancillary processes. BRISMET's Munhall facility manufactures welded pipe as well as new product offerings in welded tubing in diameters from 5/8 inch to 8 inches and gauges in diameters from 0.028 inches to 0.120 inches. The Munhall facility was designed for improved product flow and the latest technology including laser welding and in-line annealing.
Palmer is a manufacturer of fiberglass and steel storage tanks for the oil and gas, waste water treatment and municipal water industries. Located in Andrews, Texas, Palmer is ideally located in the heart of a significant oil and gas production territory. Palmer produces made-to-order fiberglass tanks, utilizing a variety of custom mandrels and application specific materials. Its fiberglass tanks range from two feet to 30 feet in diameter at various heights. The majority of these tanks are used for oil field waste water capture and are an integral part of the environmental regulatory compliance of the drilling process. Each fiberglass tank is manufactured to American Petroleum Institute Q1 standards to ensure product quality. Palmer's steel storage tank facility enables efficient, environmentally compliant production with designed-in expansion capability to support future growth. Finished steel tanks range in size predominantly from 50 to 1,500 barrels and are used to store extracted oil. During 2014, Palmer obtained all of the necessary certifications to produce certified pressure vessels. These certifications allow Palmer to sell all of the separator and storage equipment needed at a well site.
Specialty is a leading master distributor of hot finish, seamless, carbon steel pipe and tubing, with an emphasis on large outside diameters and exceptionally heavy wall thickness. Specialty's products are primarily used for mechanical and high pressure applications in the oil and gas, capital goods manufacturing, heavy industrial, construction equipment, paper and chemical industries. Operating from facilities located in Mineral Ridge, Ohio and Houston, Texas, Specialty is well-positioned to serve the major industrial and energy regions and successfully reach other target markets across the United States. Specialty performs value-added processing on approximately 80 percent of products shipped, which would include cutting to length, heat treatment, testing, boring and end finishing and typically processes and ships orders in 24 hours or less. Based upon its short lead times, Specialty plays a critical role in the supply chain, supplying long lead-time items to markets that demand fast deliveries, custom lengths and reliable execution of orders.
In order to establish stronger business relationships, the Metals Segment uses only a few raw material suppliers. Nine suppliers furnish approximately 80 percent of total dollar purchases of raw materials, with one supplier furnishing 40 percent of material purchases. However, the Company does not believe that the loss of this supplier would have a materially adverse effect on the Company as raw materials are readily available from a number of different sources, and the Company anticipates no difficulties in fulfilling its requirements.
Specialty Chemicals Segment – This segment consists of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary MS&C. MS&C owns 100 percent of the membership interests of MC, which has a production facility in Cleveland, Tennessee. This segment also includes CRI Tolling which is located in Fountain Inn, South Carolina. MC and CRI Tolling are aggregated as one reporting unit and comprise the Specialty Chemicals Segment. Both facilities are fully licensed for chemical manufacture. MC manufactures lubricants, surfactants, defoamers, reaction intermediaries and sulfated fats and oils. CRI Tolling provides chemical tolling manufacturing resources to global and regional companies and contracts with other chemical companies to manufacture certain pre-defined products.
MC produces over 1,100 specialty formulations and intermediates for use in a wide variety of applications and industries. MC's primary product lines focus on the areas of defoamers, surfactants and lubricating agents. These three fundamental product lines find their way into a large number of manufacturing businesses. Over the years, the customer list has grown to include end users and chemical companies that supply paper, metal working, surface coatings, water treatment, paint, mining, oil and gas and janitorial applications. MC's capabilities also include the sulfation of fats and oils. These products are used in a wide variety of applications and represent a renewable resource, animal and vegetable derivatives, as alternatives to more expensive and non-renewable petroleum derivatives. 
MC's strategy has been to focus on industries and markets that have good prospects for sustainability in the U.S. in light of global trends. MC's marketing strategy relies on sales to end users through its own sales force, but it also sells chemical intermediates to other chemical companies and distributors. It also has close working relationships with a significant number of major chemical companies that outsource their production for regional manufacture and distribution to companies like MC. MC has been ISO registered since 1995.
The Specialty Chemicals Segment maintains six laboratories for applied research and quality control which are staffed by eleven employees.
Most raw materials used by the segment are generally available from numerous independent suppliers and approximately 52 percent of total purchases are from its top 15 suppliers. While some raw material needs are met by a sole supplier or only a few suppliers, the Company anticipates no difficulties in fulfilling its raw material requirements.

Please see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, for financial information about the Company's segments.
Sales and Distribution
Metals Segment – The Metals Segment utilizes separate sales organizations for its different product groups. Stainless steel pipe is sold worldwide under the BRISMET trade name through authorized stocking distributors at warehouse locations throughout the country. Producing sales and providing service to the distributors and end-user customers are BRISMET's President, two outside sales employees, seven independent manufacturers' representatives and eight inside sales employees. Additionally, BRISMET operates international offices in Brussels, Belgium and Shanghai, China, with one person in each office.
Palmer employs three sales professionals that manage the relationship with customers and partnerships to identify and secure new sales. Additionally, the Metals Segment President assists in account relationship management with large customers. Customer feedback and in-field experience generate product enhancements and new product development.
Approximately 80 percent of Specialty's pipe and tube sales are to North American pipe and tube distributors with the remainder comprised of sales to end use customers. In addition to Specialty's President, Specialty utilizes two manufacturers' representatives and nine inside sales employees, whom are located at both locations, to obtain sales orders and service its customers.
The Metals Segment had one domestic customer that accounted for approximately 14 percent of the segment's revenues for 2015. There were no customers representing more than ten percent of the Metals Segment's revenues for 2017 or 2016.
Specialty Chemicals Segment – Specialty chemicals are sold directly to various industries nationwide by five full-time outside sales employees and eight manufacturers' representatives. The Specialty Chemicals Segment has one customer that accounted for approximately 23, 25 and 31 percent of the segment's revenues for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The concentration of sales to this customer declined as a result of this customer moving production of the products previously produced and sold by the Specialty Chemicals Segment in house.
Competition
Metals Segment – Welded stainless steel pipe is the largest sales volume product of the Metals Segment. Although information is not publicly available regarding the sales of most other producers of this product, management believes that the Company is one of the largest domestic producers of such pipe. This commodity product is highly competitive with eight known domestic producers, including the Company, and imports from many different countries. 
Due to the size of the tanks produced and shipped to its customers, the majority of Palmer's products is sold within a 300 mile radius from its plant in Andrews, Texas. There are currently 18 tank producers, with similar capabilities, servicing that same area. 
Specialty is a leader in the specialized products segment of the pipe and tube market by offering an industry-leading in-stock inventory of a broad range of high quality products, including specialized products with limited availability. Specialty's dual branches have both common and regional-specific products and capabilities. There are four known significant pipe and tube distributors with similar capabilities to Specialty.
Specialty Chemicals Segment – The Company is the sole producer of certain specialty chemicals manufactured for other companies under processing agreements and also produces proprietary specialty chemicals. The Company's sales of specialty products are insignificant compared to the overall market for specialty chemicals. The market for most of the products is highly competitive and many competitors have substantially greater resources than does the Company.
Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions
The Company is committed to a long-term strategy of (a) reinvesting capital in our current business segments to foster their organic growth, (b) disposing of underperforming business segments and (c) completing acquisitions that expand our current business segments or establish new manufacturing platforms. Targeted acquisitions are priced to be economically feasible and focus on achieving positive long-term benefits. These acquisitions may be paid for in the form of cash, stock, debt or a combination thereof. The amount and type of consideration and deal charges paid could have a short-term dilutive effect on the Company's earnings per share. However, such transactions are anticipated to provide long-term economic benefit to the Company.
On December 9, 2016, the Company's subsidiary BRISMET, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the stainless steel pipe and tube assets of Marcegaglia USA, Inc. ("MUSA") located in Munhall, PA to enhance its on-going business with additional capacity and technological advantages. The transaction closed on February 28, 2017. The agreement was structured as an asset purchase and excluded MUSA's galvanized and ornamental tubing products. The purchase price for the transaction, which excludes real estate and certain other assets, totaled $14,954,000; the assets purchased from MUSA include inventory, production and 
4

maintenance supplies and equipment less specific identified liabilities assumed. In accordance with the agreement, on December 9, 2016, BRISMET entered into an escrow agreement and deposited $3,000,000 into the escrow fund. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation for the acquisition. As part of the MUSA transaction, BRISMET assumed all of MUSA's rights and obligations pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement between MUSA and the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union AFL-CIO, on behalf of Local Union 5852-22 (the "Union") dated October 1, 2013 (the "CBA"). At the closing of the transaction, BRISMET and the Union amended the CBA to include a modest wage increase and to extend the CBA's termination date to September 30, 2018. A new CBA was ratified that extends the termination date to January 2023.
Environmental Matters
Environmental expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and do not contribute to future revenue generation are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or cleanups are probable and the costs of these assessments and/or cleanups can be reasonably estimated. Changes to laws and environmental issues, including climate change, are made or proposed with some frequency and some of the proposals, if adopted, might directly or indirectly result in a material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units. We are presently unable to foresee the future well enough to quantify such risks. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, for further discussion.
Research and Development Activities
The Company spent approximately $556,000 in 2017, $603,000 in 2016 and $548,000 in 2015 on research and development activities that were expensed in its Specialty Chemicals Segment. Five individuals, all of whom are graduate chemists, are engaged primarily in research and development of new products and processes, the improvement of existing products and processes, and the development of new applications for existing products.
Seasonal Nature of the Business
With the exception of Palmer and Specialty's Houston location, which primarily serves the oil and gas industry, the Company’s businesses and products are generally not subject to any seasonal impact that results in significant variations in revenues from one quarter to another. Fourth quarter revenue and profit for Palmer and Specialty Houston can be as much as 25 percent below the other three quarters due to vacation schedules for customer field crews working at the drill sites.
Backlogs
The Specialty Chemicals Segment operates primarily on the basis of delivering products soon after orders are received. Accordingly, backlogs are not a factor in this business. The same applies to seamless, carbon steel pipe and tubing sales in the Metals Segment. However, backlogs are important in the Metals Segment's welded stainless steel pipe and tank manufacturing operations, where both businesses incur significant dollar value of committed orders in advance of production. Its backlog of open orders for welded stainless steel pipe were $28,783,000 and $18,752,000 and for tanks were $17,192,000 and $9,878,000 at the end of 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Employee Relations
At December 31, 2017, the Company had 533 employees. The Company considers relations with employees to be strong. The number of employees of the Company represented by unions, located at the Bristol, Tennessee, Munhall, Pennsylvania and Mineral Ridge, Ohio facilities, is 223, or 42 percent of the Company's employees. They are represented by three locals affiliated with the United Steelworkers. Collective bargaining contracts for the Steelworkers expire in July 2019, June 2020 and January 2023, respectively.
