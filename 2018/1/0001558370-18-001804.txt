     Item 1. Business
 Overview
 We are a Delaware limited partnership formed in 2015 to own and acquire mineral and royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties throughout the United States of America (“United States”). As an owner of mineral and royalty interests, we are entitled to a portion of the revenues received from the production of oil, natural gas and associated NGLs from the acreage underlying our interests, net of post-production expenses and taxes. We are not obligated to fund drilling and completion costs, lease operating expenses or plugging and abandonment costs at the end of a well’s productive life. Our primary business objective is to provide increasing cash distributions to unitholders resulting from acquisitions from our Sponsors, the Contributing Parties and third parties and from organic growth through the continued development by working interest owners of the properties in which we own an interest.
 On February 8, 2017, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 5,750,000 common units representing limited partner interests, which included 750,000 common units pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units. The mineral and royalty interests making up the Partnership’s initial assets were contributed to the Partnership by the Contributing Parties at the closing of the IPO. As a result, as of December 31, 2016, the Partnership had not yet acquired any of such assets. Unless otherwise indicated, the financial information presented for periods on or after February 8, 2017 refers to the Partnership as a whole. The financial information presented for the periods on or prior to February 7, 2017, is solely that of the Predecessor, Rivercrest Royalties, LLC, and does not include the results of the Partnership as a whole. However, unless otherwise indicated, the reserve data presented in this report is with the respect to all the assets that were contributed to us by the Contributing Parties in connection with our IPO. The mineral and royalty interests underlying the oil, natural gas and NGL production revenues of the Predecessor represented approximately 11% of the Partnership’s total future undiscounted cash flows, based on the reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (“Ryder Scott”) as of December 31, 2016.
 As of December 31, 2017, we owned mineral and royalty interests in approximately 3.7 million gross acres and overriding royalty interests in approximately 2 million gross acres, with approximately 35% of our aggregate acres located in the Permian Basin. We refer to these non-cost-bearing interests collectively as our “mineral and royalty interests.” As of December 31, 2017, over 98% of the acreage subject to our mineral and royalty interests was leased to working interest owners (including 100% of our overriding royalty interests), and substantially all of those leases were held by production. Our mineral and royalty interests are located in 20 states and in nearly every major onshore basin across the continental United States and include ownership in over 50,000 gross producing wells, including over 30,000 wells in the Permian Basin. The geographic breadth of our assets gives us exposure to potential production and reserves from new and existing plays. Over the long term, we expect working interest owners will continue to develop our acreage through infill drilling, horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing, recompletions and secondary and tertiary recovery methods. As an owner of mineral and royalty interests, we benefit from the continued development of the properties in which we own an interest without the need for investment of additional capital by us.

 As of December 31, 2017, the estimated proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves attributable to our interests in our underlying acreage were 20,954 MBoe (49.2% liquids, consisting of 72.4% oil and 27.6% NGLs) based on the reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott. Of these reserves, 73.1% were classified as PDP reserves, 0.4% were classified as PDNP reserves and 26.5% were classified as PUD reserves. The properties underlying our mineral and royalty interests typically have low estimated decline rates. Our PDP reserves have an average estimated yearly decline rate of 8.8% during the initial five-years. PUD reserves included in this estimate are from 750 gross proved undeveloped locations.
 As of December 31, 2016, the estimated proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves attributable solely to our Predecessor’s interests in its underlying acreage were 2,311 MBoe (48.5% liquids, consisting of 79.0% oil and 21.0% NGLs) based on the reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott. Of these reserves, 58.9% were classified as PDP reserves, 1.5% were classified as PDNP reserves and 39.6% were classified as PUD reserves. The properties underlying our Predecessor’s mineral and royalty interests typically had low estimated decline rates. Our Predecessor’s PDP reserves had an average estimated yearly decline rate of 9.6% during the initial five-years. PUD reserves included in this estimate were from 355 gross proved undeveloped locations.
 Our revenues are derived from royalty payments we receive from the operators of our properties based on the sale of oil and natural gas production, as well as the sale of NGLs that are extracted from natural gas during processing. As of December 31, 2017, there were over 700 operators actively producing on our acreage, with our top ten operators (Occidental Permian Ltd., XTO Energy, Inc., Aera Energy LLC (a joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell plc and ExxonMobil Corporation), Devon Energy Production Company, LP, Hess Corporation, Chesapeake Operating, Inc., Protégé Energy III LLC, Jonah Energy LLC, Energen Resources Corporation and SEM Operating) together accounting for approximately 45.03% of our combined net income. As of December 31, 2017, there were 19 rigs operating on our acreage compared to 15 rigs on our acreage as of December 29, 2016. Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in commodity prices. 
 For the period from February 8, 2017 to December 31, 2017, our revenues were generated 58% from oil sales, 28% from natural gas sales, 11% from NGL sales and 3% from other sales. For the period from January 1, 2017 to February 7, 2017 (the “Predecessor 2017 Period”), our Predecessor’s revenues were generated 55% from oil sales, 36% from natural gas sales and 9% from NGL sales. For the combined year ended December 31, 2017, the revenues were generated 58% from oil sales, 28% from natural gas sales, 11% from NGL sales and 3% from other sales. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our Predecessor’s revenues were derived 60% from oil sales, 30% from natural gas sales and 10% from NGL sales.
 Our Assets
 We categorize our assets into two groups: mineral interests and overriding royalty interests.
 Mineral Interests
 Mineral interests are real property interests that are typically perpetual and grant ownership to all the oil and natural gas lying below the surface of the property, as well as the right to explore, drill and produce oil and natural gas on that property or to lease such rights to a third party. Mineral owners typically grant oil and gas leases to operators for an initial three‑year term with an upfront cash payment to the mineral owners known as a lease bonus. Under the lease, the mineral owner retains a royalty interest entitling it to a cost‑free percentage (usually ranging from 20‑25%) of production or revenue from production. The lease can be extended beyond the initial term with continuous drilling, production or other operating activities. When production or drilling ceases on the leased property, the lease is typically terminated, subject to certain exceptions, and all mineral rights revert back to the mineral owner who can then lease the exploration and development rights to another party. We also own royalty interests that have been carved out of mineral interests and are known as nonparticipating royalty interests. Nonparticipating royalty interests are typically perpetual and have rights similar to mineral interests, including the right to a cost‑free percentage of production revenues for minerals extracted from the acreage, without the associated executive right to lease and the right to receive lease bonuses.
 We combine our mineral and nonparticipating royalty assets into one category because they share many of the same characteristics due to the nature of the underlying interest. For example, we receive similar royalties from operators with respect to our mineral interests or nonparticipating royalty interests as long as such interests are subject to an oil and gas lease. As of December 31, 2017, over 98% of the acreage subject to our mineral and nonparticipating royalty interests 

 
  10

 
was leased. When evaluating our business, our management team does not distinguish between mineral and nonparticipating royalty interests on leased acreage due to the similarity of the royalties received by the interests.
 Overriding Royalty Interests
 In addition to mineral interests, we also own overriding royalty interests, which are royalty interests that burden the working interests of a lease and represent the right to receive a fixed, cost‑free percentage of production or revenue from production from a lease. Overriding royalty interests typically remain in effect until the associated lease expires, and because substantially all the underlying leases are perpetual so long as production in paying quantities perpetuates the leasehold, substantially all of our overriding royalty interests are likewise perpetual. Business Strategies
 Our primary business objective is to provide increasing cash distributions to unitholders resulting from acquisitions from our Sponsors, the Contributing Parties and third parties and from organic growth through the continued development by working interest owners of the properties in which we own an interest. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following strategies:
· | Acquire additional mineral and royalty interests from our Sponsors and the Contributing Parties. The Contributing Parties, including affiliates of our Sponsors, continue to own significant mineral and royalty interests in oil and gas properties. We believe our Sponsors and the Contributing Parties view our partnership as part of their growth strategy. In addition, we believe their direct or indirect ownership in us will incentivize them to offer us additional mineral and royalty interests from their existing asset portfolios in the future. In connection with our IPO, certain of the Contributing Parties granted us a right of first offer for a period of three years with respect to certain mineral and royalty interests in the Permian Basin, the Bakken/Williston Basin and the Marcellus Shale. These mineral and royalty interests include ownership in over 4,000 gross producing wells in 10 states. Such Contributing Parties, however, have no obligation to sell any assets to us or to accept any offer that we may make for such assets, and we may decide not to acquire such assets even if such Contributing Parties offer them to us. Please read “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence—Agreements and Transactions with Affiliates in Connection with our Initial Public Offering—Contribution Agreement.”
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Acquire additional mineral and royalty interests from third parties and leverage our relationships with our Sponsors and the Contributing Parties to grow our business. We intend to make opportunistic acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests that have substantial resource and organic growth potential and meet our acquisition criteria, which include (i) mineral and royalty interests in high‑quality producing acreage that enhance our asset base, (ii) significant amounts of recoverable oil and natural gas in place with geologic support for future production and reserve growth and (iii) a geographic footprint complementary to our diverse portfolio.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our Sponsors and their affiliates have extensive experience in identifying, evaluating and completing strategic acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests. In connection with the closing of our IPO, we entered into a management services agreement with Kimbell Operating, which entered into separate services agreements with certain entities controlled by affiliates of our Sponsors, pursuant to which they will identify, evaluate and recommend to us acquisition opportunities and negotiate the terms of such acquisitions. We believe that these individuals’ knowledge of the oil and natural gas industry, relationships within the industry and experience in identifying, evaluating and completing acquisitions will provide us opportunities to grow through strategic and accretive acquisitions that complement or expand our asset portfolio.
 We also may have opportunities to acquire mineral or royalty interests from third parties jointly with our Sponsors and the Contributing Parties. In connection with our IPO and pursuant to the contribution agreement that we entered into with our Sponsors and the Contributing Parties, we have a right to participate, at our option and on substantially the same or better terms, in up to 50% of any acquisitions, other than de minimis acquisitions, for which Messrs. R. Ravnaas, Taylor and Wynne provide, directly or indirectly, any oil and gas diligence, reserve engineering or other business services. We believe this arrangement will give us access 

 
  11

 
to third‑party acquisition opportunities we might not otherwise be in a position to pursue. Please read “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence—Agreements and Transactions with Affiliates in Connection with our Initial Public Offering—Contribution Agreement.”

· | Benefit from reserve, production and cash flow growth through organic production growth and development of our mineral and royalty interests to grow distributions. Our assets consist of diversified mineral and royalty interests. The majority of our assets, 73.5% of our well count and 46.5% of our gross acreage are from the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Terryville/Cotton Valley/Haynesville and the Bakken/Williston Basin, which are some of the most active areas in the country. Over the long term, we expect working interest owners will continue to develop our acreage through infill drilling, horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing, recompletions and secondary and tertiary recovery methods. As an owner of mineral and royalty interests, we are entitled to a portion of the revenues received from the production of oil, natural gas and associated NGLs from the acreage underlying our interests, net of post-production expenses and taxes. We are not obligated to fund drilling and completion costs, lease operating expenses or plugging and abandonment costs at the end of a well’s productive life. As such, we benefit from the continued development of the properties we own a mineral or royalty interest in without the need for investment of additional capital by us, which we expect to increase our distributions over time.

· | Maintain a conservative capital structure and prudently manage our business for the long term. We are committed to maintaining a conservative capital structure that will afford us the financial flexibility to execute our business strategies on an ongoing basis. The limited liability company agreement of our General Partner contains provisions that prohibit certain actions without a supermajority vote of at least 662/3% of the members of the General Partner’s Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors”). Among the actions requiring a supermajority vote are the incurrence of borrowings in excess of 2.5 times our Debt to EBITDAX Ratio for the preceding four quarters and the issuance of any partnership interests that rank senior in right of distributions or liquidation to our common units. Please read “The Partnership Agreement—Certain Provisions of the Agreement Governing our General Partner.” In connection with our IPO, we entered into a $50.0 million secured revolving credit facility with an accordion feature permitting aggregate commitments under the facility to be increased up to $100.0 million (subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the procurement of additional commitments from new or existing lenders). We believe that this liquidity, along with internally generated cash from operations and access to the public capital markets, will provide us with the financial flexibility to grow our production, reserves and cash generated from operations through strategic acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests and the continued development of our existing assets.

  Competitive Strengths
 We believe that the following competitive strengths will allow us to successfully execute our business strategies and achieve our primary business objective:

· | Significant diversified portfolio of mineral and royalty interests in mature producing basins and exposure to undeveloped opportunities. We have a diversified, low decline asset base with exposure to high-quality conventional and unconventional plays. As of December 31, 2017, we owned mineral and royalty interests in approximately 3.7 million gross acres and overriding royalty interests in approximately 2 million gross acres, with approximately 35% of our aggregate acres located in the Permian Basin and over 98% of the acreage subject to our mineral and royalty interests was leased to working interest owners (including 100% of our overriding royalty interests), and substantially all of those leases were held by production. The estimated proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves attributable to our interests in our underlying acreage were 20,954 MBoe (49.2% liquids, consisting of 72.4% oil and 27.6% NGLs) based on the reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott. Of these reserves, 73.1% were classified as PDP reserves, 0.4% were classified as PDNP reserves and 26.5% were classified as PUD reserves. PUD reserves included in this estimate are from 750 gross proved undeveloped locations. As of December 31, 2016, the estimated proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves attributable to our Predecessor’s interests in our underlying acreage were 2,311 MBoe (48.5% liquids, consisting of 79.0% oil and 21.0% NGLs) based on the reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott. Of these reserves, 58.9% were classified as PDP reserves, 1.5% were classified as PDNP reserves and 39.6% were classified as PUD reserves. PUD reserves included in this estimate are from 355 gross proved

undeveloped locations. The geographic breadth of our assets gives us exposure to potential production and reserves from new and existing plays without further required investment on our behalf. We believe that we will continue to benefit from these cost-free additions to production and reserves for the foreseeable future as a result of technological advances and continuing interest by third-party producers in development activities on our acreage.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Exposure to many of the leading resource plays in the United States. We expect the operators of our properties to continue to drill new wells and to complete drilled but uncompleted wells on our acreage, which we believe should substantially offset the natural production declines from our existing wells. We believe that our operators have significant drilling inventory remaining on the acreage underlying our mineral or royalty interest in multiple resource plays. Our mineral and royalty interests are located in 20 states and in nearly every major onshore basin across the continental United States and include ownership in over 50,000 gross producing wells, including over 30,000 wells in the Permian Basin.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Financial flexibility to fund expansion. We believe that our conservative capital structure will permit us to maintain financial flexibility to allow us to opportunistically purchase strategic mineral and royalty interests, subject to the supermajority vote provisions of the limited liability company agreement of our General Partner. In connection with our IPO, we entered into a $50.0 million secured revolving credit facility with an accordion feature permitting aggregate commitments under the facility to be increased up to $100.0 million (subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the procurement of additional commitments from new or existing lenders). As of December 31, 2017, we had $30.8 million outstanding under the facility. Please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Indebtedness—New Revolving Credit Agreement” for further information. We believe that we will be able to expand our asset base through acquisitions utilizing our credit facility, internally generated cash from operations and access to the public capital markets.

· | Experienced and proven management team with a track record of making acquisitions. The members of our management team and Board of Directors have an average of over 30 years of oil and gas experience. Our management team and Board of Directors, which includes our founders, have a long history of buying mineral and royalty interests in high‑quality producing acreage throughout the United States. Certain members of our management team have managed a significant investment program, investing in over 160 acquisitions. We believe we have a proven competitive advantage in our ability to source, engineer, evaluate, acquire and manage mineral and royalty interests in high‑quality producing acreage.

  Our Properties
 Material Basins and Producing Regions
 The following is an overview of the U.S. basins and producing regions we consider most material to our current and future business.

· | Permian Basin. The Permian Basin extends from southeastern New Mexico into west Texas and is currently one of the most active drilling regions in the United States. It includes three geologic provinces: the Midland Basin to the east, the Delaware Basin to the west, and the Central Basin in between. The Permian Basin consists of mature legacy onshore oil and liquids‑rich natural gas reservoirs and has been actively drilled over the past 90 years. The extensive operating history, favorable operating environment, mature infrastructure, long reserve life, multiple producing horizons, horizontal development potential and liquids‑rich reserves make the Permian Basin one of the most prolific oil‑producing regions in the United States. Our acreage underlies prospective areas for the Wolfcamp play in the Midland and Delaware Basins, the Spraberry formation in the Midland Basin, and the Bone Springs formation in the Delaware Basin, which are among the most active plays in the country.

· | Mid‑Continent. The Mid‑Continent is a broad area containing hundreds of fields in Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Nebraska and Texas and including the Granite Wash, Cleveland and the Mississippi Lime formations. The Anadarko Basin is a structural basin centered in the western part of
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  13

 

Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, extending into southwestern Kansas and southeastern Colorado. A key feature of the Anadarko Basin is the stacked geologic horizons including the Cana‑Woodford and Springer shale in the SCOOP and STACK.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Terryville/Cotton Valley/Haynesville. We own a substantial position in the core of the Terryville Field that the Contributing Parties acquired in 2007. Our mineral interests are leased and operated by Range Resources Corporation/Memorial Resource Development Corp. Producing since 1954, the Terryville Field is one of the most prolific natural gas fields in North America. Redevelopment of the field with horizontal drilling and modern completion techniques has resulted in high recoveries relative to drilling and completion costs, high initial production rates with high liquids yields, and long reserve life with multiple stacked producing zones.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Eagle Ford. The Eagle Ford shale formation stretches across south Texas and includes some of the most economic and productive areas in the United States. The Eagle Ford contains significant amounts of hydrocarbons and is considered the source rock, or the original source, for much of the oil and natural gas contained in the Austin Chalk Basin. The Eagle Ford shale formation has benefitted from improvements in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Barnett Shale/Fort Worth Basin. The Fort Worth Basin is a major petroleum producing geological system that is primarily located in north central Texas and southwestern Oklahoma. This area is best known for the Barnett Shale, which was one of the first shale plays to utilize horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing and is one of the most productive sources of shale gas along with the Marcellus and Haynesville Shales. In addition to the Barnett Shale, this area is also known for the Marble Falls, Mississippi Lime, Bend Conglomerate and Caddo plays.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Bakken/Williston Basin. The Williston Basin stretches through North Dakota, the northwest part of South Dakota, and eastern Montana and is best known for the Bakken/Three Forks shale formations. The Bakken ranks as one of the largest oil developments in the United States in the past 40 years. Development of the Bakken became commercial on a large scale over the past ten years with the advent of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | San Juan Basin. The San Juan Basin is located in the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States, stretching over 4,600 square miles and encompassing much of northwestern New Mexico, southwestern Colorado and parts of Arizona and Utah. Most gas production in the basin comes from the Fruitland Coalbed Methane Play, with the remainder derived from the Mesaverde and Dakota tight gas plays. The San Juan Basin is the most productive coalbed methane basin in North America.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Onshore California. The majority of our mineral and royalty interests in California are in the Ventura Basin. The Ventura Basin has been active since the early 1900s and is one of the largest oil fields in California. The Ventura Basin contains multiple stacked formations throughout its depths, and a considerable inventory of existing re‑development opportunities, as well as new play discovery potential.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | DJ Basin/Rockies/Niobrara. The Denver‑Julesburg Basin, also known as the DJ Basin, is a geologic basin centered in eastern Colorado stretching into southeast Wyoming, western Nebraska and western Kansas. The area includes the Wattenberg Gas Field, one of the largest natural gas deposits in the United States, and the Niobrara formation. The Niobrara includes three separate zones and stretches from the DJ Basin up into the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. Development in this area is currently focused on horizontal drilling in the Niobrara and Codell formations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Illinois Basin. The Illinois Basin extends across most of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and parts of Tennessee. The Illinois Basin is a mature area dominated by conventional oil production with some coalbed methane production. The Bridgeport, Cypress, Aux Vasses, Ste. Genevieve, Ullin, Fort Payne and New Albany are some of the formations with a current commercial focus in the Illinois Basin.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other. Our other assets are primarily located in the Western Gulf (onshore) Basin and the Louisiana‑Mississippi Salt Basins. The Western Gulf region ranges from South Texas through southeastern

 Proved Reserves
 Evaluation and Review of Estimated Proved Reserves
 Our and our Predecessor’s historical reserve estimates as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 were prepared by Ryder Scott, an independent petroleum engineering firm. Ryder Scott is a third-party engineering firm and does not own an interest in any of our properties and is not employed by us on a contingent basis.
 Within Ryder Scott, the technical person primarily responsible for preparing the reserve estimates set forth in the reserve report incorporated herein is Mr. Scott Wilson, who has been practicing petroleum-engineering consulting at Ryder Scott since 2000. Mr. Wilson is a registered Professional Engineer in the States of Alaska, Colorado, Texas and Wyoming. 

 
  16

 
He earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Petroleum Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines in 1983 and a Master of Business Administration in Finance from the University of Colorado in 1985. As technical principal, Mr. Wilson meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in applying industry standard practices to engineering evaluations as well as in applying U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines. A copy of Ryder Scott’s estimated proved reserve report as of December 31, 2017 is attached as an exhibit to this Annual Report.
 Our Chief Executive Officer, Robert D. Ravnaas, has agreed to provide us with reserve engineering services. Mr. R. Ravnaas is a petroleum engineer with over 30 years of reservoir and operations experience. Mr. R. Ravnaas and certain engineers and geoscience professionals under his supervision worked closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves relating to our mineral and royalty interests. Mr. R. Ravnaas met with our independent reserve engineers periodically during the period covered by the reserve report to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process. We provide historical information to the independent reserve engineers for our properties such as ownership interest, oil and gas production, well test data, commodity prices and operating and development costs. Operating and development costs are not realized to our interest but are used to calculate the economic limit life of the wells. These costs are estimated and checked by our independent reserve engineers.
 Mr. R. Ravnaas is primarily responsible for the preparation of our reserves. In addition, the preparation of our proved reserve estimates is completed in accordance with internal control procedures, including the following:

· | review and verification of historical production data, which data is based on actual production as reported by the operators of our properties;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation of reserve estimates by Mr. R. Ravnaas or under his direct supervision;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | review by Mr. R. Ravnaas of all of our reported proved reserves at the close of each quarter, including the review of all significant reserve changes and all new proved undeveloped reserves additions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | verification of property ownership by our land department; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | no employee’s compensation is tied to the amount of reserves booked.

  Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. If deterministic methods are used, the SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered.” All of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 were estimated using a deterministic method. The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under SEC rules. The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance‑based methods, (2) volumetric‑based methods and (3) analogy. These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves. The proved reserves for our properties were estimated by performance methods, analogy or a combination of both methods. All proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells were estimated by performance methods. These performance methods include, but may not be limited to, decline curve analysis, which utilized extrapolations of available historical production and pressure data. All proved developed non‑producing and undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method.
 To estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, Ryder Scott considered many factors and assumptions, including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and 

 
  17

 
engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and the SEC pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates. To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves included production and well test data, downhole completion information, geologic data, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, available seismic data and historical well cost and production cost data.
 Summary of Estimated Proved Reserves
 Estimates of reserves as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a field-by-field basis on the first day of each month within the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, in accordance with SEC guidelines applicable to reserve estimates as of the end of such period. The unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month prices were $51.34 and $42.75 per Bbl for oil and $2.98 and $2.49 per MMBtu for natural gas at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The price per Bbl for NGLs was modeled as a percentage of oil price, which was derived from historical accounting data. Reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage. The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual future production, cash flows, taxes, development expenditures, production costs and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates.
 The following table presents our and our Predecessor’s estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves:

(1) | Estimated proved reserves are presented on an oil-equivalent basis using a conversion of six Mcf per barrel of “oil equivalent.” This conversion is based on energy equivalence and not price or value equivalence. If a price equivalent conversion based on the twelve-month average prices for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was used, the conversion factor would be approximately 17.2 Mcf per Bbl of oil. In this Annual Report, we supplementally provide “value-equivalent” production information or volumes presented on an oil-equivalent basis using a conversion factor of 20 Mcf of natural gas per barrel of “oil equivalent,” which is the conversion factor we use in our business. We are providing this measure supplementally because we believe this conversion factor represents an estimation of value equivalence over time and better correlates with the respective contribution of oil and natural gas to our revenues. We use the 20-to-1 conversion factor as we assess our business, including analysis of our financial and production performance, strategic decisions to purchase additional properties and budgeting. We do not adjust the 20-to-1 ratio to reflect current pricing, because the significant volatility in the conversion ratio makes it difficult for us to compare results across periods. By reviewing our aggregate production on a constant 20-to-1 basis, which removes the variability of price fluctuations but generally approximates price equivalence over recent periods, we are able to compare production data from period to period as well as the relative contribution of oil and natural gas to our revenues. The 20-to-1 conversion factor approximates the mean ratio of the price of WTI oil to the price of Henry

Hub natural gas from January 3, 2006 to December 31, 2017, as reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”). During this period, the ratio of the price of oil to the price of natural gas ranged from 5.64 to 56.91. The mean ratios of the price of oil to the price of natural gas were 17.10 and 17.72 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Due to the variability of the prices of oil and natural gas, there is no standard conversion ratio for value equivalence, and the 20-to-1 ratio presented here may not accurately reflect the ratio of oil prices to natural gas prices for a given period.

  The foregoing reserves are all located within the continental United States. Reserve engineering is and must be recognized as a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. As a result, the estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, the results of drilling, testing, and production may justify revisions of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on several variables and assumptions, all of which may vary from actual results, including geologic interpretation, prices, and future production rates and costs. Please read “Risk Factors.”
 Additional information regarding our estimated proved reserves can be found in the reserve report as of December 31, 2017, which is included as an exhibit to this report.
 Estimated Proved Undeveloped Reserves
 As of December 31, 2017, our PUD reserves totaled 2,179 MBbls of oil, 16,416 MMcf of natural gas and 636 MBbls of NGLs, for a total of 5,552 MBoe. As of December 31, 2016, our PUD reserves totaled 2,331 MBbls of oil, 15,219 MMcf of natural gas and 566 MBbls of NGLs, for a total of 5,434 MBoe. PUD reserves will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production.
 As of December 31, 2016, our Predecessor’s PUD reserves totaled 404 MBbls of oil, 2,554 MMcf of natural gas and 85 MBbls of NGLs, for a total of 915 MBoe. PUD reserves were converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells began production.
 The following tables summarize our changes in PUD reserves (in MBoe):

 | Partnership | Predecessor 
 | December 31, 2017 | December 31, 2016 | December 31, 2016
Beginning balance | 5,434 | 5,224 | 892

Ending balance | 5,551 | 5,434 | 915 

          Our PUD reserves as of December 31, 2017 were from 402 vertical wells and 348 horizontal wells. As of December 31, 2017, all of our PUD drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled prior to December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 0.4% of our total proved reserves were classified as proved developed non-producing.
 Changes in PUDs that occurred from December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2017 were primarily due to:
    
· | the acquisition of an additional 606 MBoe through five diverse acquisition for approximately $29.3 million of royalty interests across ten states including Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Wyoming, California, North Dakota, Utah, New Mexico, Arkansas, and Kansas.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | additions of approximately 973 MBoe, as well locations were converted from probable to proved undeveloped, as offset drilling proved our acreage and projected drilling dates fell within five years of the effective date of the report.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the conversion of approximately 1,222 MBoe PUD reserves into proved developed reserves as 349 locations (143 horizontal and 206 vertical) were drilled; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | positive revisions of approximately 204 MBoe in PUDs primarily due to modifying PUD drill schedule timing to match current drilling rates and operator projections.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Of the 349 locations that were drilled in 2017, 109 locations were specifically identified by management in its 2016 reserve estimates. The remaining 240 locations were not specifically identified in managements proved undeveloped forecast, but were included in its reserve estimates as being scheduled to be drilled in 2017. These locations include infill drilling in multi‑well units and in some cases, waterflood response, CO2 response, well stimulations, flood conformance improvements and pump upgrades. Management’s forecasts for its multi‑well units are based on a multi‑factor analysis that includes reviewing information from state regulatory agencies and other third‑party sources, including publicly disclosed data by the operators, as well as management’s experience with the units.

  Drilling Results
 As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the operators of our properties had over 50,000 and 48,000 gross productive development wells, respectively, on the acreage underlying our mineral and royalty interests. As of December 31, 2016, our Predecessor owned mineral or royalty interests in over 13,000 productive wells. As a holder of mineral and royalty interests, we generally are not provided information as to whether any wells drilled on the properties underlying our acreage are classified as exploratory. We are not aware of any dry holes drilled on the acreage underlying our mineral and royalty interests during the relevant period.

 Competition
 The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive; we primarily compete with companies for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties some of whom have greater resources than we do. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Additionally, many of our competitors are, or are affiliated with, operators that engage in the exploration and production of their oil and gas properties, which allows them to acquire larger assets that include operated properties. Our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. These companies may also have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. Our ability to acquire additional properties in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties. Seasonal Nature of Business
 Generally, demand for oil and natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for the operators of our properties in meeting well drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations. Regulation
 The following disclosure describes regulation directly associated with operators of oil and natural gas properties, including our current operators, and other owners of working interests in oil and natural gas properties.
 Oil and natural gas operations are subject to various types of legislation, regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities. This legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business.
 Environmental Matters
 Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations have the potential to impact production on our properties, which could materially adversely affect our business and our prospects. Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non‑compliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive and other protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations. The strict, joint and several liability nature of such laws and regulations could impose liability upon the operators of our properties regardless of fault. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our business and prospects.

 
  22

 

 Non‑Hazardous and Hazardous Waste
 The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder, affect oil and natural gas exploration, development, and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non‑hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Administrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. Although most wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, these wastes typically constitute nonhazardous solid wastes that are subject to less stringent requirements. From time to time, the EPA and state regulatory agencies have considered the adoption of stricter disposal standards for nonhazardous wastes, including crude oil and natural gas wastes. Moreover, it is possible that some wastes generated in connection with exploration and production of oil and gas that are currently classified as nonhazardous may, in the future, be designated as “hazardous wastes,” resulting in the wastes being subject to more rigorous and costly management and disposal requirements. Pursuant to a Consent Decree with a coalition of environmental group that filed suit in May2016, EPA must review regulations governing the disposal of certain oil and natural gas drilling wastes under RCRA by March 2019 and either determine revisions to the exemption are not necessary or undertake rulemaking to be completed by July 2021. Any changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the operators of our properties’ capital expenditures and operating expenses, which in turn could affect production from the acreage underlying our mineral and royalty interests and adversely affect our business and prospects.

 The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”) and analogous state laws, generally impose strict, joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination, and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility. Under CERCLA and comparable state statutes, persons deemed “responsible parties” may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination), for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In addition, the risk of accidental spills or releases could expose the operators of the acreage underlying our mineral interests to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on the operators’ businesses, financial condition and results of operations. Liability for any contamination under these laws could require the operators of the acreage underlying our mineral interests to make significant expenditures to investigate and remediate such contamination or attain and maintain compliance with such laws and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. Water Discharges
 The federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (“Clean Water Act”), the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), the Oil Pollution Act (“OPA”), and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into regulated waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. The EPA has issued a final rule outlining its position on the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States, but this rule has been stayed nationwide by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals until ongoing litigation regarding the rule is settled. In January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision determining that only U.S. district courts have jurisdiction to hear challenges to that rule. As a result of that ruling, the Sixth Circuit stay is expected to be withdrawn, although stays issued by district courts in several states will remain in effect. Additionally, on February 28, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order directing the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to review and, consistent with applicable law, to initiate rulemaking to rescind or revise the rule. The 

 
  23

 
EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a notice of intent to review and rescind or revise the rule on March 6, 2017. In February 2018, the agencies also published a final rule adding a February 6, 2020 applicability date to the 2015 rule. The final rule adding this applicability date is currently subject to litigation.
 In addition, spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges, and in June 2016, the EPA finalized effluent limitation guidelines for the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing.
 The OPA is the primary federal law for oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into regulated waters, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs. The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict, joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil into surface waters.
 Noncompliance with the Clean Water Act or the OPA may result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive obligations, for the operators of the acreage underlying our mineral interests.
 Air Emissions
 The federal Clean Air Act, and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. The EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. For example, most recently in May 2016, the EPA finalized additional regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that established new emission control requirements for oil and natural gas production and processing operations, which is discussed in more detail below in “—Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing.” These laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for oil and natural gas producers and impact production of the acreage underlying our mineral and royalty interests, and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non‑compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Moreover, obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Climate Change
 In response to findings that emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), including carbon dioxide and methane, present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, require preconstruction and operating permits for certain large stationary sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHGs from certain onshore oil and natural gas production sources on an annual basis. As a result of this continued regulatory focus, future GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility.
 Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Although Congress has not adopted such legislation at this time, it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce GHG emissions. Additionally, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. Most recently in 2015, the United States participated in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Climate Agreement (the “Paris Agreement”). In April 2016, the United States was one of 175 countries to sign the Paris Agreement, which requires member countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set 

 
  24

 
GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. In June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement unless it is renegotiated. The State Department informed the United Nations of the United States’ withdrawal in August 2017. Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, the earliest possible effective withdrawal date is November 2020.
 Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry, and state and local climate change initiatives and, at this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business.
 In addition, one potential consequence of climate change could be increased severity of extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornados and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with production and increase costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our business.
 Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing
 Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and natural gas regulatory programs. However, on May 9, 2014, the EPA announced an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act, relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and natural gas exploration or production. Further, in March 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) adopted a rule requiring, among other things, public disclosure to the BLM of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations after fracturing operations have been completed and would strengthen standards for wellbore integrity and management of fluids that return to the surface during and after fracturing operations on federal and Indian lands. That rule was rescinded in December 2017. In addition, legislation has been introduced before Congress that would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and would require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. If enacted, these or similar bills could result in additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations. These permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites and increased costs to make wells productive.
 On August 16, 2012, the EPA approved final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, the EPA’s rule package includes New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. The final rule seeks to achieve a 95% reduction in VOCs emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulically‑fractured natural gas wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. In May 2016, the EPA finalized similar rules that impose VOC emissions limits on certain oil and natural gas operations that were previously unregulated, including hydraulically fractured oil wells, as well as methane emissions limits for certain new or modified oil and natural gas emissions sources. The EPA is currently reconsidering the rules and has proposed to stay their requirements. However, the rules currently remain in effect.
 In addition, governments have studied the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, in December 2016, the EPA issued its final report on a study it had conducted over several years regarding the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water sources. The final report, contrary to several previously published draft reports issued by the EPA, found instances in which impacts to drinking water may occur, including situations involving large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells. However, the report also noted significant data gaps that prevented the EPA from determining the extent or severity of these impacts. The U.S. Department of Energy has conducted an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic‑fracturing completion methods. Additionally, certain members of Congress have called upon the U.S. Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources, the 

 
  25

 
SEC to investigate the natural‑gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shale formations by means of hydraulic fracturing, and the EIA to provide a better understanding of that agency’s estimates regarding natural gas reserves, including reserves from shale formations, as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates. These studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and whether any meaningful results are obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory authorities.
 Several states have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. For example, the Texas Legislature adopted legislation requiring oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process, effective as of September 1, 2011. Further, in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission issued a “well integrity rule,” which updates the requirements for drilling, putting pipe down, and cementing wells. The rule also includes new testing and reporting requirements, such as: (i) the requirement to submit cementing reports after well completion or after cessation of drilling, whichever is later; and (ii) the imposition of additional testing on wells less than 1,000 feet below usable groundwater. The well integrity rule took effect in January 2014. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular.
 There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the hydraulic fracturing related activities, particularly the disposal of produced water in underground injection wells, and the increased occurrence of seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In some instances, operators of injection wells in the vicinity of seismic events have been ordered to reduce injection volumes or suspend operations. Some state regulatory agencies, including those in Colorado, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas, have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. For example, following earthquakes in and around Cushing, Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission announced plans on November 7, 2016, to shut down or reduce the volume of disposal at certain injection wells that discharge into the Arbuckle formation. Regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. In March 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas, where many of our properties are located. In March 2017, the United States Geological Survey produced an updated seismic hazard survey that forecasted lower earthquake rates in regions of induced activity, but still showed significantly elevated hazards in the central and eastern United States. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed, most recently in Oklahoma, alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells and hydraulic fracturing. Such regulations and restrictions could cause delays and impose additional costs and restrictions on the operators of our properties and on their waste disposal activities.
 If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing and related activities are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal or state level, fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative changes could cause operators to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by operators could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing.

 Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
 The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.
 The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas. The interstate transportation of oil and natural gas and the sale for resale of natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation. FERC’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas.
 Although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations. Sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at market prices.
 Drilling and Production
 The operations of the operators of our properties are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local level. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The state, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following:
· | the location of wells;
--+-----------------------


· | the method of drilling and casing wells;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | the timing of construction or drilling activities, including seasonal wildlife closures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the rates of production or “allowables”;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the plugging and abandoning of wells; and
--+------------------------------------------


· | notice to, and consultation with, surface owners and other third parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas that the operators of our properties can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which operators can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells, negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations operators can drill.

 
  27

 

 Federal, state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells, closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where the operators of our properties operate. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment, decommissioning and site restoration. Although the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers does not require bonds or other financial assurances, some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements.
 Natural Gas Sales and Transportation
 FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Since 1978, various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and non‑price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in “first sales.”
 Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties. FERC also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which the operators of our properties may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity, as well as the revenues the operators of our properties receive for sales of natural gas and release of natural gas pipeline capacity. Interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers, marketers and other shippers, regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company. FERC’s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive, open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from third party sellers other than pipelines.
 Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC under the NGA. Although its policy is still in flux, FERC has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non‑jurisdictional gathering facilities, which may increase the operators’ costs of transporting gas to point‑of‑sale locations. This may, in turn, affect the costs of marketing natural gas that the operators of our properties produce.
 Historically, the natural gas industry has been very heavily regulated; therefore, we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by FERC and Congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect, if any, future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities.
 Oil Sales and Transportation
 Sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
 Crude oil sales are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act and intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors.
 Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non‑discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that our access to oil pipeline transportation services will not materially differ from our competitors’ access to oil pipeline transportation services.

 State Regulation
 Texas regulates the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. Texas currently imposes a 4.6% severance tax on the market value of oil production and a 7.5% severance tax on the market value of natural gas production. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources.
 States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. Should direct economic regulation or regulation of wellhead prices by the states increase, this could limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and the number of wells or locations the operators of our properties can drill.
 The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Title to Properties
 We believe that the title to our assets is satisfactory in all material respects. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests and contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for current taxes and other burdens, easements, restrictions, and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens, and encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties. Under our revolving credit facility, we have granted the lenders a lien on substantially all of the mineral and royalty interests of our wholly owned subsidiaries. Employees
 The officers of our General Partner manage our operations and activities. However, neither we, our General Partner nor our subsidiaries have employees. In connection with the closing of our IPO, we entered into a management services agreement with Kimbell Operating, which entered into separate services agreements with certain entities controlled by affiliates of our Sponsors and Mr. Duncan, pursuant to which they and Kimbell Operating provide management, administrative and operational services for us, including the operation of our properties. Please read “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” and “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence” As of December 31, 2017, Kimbell Operating has approximately 14 employees performing services for our operations and activities.
