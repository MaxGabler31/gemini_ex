Company Overview   
 
Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative Central Nervous System (“CNS”) adult stem cell therapies designed to address the significant unmet medical needs of patients with debilitating neurodegenerative diseases. Utilizing our proprietary mesenchymal stem cell platform technology, NurOwn®, Brainstorm is advancing therapies to treat a broad range of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (“ALS”), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease), Multiple Sclerosis (“MS”), and Parkinson’s disease (“PD”), which currently have limited or no treatment options.
2017 and Recent Highlights
 

· | The Company made significant progress in 2017, advancing NurOwn®, our late stage differentiated mesenchymal stem cell therapy, into a Phase 3 trial for the treatment of ALS. Enrollment in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose clinical trial of NurOwn® for ALS is now ongoing. This Phase 3 trial builds upon the promising efficacy seen in prior trials including our randomized Phase 2 trial conducted in the U.S.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We received a non-dilutive $16 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (“CIRM”) and a grant of approximately $2.1 million from the Israel Innovation Authority (“IIA”) in support of NurOwn® and the Phase 3 study of NurOwn® in ALS.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We enhanced our manufacturing capabilities in 2017 by completing a validation of the cryopreservation process for the long-term storage of mesenchymal stem cells (“MSC”). Cryopreservation allows us to provide repeated doses of NurOwn® from a single bone marrow aspirate, avoiding the need for patients to undergo repeated bone marrow aspirations, and moving us closer to our goal of providing best-in-class therapies designed to extend and improve the quality of life in patients with neurodegenerative disorders.

Our Proprietary Technology
 
Our NurOwn® technology is based on a novel differentiation protocol, which induces the differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, into neuro-protective and immunomodulatory, cells (“MSC-NTF” cells) capable of releasing multiple neurotrophic factors. These factors are known to be critical for the growth, survival and differentiation of neurons, they include: glial-derived neurotrophic factor (“GDNF”); brain-derived neurotrophic factor (“BDNF”); vascular endothelial growth factor (“VEGF”); and hepatocyte growth factor (“HGF”). GDNF is one of the most potent survival factors known for peripheral neurons. VEGF and HGF have been demonstrated to have important neuro-protective effects in ALS and in other neurodegenerative diseases. 
 
Our approach to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases with autologous adult stem cells includes a multi-step process beginning with harvesting of undifferentiated stem cells from the patient's own bone marrow, and includes an Intrathecal (“IT”) injection of differentiated, neurotrophic factor-secreting mesenchymal stem cells into the same patient. The MSC-NTF cells are transplanted by intrathecal transplantation; into the cerebrospinal fluid by standard lumbar puncture. This procedure does not require hospitalization and has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in multiple CNS clinical trials to date.
 
Our proprietary technology and manufacturing processing of MSC-NTF cells for clinical use is conducted in full compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”).
 
Our proprietary technology is fully licensed to and developed by Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Ltd., our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Israeli Subsidiary”).

The NurOwn® Transplantation Process
 

· | Bone marrow aspiration from patient; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Isolation and propagation of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC); 
· | Cryopreservation of MSC; 
· | Thawing and differentiation of the MSC into neurotrophic-factor secreting (MSC-NTF; NurOwn®) cells; and
· | Autologous transplantation into the patient’s cerebrospinal fluid by IT injection (lumbar puncture). 

Differentiation before Transplantation
 
The ability to induce differentiation of autologous adult mesenchymal stem cells into MSC-NTF cells before transplantation is unique to NurOwn®, making it the first-of-its-kind for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
 
The specialized cells secrete neurotrophic factors that may lead to:
 

· | Protection of existing motor neurons; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------
· | Promotion of motor neuron growth; and 
· | Re-establishment of functional nerve-muscle interaction.

Autologous (Self-transplantation)
 
The NurOwn® approach is autologous, or self-transplanted, using the patient’s own bone-marrow derived stem cells. In autologous transplantation, there is no risk of rejection and no need for treatment with immunosuppressive agents, which can cause severe and/or long-term side effects. In addition, the use of adult stem cells is free of ethical controversies associated with the use of embryonic stem cells in some countries.
The ALS Program 
 
NurOwn® is currently in late stage clinical development for the treatment of ALS. It has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for this indication, and has been granted Orphan Status in both the United States and in Europe. We have completed two early stage clinical trials of NurOwn® in patients with ALS at the Hadassah Medical Center (“Hadassah”) in Jerusalem as well as a Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical study at three prestigious US Medical centers, all highly experienced in the management and investigation of ALS.
 
Phase 1/2 open label trials
 
The first two open-label studies were approved by the Israeli Ministry of Health (“MoH”) and the U.S. study was conducted under an FDA Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application. The first-in-human study, a Phase 1/2 safety and efficacy study of NurOwn® administered either intramuscularly or intrathecally in 12 ALS patients, was initiated in June 2011. This study demonstrated the safety of NurOwn® by both routes of administration, as well as signs of efficacy on both the ALS Functional Rating Score (“ALSFRS-R”), the industry gold standard, and a well-established measure, for evaluating the functional status of patients with a ALS, and Forced Vital Capacity (“FVC”), a measure of pulmonary function.
 
In January 2016, results of the two completed open label studies were published in JAMA Neurology. The publication presented the outcome of the Phase 1/2 study and Phase 2 dose escalation study with NurOwn® in ALS patients. The data provided indication of clinically meaningful benefit as reflected by a slower rate of disease progression in the period post treatment, as well as a positive trend on the rate of decline of muscle volume and on the compound motor axon potential (“CMAPs”). These were the first published clinical data using autologous mesenchymal stem cells, induced under culture conditions, to produce NTFs, with the potential to achieve a neuroprotective effect in ALS and modify the course of this disease.
 
Phase 2 Randomized Trial
 
The FDA-approved, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multi-center U.S. Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating NurOwn® in ALS patients was conducted at three leading medical centers (i) Massachusetts General Hospital (Harvard Medical School) in Boston, Massachusetts, (ii) University of Massachusetts Memorial Hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts, and (iii) Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. For this study, NurOwn® was manufactured at the Connell and O’Reilly Cell Manipulation Core Facility at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and at the Human Cellular Therapy Lab at the Mayo Clinic. In this study 48 patients were randomized 3:1 to receive NurOwn® or placebo.

Topline data from this Phase 2 Study were announced by the Company in July 2016. Further details were presented by investigators Dr. Robert Brown and Dr. James Berry, at the 15th Annual Meeting of the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) in October 2016 and by Dr. Berry at the 27th International Symposium on ALS/MND, in Dublin, Ireland, in December 2016. Key findings from the trial were as follows:
 

· | The study achieved its primary objective, demonstrating that NurOwn® transplantation was safe and well tolerated. There were no discontinuations from the trial due to AEs and there were no deaths in the study. The most common adverse events (of mild or moderate severity), were transient procedure-related such as headache, back pain, pyrexia arthralgia and injection-site discomfort, these were more commonly seen in the NurOwn-Treated participant compared to placebo.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NurOwn® also achieved multiple secondary efficacy endpoints, showing evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit. Notably, response rates were higher in NurOwn®-treated® subjects, compared to placebo, at all time points in the study out to 24 weeks.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pre-specified responder analyses examined percentage improvements in post treatment of ALSFRS-R slope compared to pre-treatment slope. These analyses showed that, in the NurOwn® treated group, a greater proportion of treated patients achieved 100% improvement in the post-treatment vs. pre-treatment slope, compared with the placebo group. In addition, a greater proportion of NurOwn® treated patients achieved a 1.5 point/month improvement in the post-treatment vs. pre-treatment ALSFRS-R slope, compared with the placebo group.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In summary, NurOwn® responders experienced a halt in disease progression or improvement, as measured by the post-treatment vs. pre-treatment ALSFRS-R slope change. Moreover, in the pre-specified subgroup that was defined to exclude subjects whose disease was progressing more slowly, this effect was even more pronounced. These are novel observations, that have not been seen in prior ALS clinical studies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | As an important confirmation of the biology of NurOwn®, levels of neurotrophic factors and inflammatory markers were measured in the cerebral-spinal fluid (“CSF”) samples collected from patients. In the samples of those patients treated with NurOwn®, statistically significant increases in levels of neurotrophic factors VEGF, HGF and LIF and a statistically significant reduction in inflammatory markers MCP-1, SDF-1 and CHIT-1 was observed post-transplantation. Furthermore, the observed reduction in inflammatory markers correlated with clinical outcomes. These results were not seen in placebo treated patients, consistent with the biological action of NurOwn.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Phase 2 study strongly suggests that repeat dosing and evaluation of ALS rapid progressors would optimize the probability of success in a phase 3 program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 3 Trial
 
The Company completed a successful End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and reached a general agreement to proceed to a Phase 3 trial. Importantly, the FDA accepted the key elements of the Phase 3 program (a multi-dose double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial protocol) to support a Biologic License Application (“BLA”) for NurOwn® in ALS. The trial is enrolling a patient population based on a Phase-II pre-specified sub-group of rapid progressors, which demonstrated superior outcomes. The primary clinical efficacy outcome measure is the ALSFR-S score responder analysis, a score that measures a patient's ability to perform tasks that are directly affected by ALS. The Phase 3 trial will also expand upon Phase 2 biomarker evaluations to further understand their potential to predict ALS disease progression and treatment response as well as confirm the biology of NurOwn® in a larger study population. The study will be conducted at six leading US Medical centers, three of which participated in the prior Phase 2 study. Patient enrollment commenced in October 2017 at Massachusetts General Hospital followed by the other 5 study sites, including University of California Irvine Medical Center, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, and Cedar Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Interim safety data are expected in mid-2018 and top-line data in late 2019. The study is registered www.clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier NCT03280056).
 
The Company has developed a cryopreservation process for the long-term storage of MSC, that will allow multiple doses of autologous NurOwn® to be created from a single bone marrow aspirate in the multi-dose clinical trial and avoid the need for patients to undergo repeated bone marrow aspirations. A validation study was conducted in 2017 comparing NurOwn®, MSC-NTF cells, derived from fresh mesenchymal stem cells to those derived from cryopreserved MSC. Company scientists were successful in showing that the MSC can be stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen for prolonged periods of time, while maintaining their characteristics. The cryopreserved MSC are capable of differentiating into NurOwn®, similar to the NurOwn® derived from fresh MSC of the same patient/donor, prior to cryopreservation.

The Company has contracted with City of Hope's Center for Biomedicine and Genetics to produce clinical supplies of NurOwn® adult stem cells for the ongoing Phase 3 clinical study. City of Hope is currently supporting the production for the patients treated in the Phase 3 trial.
 
The Company collaborated with the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital), and jointly applied in the Israel Hospital Exemption regulatory pathway, which was adopted by the MoH from the European Union regulation, for NurOwn® treatment of ALS. This pathway will enable the Company to make NurOwn® potentially accessible for ALS patients for a fee. 
 
Non-Dilutive Funding 
 
In June 2017, the Company announced that for the tenth consecutive year its Israeli Subsidiary, was awarded a new grant from Israel Innovative Authority in the amount of $2,100,000. The Israel Innovative Authority is part of the Ministry of Economy Program to support innovative technologies in Israel. The funds supported the initial development of the NurOwn® Phase 3 clinical program in ALS.
 
In July 2017, the Company was granted an award in the amount of $15,912,000 from the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) to support the pivotal Phase 3 study of NurOwn®, for the treatment of ALS. The award provided for a $5,250,000 project initial payment, which was received during the third quarter of 2017, and up to $15,912,000 in future milestone payments (inclusive of the project initial payment). The award does not bear a royalty payment commitment, nor is the award otherwise refundable.
 
Research and Development 
 
In addition to advancing its lead clinical program in ALS, the Company is leveraging th biology and clinical experience to explore additional indication including Parkinson’s disease and progressive multiple sclerosis. A study profiling NurOwn®'s unique miRNA signature was recently published in Stem Cell Research & Therapy. The publication entitled "miRNA profiling of NurOwn®: mesenchymal stem cells secreting neurotrophic factors" shows that NurOwn® MSC-NTF cells induced to secrete neurotrophic factors have both an enhanced secretion of NTFs as well as a distinct miRNA expression profile that distinguishes them from their MSCs of origin. miRNAs have shown to play critical roles in neuronal and glial cell biological processes. These findings may form the basis for the development of sensitive identity release assays for clinical trials, in vivo cell identification assays, and to elucidate MSC-NTF cells' mechanism of action in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases.
 
In addition, the Company is engaged in several research initiatives to improve and upscale NurOwn®’s manufacturing capabilities and capacity.
 
We have developed a cryopreservation process that enables the preservation of expended MSCs prior to the final differentiation process. This enables a single bone marrow aspiration to provide sufficient cell quantities for multiple dosing up to 3 years. We are using this process in our Phase 3 clinical trial. In addition, we are further developing a proprietary method to cryopreserve the final differentiated cell product, which will enable us to provide ready-for-injection therapeutic cell doses of NurOwn® that will create a stem cell bank for each patient, for ongoing, repeated treatments.

Company Business Strategy 
 
Our business strategy is to develop and commercialize NurOwn® as a treatment for one or more neurodegenerative diseases. To this end, our efforts are currently directed to several areas in research, development and manufacturing. The ALS program represents our last stage development phase of our lead indication, hence much of the Company’s resources are focused on this program. We are leveraging our strong existing pre-clinical data, initiating to advance new pre-clinical programs and engaging with scientific and regulatory experts to pursue the most attractive clinical and business opportunities. Important tasks include the execution of the ongoing US randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 3 study. The Company is actively engaged in several ongoing development projects with the goal of increasing the scale and efficiency of NurOwn® manufacturing. Our current strategy is to fully execute the Phase 3 Clinical Trial and if successful submit a BLA for NurOwn® in ALS. We may also choose to seek a strategic partnership with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company for the global commercialization of NurOwn® for ALS, or to support the execution of additional registration-enabling clinical programs in other neurodegenerative disease.
  
NurOwn Stem Cell Therapy in CNS Diseases
 
We are strategically focused on fully executing the late stage development of NurOwn® in ALS and actively exploring its application in other CNS disorders based on a broad preclinical experience in ALS, Parkinson’s Disease, Huntington’s Disease, MS and Autism.  NurOwn® cells are derived from non-specialized mesenchymal stem cells which have a potential for both self-renewal and differentiation into cell types with a specialized function, such as muscle, blood or brain cells. The cells can undergo asymmetric division, such that one of the two daughter cells retain the properties of the stem cell, while the other begins to differentiate into a more specialized cell type. Stem cells are therefore central to normal human growth and development, and are a potential source of new cells for the regeneration of diseased and damaged tissue. Stem cell therapy aims to restore diseased tissue function by the replacement and/or addition of healthy cells by stem cell transplants.
 
Mesenchymal stem cells can be easily obtained from adult tissues and used for both autologous (cells administered back to the same person from whom they were harvested) and allogeneic (cells administered to a person different than the person from whom the cells were harvested) approaches. MSCs are “multipotent” cells that can produce more than one type of specialized cell of the body, such as bone, fat, cartilage, and other types of cells. They secrete factors that promote tissue repair, and decrease inflammatory and immune reactions. The bone marrow is an invaluable source of MSCs and can be accessed through a simple aspiration procedure. We believe that human MSCs, which are capable of in vitro growth and expansion and multipotent differentiation, are a preferable source of therapeutic stem cells.  Furthermore, the differentiation of MSC into neuronal lineage is a critically important attribute in the application of MSC-based cell therapies in neurodegenerative disease for both safety and efficacy reasons.
 
Studies of neurodegenerative diseases suggest that symptoms and functional impairments that arise in afflicted individuals are secondary to defects in neuron cell function and the associated neural circuitry. To date, systemic drug delivery approaches have not been effective in the treatment of these diseases, possibly due to the blood-brain-barrier (“BBB”) limiting access and the ensuing lack of effective central nervous system (CNS) target engagement. Consequently, alternative approaches for treating neurodegenerative diseases have been attempted, such as transplantation of cells capable of replacing or supplementing the function of damaged neurons at the site of damage. For such cell replacement therapy to work, implanted cells must survive and integrate, both functionally and structurally, within the damaged tissue.  The application of NurOwn® in neurodegenerative disease is based on the capacity of the cells to deliver disease-relevant biologically active molecules, such as neurotrophic factors, at or near to the site of tissue injury, following intrathecal administration.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
 
ALS, often referred to as “Lou Gehrig's disease,” is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects motor nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS patients lead to progressive weakness, respiratory failure and eventually, death. The median survival for ALS patients is between 2 and 5 years from the onset of symptoms. Across the world, the prevalence of ALS is approximately 4-7 per 100,000. It is estimated that as many as 30,000 Americans have the disease at any given time, with about 51,000 afflicted in the territory of the European Single Market. Estimated annual treatment costs for advanced stage patients can be as high as $100,000-$200,000 per annum.
 
Treatment decisions are typically determined by the patient's symptoms, preferences and the stage of the disease. Approved disease modifying medications include:
 

· | Riluzole –approved by the FDA to treat ALS. Riluzole extends the time to death or ventilation by several months; however, it has not been shown to improve the daily functioning of ALS patients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Radicava (Edaravone) – a free radical scavenger- recently approved by FDA (May 2017) based on a single Phase 3 study carried out in Japan. 

 
Other symptomatic medications may be prescribed to help reduce symptoms such as fatigue, pain, sleep disturbances, constipation, and excess saliva and phlegm.
 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
 
MS is a chronic neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorder that affects the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord. Nerve cells are normally insulated with a protective layer called myelin, which enables nerve signals to travel properly. In MS, the myelin is destroyed (demyelination), causing loss of function of the nerve cells and disrupting transmission of brain messages to various parts of the body. While generally thought to be an autoimmune disease, the exact cause of MS is unknown.
 
MS can cause blurred vision, slurred speech, tremors, numbness, extreme fatigue, and problems with memory and concentration. Most MS patients experience muscle weakness in their extremities and difficulty with coordination and balance. These symptoms may be severe enough to impair walking or even standing. In the worst cases, MS can produce partial or complete paralysis. Most commonly, the course of MS waxes and wanes (“relapsing-remitting MS”), with progressive forms of the disease somewhat less common.
 
There are currently over 2.5 million people with MS worldwide, with roughly 800,000 of these patients located in the U.S. and Europe. Over 10,000 new cases are diagnosed annually in the U.S., mostly affecting women between the ages of 20 and 50. Annual drug treatment costs for MS can be as much as $80,000 a year per patient.
 
Treatment of MS focuses on symptom management, treatment of attacks, and prevention of future attacks. There are few treatments that modify disease progression in the absence of ongoing inflammatory activity. There are a variety of disease-modifying treatments FDA-approved for relapsing-remitting MS; however, patients with progressive forms of MS have an unmet need that remains to be addressed by currently available DMTs.
 
Parkinson’s Disease (PD)
 
PD is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which dopamine-producing neurons residing in the Substantia Nigra region of the brain undergo degeneration and eventually die, resulting in progressive impairment in movement and gait and may be associated with dementia. The cause of the disease is presently unknown.
 
Over 7 million people worldwide suffer from PD, of whom about one million are in the United States. Most people are diagnosed with the disease between the ages of 55 and 65 and about 85% of people with PD are over the age of 65. Prevalence of PD is increasing in line with the general aging of the population. The total economic burden of the disease has been estimated by the National Parkinson Foundation to exceed $14 billion annually in the U.S. alone.
 
Treatment of PD primarily comprises dopamine replacement, either directly (Levodopa), with dopamine mimetics or by inhibition of its breakdown. These treatments focus on treating the symptoms of the disease and are not a cure for PD. Levodopa has a propensity to cause serious motor response complications with long-term use such as on-off phenomenon, motor fluctuations and involuntary movements. Moreover, effective drug dosage often requires gradual increase, leading to more adverse side effects and eventual resistance to its therapeutic action. This greatly limits patient benefit. Therefore, physicians and researchers have sought Levodopa-sparing strategies in patients with early-stage disease to delay the need for Levodopa.

PD is also treated by Deep Brain Stimulation (“DBS”), which consists of implanting electrodes deep into the brain to provide permanent electrical stimulation to specific areas of the brain and to cause a delay in the activity in those areas. However, DBS is problematic as it may be associated with significant treatment morbidity such as bleeding in the brain, infection and depression. In addition, similar to drug therapy, DBS focuses on treating the symptoms of PD and does not provide a cure.
 
There is a great unmet need for novel approaches towards management of PD, primarily to control Levodopa-induced adverse side effects and motor fluctuations, and potentially to delay the onset of disease-related dementia.
 
In addition to the symptomatic drug development approaches, there is an intense effort to develop cell and gene therapeutic “curative” approaches to restore the neural function in patients with PD, by (i) replacing the dysfunctional cells with dopamine producing cell transplant, or by (ii) providing growth factors and proteins, such as GDNF, that can maintain or preserve the patient’s remaining dopaminergic cells, protecting them from further degeneration.

Trademarks:
 
NurOwn® is a registered trademark (application no. 85154891, filed October 18, 2010) for use in connection with “compositions of cells derived from stem cells for medical purposes; stem cells for medical purposes.” US Trademark No. 4641441 for NurOwn® was registered on November 18, 2014.
 
The patent applications, as well as relevant know-how and research results are licensed from Ramot. We intend to work with Ramot to protect and enhance our mutual intellectual property rights by filing continuations and divisional patent applications. New discoveries arising in the course of research and development within the Company were and will be patented by us independently.
 
Research and License Agreement with Ramot 
 
The Company has maintained a commercial relationship with Ramot, the technology transfer group within Tel Aviv University, since July 2004, when the Company and Ramot entered into a Research and License Agreement (the “Original Agreement”).   The Original Agreement was amended in both March and May of 2006, when the parties signed, respectively, an Amended and Restated Research and License Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Agreement”) and Amendment Number 1 to the Amended and Restated Agreement. Thereafter, the Company and Ramot entered into a Letter Agreement in December 2009 which further amended the Amended and Restated Agreement by releasing the Company from various duties and obligations (including the Company’s commitment to fund three (3) years of additional Ramot research - a financial commitment of $1,140,000), while converting other payments due and owing to Ramot by the Company into shares of Common Stock.  In December 2011, the Company assigned the Amended and Restated Agreement (as amended) to its Israeli Subsidiary with the consent of Ramot, provided the Company agreed to guaranty the performance obligations of its Israeli Subsidiary thereunder.  The Amended and Restated Agreement was amended in both April 2014 (Amendment Number 2) and March 2016 (Amendment Number 3).
 
In addition to the foregoing, on April 30, 2014, the Israeli Subsidiary executed a consulting agreement (the “Offen Consulting Agreement”) with Professor Offen of Tel Aviv University, which expressly replaced their previous agreement (signed in July 2004). Pursuant to the Offen Consulting Agreement, Professor Offen granted our Israeli Subsidiary exclusive rights, title and interest in and to all work product and deliverables resulting from the provision of his services thereunder, except that any new intellectual property arising from this agreement would be deemed a joint invention that is jointly owned by both our Israeli Subsidiary and Ramot. To date, no such joint inventions have resulted from this consulting agreement.  The Offen Consulting Agreement was terminated on January 18, 2018.

The primary focus of our agreements (and subsequent amendments) with Ramot has and continues to be the commissioning of a group of scientists within Tel Aviv University to carry out research in the area of the stem-cell technology referenced above, and the granting of rights to the Company (and later our Israeli Subsidiary, after the assignment referenced above) in the inventions, know-how and results procured from such research (the “Ramot IP”). 
 
In consideration for the rights granted to our Israeli Subsidiary in and to the Ramot IP, our Israeli Subsidiary is required to pay Ramot royalties ranging between three percent (3%) and five percent (5%) of all net sales realized from the exploitation of the Ramot IP, as well as remittances of between twenty percent (20%) and twenty-five percent (25%) on revenues received from the sub-licensing of the Ramot IP.
 
Pursuant to the third amendment of the Amended and Restated Agreement referenced above, Ramot agreed to convert the exclusive licenses then-existing, to outright transfers and assignments of the Ramot IP, thereby granting our Israeli Subsidiary ownership thereof.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Once fully developed, we intend to market our bone marrow derived differentiated neurotrophic-factor secreting cell products, NurOwn®, for autologous transplantation in patients by neurosurgeons in medical facilities in the U.S., Europe, Japan and the Pacific Rim.
 
In January 2013, the EMA Committee for Advanced Therapies designated NurOwn® as an Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product.
 
U.S. Drug Development Process 
 
The FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Biologics are subject to regulation by the FDA under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and related regulations and other federal, state and local laws and regulations. Biological products include a wide variety of products including vaccines, blood and blood components, gene therapies, tissue and proteins. Unlike most prescription products made through chemical processes, biological products generally are made from human and/or animal materials. To be lawfully marketed in interstate commerce, a biologic product must be the subject of a Biological License Application (“BLA”), issued by the FDA on the basis of a demonstration that the product is safe, pure and potent, and that the facility in which the product is manufactured meets standards to assure that it continues to be safe, pure and potent. The FDA has developed and is continuously updating the requirements with respect to cell and gene therapy products and has issued documents concerning the regulation of cellular and tissue-based products. Manufacturers of cell and tissue-based products must comply with the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or cGTP, which are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of such products. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease.
 
The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, product detention, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a biological product or drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

· | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices or other regulations; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
· | Performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product or drug for its intended use;
· | Submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, for a new drug; or a biologic license application for a new biological product; 


12
--


· | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | FDA review and approval of the BLA or NDA. 

 
The testing and approval process require substantial time, effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our stem cell therapies will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

· | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients having the specific disease.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Phase 2. Phase 2 trials involve investigations in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and the optimal dosage and schedule. 
· | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling. 

 
Post-approval studies, also called Phase 4 trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approvals. These studies are used to obtain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as part of the approval process.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected side effects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the stem cell therapy has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the stem cell therapy and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the stem cell therapy does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the stem cell therapy, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees which may be waived under certain limited circumstances.
 
The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve a BLA or NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s or biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA or NDA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.

Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a stem cell therapy intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a stem cell therapy available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. However, orphan product designation does provide the potential for a period of exclusivity and we may be eligible for grant funding of up to $400,000 per year for four years to defray costs of clinical trial expenses, tax credits for clinical research expenses and potential exemption from the FDA application user fee.
 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same stem cell therapy for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as (i) the drug’s orphan designation is revoked; (ii) its marketing approval is withdrawn; (iii) the orphan exclusivity holder consents to the approval of another applicant’s product; (iv) the orphan exclusivity holder is unable to assure the availability of a sufficient quantity of drug; or (v) a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by a competitor product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same stem cell therapy as defined by the FDA or if our stem cell therapy is determined to be contained within the competitor's product for the same indication or disease. If a stem cell therapy designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar but not identical benefits in the European Union.
 
In February 2011, we received Orphan Drug Designation for NurOwn® for the treatment of ALS in the United States. In July 2013, we received Orphan Medicinal Product Designation for NurOwn® for the treatment of ALS from the European Commission. Orphan designation grants a 10-year marketing exclusivity in the EU for the designated indication, as well as several other regulatory incentives.
 
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our stem cell therapies, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between (a) the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA or an NDA plus (b) the time between the submission date of a BLA or an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved stem cell therapy is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within 60 days of approval of the stem cell therapy. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Any drugs for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects with the product, reporting of changes in distributed products which would require field alert reports (“FARs”) for drugs and biological product deviation reports (“BPDRs”), providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. In September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 was enacted, giving the FDA enhanced post-marketing authority, including the authority to require post marketing studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with risk evaluations and mitigation strategies, or REMS, approved by the FDA. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers of drugs and biologics must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

Drug and biologic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs and biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, GTP applicable to biologics, and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.
 
The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product subsequent to its approval may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.
 
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our stem cell therapies. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our stem cell therapies to the extent we choose to clinically evaluate or sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States.
Third Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Coverage and reimbursement status of any approved therapy carries uncertainty and risk. In both the United States and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our stem cell therapies successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our stem cell therapies, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third party payors, including, in the United States, governmental payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. Medicare is a federally funded program managed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, through local fiscal intermediaries and carriers that administer coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled. Medicaid is an insurance program for certain categories of patients whose income and assets fall below state defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state. The federal government sets general guidelines for Medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern its individual program. Each payor has its own process and standards for determining whether it will cover and reimburse a procedure or particular product. Private payors often rely on the lead of the governmental payors in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, achieving favorable CMS coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product. The competitive position of some of our products will depend, in part, upon the extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement for such products and for the procedures in which such products are used. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our stem cell therapies can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payors.
 
Possible legislation at the Federal and State levels in the United States focused on cost containment and price transparency may impact our ability to sell our stem cell therapies for maximum profitably. It appears likely that the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing will continue, especially under the Medicare program, which may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Moreover, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our stem cell therapies.

The 21st Century Cures Act and its regenerative medicine provisions may be beneficial to the development of our stem cell therapy.  The 21st Century Cures Act was signed into law on Dec. 13, 2016.  The goal of this landmark legislation is to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new treatments.  It includes regenerative medicines provisions aimed at bringing new innovations and advances to patients quicker and more efficiently. On Nov. 16, 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a comprehensive regenerative medicine policy framework.  The draft guidance issued by the FDA defines the regenerative medicine provisions in the 21st Century Cures Act by providing additional information to further the development and access to innovative regenerative medicine therapies.
 
The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future healthcare reforms.
 
Some third party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices, biologics or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our stem cell therapies and operate profitably.
 
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular stem cell therapy to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and biologics, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. These regulations include:

· | the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement programs that are false or fraudulent; 
· | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
· | the federal transparency requirements under the Health Care Reform Law requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests; 
· | the FDCA, which among other things, strictly regulates drug and biologic product marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing stem cell therapies for off-label use and regulates the distribution of drug samples; and 
· | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Compliance with Environmental, Health and Safety Laws
 
In addition to FDA regulations, we are also subject to evolving federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. In the past, compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures. We believe that we comply in all material respects with existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to us. Compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the future may require additional capital expenditures.
Sales and Marketing
 
We intend to establish and maintain fully-equipped cGMP-certified Cell-Processing Centers in strategic locations to conduct NurOwn® production and distribution over the broadest geographic area. Each Cell-Processing Center would receive an initial bone marrow sample of the patient, harvested at a medical center. The patient’s MSC cells would be isolated and expanded, in order to produce an initial dose of NurOwn® cells. A master cell bank for each individual patient would be cryopreserved and maintained for production of subsequent, future NurOwn® doses on a long-term basis for future treatments. These doses would be produced as needed and transported to the medical centers, where they would then be transplanted back into the patient.
 
We intend to seek partnering opportunities with a strategic partner as we progress towards advanced clinical development and commercialization.
 
Competition
 
There are several clinical trials underway evaluating experimental treatments for ALS, of which only two are stem cell-based trials being conducted by other commercial entities. US-based Neuralstem (CUR) completed a Phase 2 intraspinal transplantation trial for its allogeneic, human (fetal) spinal cord derived neural stem cells. Data presented in 2015 this product to be safe and well-tolerated with no acceleration in disease progression due to the therapeutic intervention. Neuralstem has discussed plans for a for a larger, controlled, registration directed clinical trial but it is not clear if it will proceed with this trial. Q Therapeutics has gained FDA approval for a Phase 1/2 intraspinal transplantation study with its Q-Cells®, purified human glial progenitor cells isolated from brain tissue. Corestem, a Korean company, recently completed a Phase 1 trial in ALS showing that repeated intrathecal administration of autologous, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells was safe. No details about clinical benefit was reported and there is little public information available about Corestem.
 
Several experimental ALS therapies such as Masitinib (AB Science), NP-001 (Neuraltus), and Actemra (Tocilizimab, Genentech) are selectively targeting neuroinflammation. AB Science completed a Phase 3 trial for masitinib in ALS. However, a regulatory filing for masitinib in another indication, indolent systemic mastocytosis, was rejected by the EU's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) because of concerns about its adherence to good clinical practices. Neuraltus Pharma is developing NP001, is a small molecule that modulates macrophages to promote an anti-inflammatory state in order to reduce the rate of motoneuron loss. NP001 is currently being tested in a Phase 2 trial that was launched in September 2016, and topline results are expected in 2018. A previous Phase 2 study failed to show statistically significant benefit. Cytokinetics is a late stage biopharmaceutical company that recently completed a Phase 3 clinical trial with tirasemtiv, a muscle troponin sensitizer. This study failed to demonstrate an improvement in slow vital capacity, a measure of breathing strength or other functional improvement, and as a consequence, Cytokinetics has suspended the development of tirasemtiv. Amylyx Pharmaceuticals is developing AMX0035, a combination of two compounds, sodium phenylbutyrate and tauroursodeoxycholic acid, that are proposed to have a synergistic effect when administered together. Amylyx recently initiated a Phase 2 trial in ALS patients and topline results are expected in 2019. Therapies specifically targeting genetic mutations in a small subset of ALS patents, such as SOD1 and C9ORF72, are being evaluated using antisense oligonucleotide technology (Biogen, IONIS, and WAVE Therapeutics). In addition, academic institutions are also developing treatment candidates for ALS, including mesenchymal stem cells genetically modified to increase GDNF expression.
 
Currently, there are two approved ALS therapies, Riluzole and Radicava, that have demonstrated mild improvements in survival and ALS function, respectively. Riluzole, approved by the FDA in 1995, extends the time to death or ventilation by several months; however, it has not been shown to improve the daily functioning of ALS patients. Radicava (Edaravone) is a free radical scavenger recently approved by FDA (May 2017) based on a single Phase 3 study carried out in Japan
