ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are an ophthalmology-focused pharmaceutical company specialized in the development, production and sale of innovative medications that offer unique competitive advantages and serve unmet needs in the marketplace. We are committed to our company’s mission, of delivering high-quality novel medications to physicians and patients at affordable prices. We currently operate our business through several subsidiaries: ImprimisRx, a leading ophthalmology focused compounding business; Park Compounding, a custom compounding business focused on patient-specific orders; and Surface Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (or Surface), an ocular surface disease-focused 505(b)(2) specialty pharmaceutical subsidiary. We also own a passive interest, with royalty stakes on certain drug candidates, in Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (or Eton), a specialty pharmaceutical business utilizing the 505(b)(2) pathway, which Imprimis spun-out in 2017.
 
Nearly all of our sales revenue is derived from making, selling and dispensing our prescription drug formulations as cash transactions between us and our end-user customer. As such, the majority of our commercial transactions do not involve distributors, wholesalers, insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers or other middle parties. By not being reliant on insurance company formulary inclusion and pharmacy benefit manager payment clawbacks, we are able to simplify the prescription transaction process. We believe the outcome of our business model is a simple transaction, involving a patient-in-need, a physician’s diagnosis and a fair price and great service for a quality pharmaceutical product. We sell our products through a network of employees and independent contractors and we dispense our formulations in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and in selected markets outside the United States.
 
By building relationships with physicians to help them better care for their patients, we have become a trusted partner to a growing network of physician inventors who have relied on us to help develop their ideas into new pharmaceutical formulations. We work collaboratively with our physician inventors to identify and evaluate intellectual property related to their potential pharmaceutical drug candidates, assess relevant markets, and seek to validate any clinical experience they may have with the formulation. Our objective is to commercialize the formulation either as a compounded formulation or as an FDA approved product.

We have recurring operating losses and have had negative operating cash flows since July 24, 1998 (inception). In addition, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $88,836,000 at December 31, 2017. Beginning on April 1, 2014, when we acquired our first compounding pharmacy, we began generating revenue from sales of certain of our proprietary drug formulations and other non-proprietary formulations; however, we expect to incur further losses as we integrate and develop our pharmacy operations, evaluate other programs and continue the development of our formulations.
 
Compounding Businesses
 
Pharmaceutical Compounding
 
All of our commercial products are compounded by combining different active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), all of which are FDA-approved (either as a finished form or as a bulk drug ingredient), to create specialized preparations prescribed by a physician to treat an individually identified patient. Physicians prescribe our products because a standard medication approved by the FDA may not be appropriate for a particular patient’s needs. In many cases, compounded drugs such as ours have wide market utility and may be clinically appropriate for large patient populations. Examples of compounded formulations include medications with alternative dosage strengths or unique dosage forms, such as topical creams or gels, suspensions, or solutions with more tolerable drug delivery vehicles.
Our Compounding Facilities
 
Pharmaceutical compounding businesses are governed by Sections 503A and 503B of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”). Section 503A of the FDCA provides that a pharmacy is only permitted to compound a drug for an individually identified patient based on a prescription for that patient, and is only permitted to distribute the drug interstate if the pharmacy is licensed to do so in the states where it is compounded and where the medication is received.
 
Section 503B of the FDCA provides that a pharmacy engaged in preparing sterile compounded drug formulations may voluntarily elect to register as an “outsourcing facility.” Outsourcing facilities are permitted to compound large quantities of drugs without a prescription and distribute them out of state with certain limitations such as the formulation appearing on the FDA’s drug shortage list or the bulk drug substances contained in the formulations appearing on the FDA’s “clinical need” list. Entities voluntarily registering as outsourcing facilities are subject to additional requirements that do not apply to compounding pharmacies (operating under Section 503A of the FDCA), including adhering to current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) and being subject to regular FDA inspection.
 
We operate three compounding facilities. Our New Jersey operations comprises two separate entities and facilities, with one facility registered with the FDA as an outsourcing facility (“NJOF”) under Section 503B of the FDCA. The other New Jersey facility (“RxNJ”), and Park Compounding, Inc. (“Park”), our California based pharmacy, are both licensed pharmacies operating under Sections 503A of the FDCA. All products that we sell, produce and dispense are made in the United States of America.
 
We believe that, with our current compounding pharmacy facilities and licenses and the successful completion and FDA registration of NJOF, we have the infrastructure to scale our business appropriately under the current regulatory landscape and meet the growth in demand we are targeting. We plan to invest in one or more of our pharmacies to further their capacity and efficiencies. Also, we may seek to access greater redundancy and markets through acquisitions, partnerships or other strategic transactions.
 
ImprimisRx
 
ImprimisRx is our core ophthalmology focused compounding business. We offer our 1,700+ physician customers and their patients critical medicines to meet needs that are unmet by commercially available drugs. We make our formulations available at prices that are, in most cases, lower than non-customized commercial drugs. Our current ophthalmology formulary includes over twenty compounded formulations, many of which are patented or patent-pending, and are customized for the specific needs of a patient. Our compounded medications include various unique combinations of drugs formulated into one bottle and numerous preservative free formulations. Depending on the formulation, the regulations of a specific state and ultimately the needs of the patient (ImprimisRx products may be dispensed as patient-specific medications from our 503A facilities, or for in-office use made according to cGMPs in our FDA-registered NJOF outsourcing facility).
 
Ophthalmology Market
 
The three largest markets in the ophthalmology market in the U.S. are ocular surgery, glaucoma and dry eye disease.
 
For any ocular procedure, a surgeon may require drugs for sedation, dilation, and inflammation and infection prevention. The cataract surgery market continues to experience significant growth. According to a 2013 Market Scope report, 3.8 million cataract surgeries are performed annually in the U.S. and nearly 22 million cataract surgeries were performed globally, with expected annual market growth of approximately 3%. The National Eye Institute estimates that over 24 million Americans currently have cataracts and that this number will grow to 38 million by 2030 and reach more than 50 million by 2050. Transparency Market Research estimates that the ophthalmology drug market will reach an estimated $21.6 billion by 2018. In addition to the 3.8 million cataract surgeries performed annually in the U.S., the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) estimates that over one-half of Americans require some form of vision correction and 43 million of these individuals are candidates for refractive surgery. Nearly 96 percent of the refractive surgery procedures performed are LASIK (laser in situ keratomileusis) surgeries, an outpatient surgical procedure used to treat nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. According to Statista, an estimated 600,000 LASIK procedures were performed in the U.S. in 2015.

According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, there are over 3 million Americans with glaucoma but only half are aware they have it. Open-angle glaucoma (the most common type of glaucoma) is a condition of increased intraocular pressure that causes gradual loss of sight. Glaucoma is incurable, and if not managed can lead to blindness. Generally, the first line of treatment consists of a prostaglandin analogue (PGA) eye drop regimen. As the disease progresses, non-PGA products are generally added as a second line treatment. Topical agents, other than PGAs, include beta blockers, alpha agonists, miotics and steroids. Up to 50 percent of glaucoma patients require more than one drug following a few months of initial treatment, however the FDA has yet to approve a PGA combination product despite combination products including a PGA (Xalacom®, DuoTrav® and Ganfort®) available outside of the U.S. According to a 2017 Market Scope report, the glaucoma pharmaceuticals market is expected to reach $5.3 billion in 2022.
 
Dry eye occurs when the eye does not produce enough tears, or when the tears are not of the correct consistency and evaporate too quickly. Inflammation of the surface of the eye may also occur. We believe that dry eye disease, or DED, affects over 30 million people in the United States, and a major epidemiological study, the Beaver Dam Offspring Study, published in 2014 in the American Journal of Ophthalmology, reported that in a cohort of over 3,000 patients, DED was self-reported by 14.5% of the patients. According to a 2017 Market Scope report, the global dry eye treatments market is expected to grow from $3.7 billion in 2017 to $4.9 billion in 2022. Dry eye is among the most common conditions seen by eye care professionals.
 
Park Compounding
 
Park, our wholly owned subsidiary pharmacy based in Irvine, California, is focused on customizable pharmaceutical compounding. Park dispenses sterile and non-sterile compounded medications prescribed by licensed practitioners when commercially available choices do not meet a patient’s needs. Park also produces and dispenses certain of our ophthalmology based formulations.
505(b)(2) Specialty Pharmaceuticals Business
 
In 2017, through our subsidiary Surface Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and our former subsidiary (currently a passive non-controlling ownership interest in) Eton Pharmaceuticals Inc. we began and continue to, pursue FDA approval to market and sell one or more of our formulations through the FDA’s new drug application (NDA) process. Both Surface and Eton are pursuing FDA approvals for their drug candidates through a traditional approval under the FDCA, including Section 505(b)(2) which permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference.
Surface Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
Surface is a biopharmaceutical company focused on development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics for ocular surface diseases and is seeking FDA approval for the commercialization of its drug candidates through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway under the FDCA. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Imprimis transferred to Surface its current drug pipeline, which consists of three proprietary drug candidates. Our patent-pending preservative-free topical eye drop drug candidates, SURF-100 and SURF-200, utilize a patented delivery vehicle known as Klarity DropsTM (“Klarity”), that was invented by Imprimis board member and Surface’s chairman of the board and renowned ophthalmologist Dr. Richard Lindstrom. Klarity is designed to protect and rehabilitate the ocular surface pathology for patients with DED. Our drug candidate SURF-300 is a patent-pending oral capsule that will target patients also suffering from DED signs & symptoms.
Surface Drug Candidates
 
DED is a common, but complex disease of the ocular surface. Surface drug candidates have been formulated to target certain patient profiles that suffer from dry eye and the patients who do not respond well to current approved therapies:

● | SURF-100 marries Klarity with mycophenolic acid, an immunosuppressive drug, which we believe has a different mechanism of action to current approved DED therapies but ultimately inhibit t-cell proliferation and replication, which is similar to other approved DED therapies. We believe if approved, SURF-100 may be a first-line therapeutic choice for the nearly 9 million patients suffering from chronic, mild to moderate DED. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | SURF-200 is our drug candidate for the estimated 13 million patients suffering from episodic DED, which encompasses flares of moderate to severe signs and symptoms of dry eye and typically disables patients in their daily lives. SURF-200 also utilizes Klarity as its delivery vehicle and a well-known steroid, betamethasone, and will be used for a shorter-duration (e.g. two weeks) of therapy as symptoms are presented. We also believe that SURF-200 may be used to treat ocular inflammation and pain following ocular surgery, and we intend to pursue that label indication as part of our overall development program. 
● | SURF-300 is our drug candidate for the estimated 8 million refractory DED patients with chronic DED symptoms who have not yet responded to any of the existing therapies. It is a combination of a low-dose of doxycycline (an antibiotic) and a proprietary powderized, triglyceride Omega-3. Our patent-pending formulation has already demonstrated strong potential as drug candidate for these patients in an uncontrolled, small setting as a compounded drug: out of the 31 patients taking the compounded drug, 29 (94%) reported significant improvement in their DED signs and symptoms after 30 to 60 days. Additionally, investigators reported a marked improvement in Meibomian gland function, which we believe may be a strong implication for a label expansion for blepharitis. Blepharitis, which can also be caused by a bacterial infection, is an inflammation of the eyelid that causes inflamed, irritated, itchy and reddened eyelids, that we believe affects nearly 25 million people in the United States, with an estimated drug market in excess of $500 million and has no FDA approved pharmaceutical therapy.

We currently intend to finance Surface as a separate entity, and will likely lose our controlling interest. We are currently in discussions with various investment banks and investors, and we hope to close an initial round of financing for Surface during 2018. If successful in financing Surface, in addition to our equity position, we will maintain a single digit royalty on sales of contributed drug candidates.
 
In addition to Richard Lindstrom’s participation in Surface, Mark L. Baum, our CEO, Andrew R. Boll, our CFO, are members of the Surface board of directors. Mr. Boll and Mr. Baum, along with other Imprimis employees have entered into consulting agreements with Surface.
 
Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
Eton is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative products utilizing FDA’s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Its pipeline includes nearly a dozen products in various stages of development across a variety of dosage forms. Eton’s pipeline is focused on innovative 505(b)(2) products and marketed unapproved drugs.
 
In May 2017, we entered into two asset purchase and license agreements (the “Eton License Agreements”) with our previously wholly owned subsidiary, Eton. Pursuant to the terms of the Eton License Agreements, we assigned and licensed to Eton certain intellectual property and related rights to develop, formulate, make, sell, and sub-license our proprietary formulations of synthetic corticotropin (Eton drug candidate CT-100) and a patented injectable pentoxifylline (collectively, the “Imprimis Products”). Eton intends to seek FDA approval for the commercialization of these drug candidates through the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. If these drug candidates are approved by the FDA, Eton is required to make royalty payments to us on the Imprimis Products. In addition to the Imprimis Products, Eton has acquired several additional 505(b)(2) drug candidates and ones that qualify under the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) program which it plans to develop and commercialize through the 505(b)(2) pathway. Imprimis is only eligible to receive royalties on the Imprimis Products (corticotropin and pentoxifylline), and will not receive royalties on any other drug candidates currently being developed by Eton.
 
The Eton License Agreements became effective in June 2017, when Eton closed an offering of its Series A Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of approximately $20 million (the “Series A Round”). At the time of closing we lost our controlling interest, and deconsolidated Eton from our consolidated financial statements. We currently own 3.5 million shares of Eton common stock, which is approximately 27% of the equity and voting interests issued and outstanding of Eton following the close of the Series A Round.
 
In October 2017, Eton had a Pre-IND meeting with FDA to discuss clinical trial requirements for CT-100. The FDA requested Eton run a single efficacy clinical trial. Eton expects to initiate the trial in the second half of 2018. Eton intends to have initial discussions with FDA regarding clinical trial requirements for its pentoxifylline drug candidate some time during 2018.
 
Mark L. Baum, our CEO is a member of the Eton board of directors, and Andrew R. Boll, our CFO, was a member of the Eton board of directors until his resignation from the Eton board in July 2017. Mr. Boll and Mr. Baum, along with other Imprimis employees have entered into consulting agreements with Eton.
 
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
 
As discussed in more detail above under the sub-headings Surface Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc. we own equity positions in two pharmaceutical companies and royalty interests in certain of their drug candidates. As an alternate path for FDA approval of new indications or new formulations of previously-approved products, a company may file a Section 505(b)(2) NDA instead of a “stand-alone” or “full” NDA. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Some examples of products that may be allowed to follow a 505(b)(2) path to approval are drugs that have a new dosage form, strength, route of administration, formulation or indication.
 
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit the applicant to rely upon certain published nonclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product or the FDA’s conclusions from prior review of such studies. The FDA may require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support any changes from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product for all or some of the labeled indications for which the reference product has been approved, as well as for any new indication supported by the Section 505(b)(2) application. While references to nonclinical and clinical data not generated by the applicant or for which the applicant does not have a right of reference are allowed, all development, process, stability, qualification and validation data related to the manufacturing and quality of the new product must be included in an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2).

To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s conclusions regarding studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the reference product has expired. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its products only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its products may be commercialized. In addition to Surface and Eton, we may develop other subsidiary companies and drug candidates that pursue this approval pathway.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Although we believe that our proprietary drug formulations could have commercial appeal in international markets and we have engaged distributors and entered into out-licensing arrangements for certain of our proprietary formulations in certain non-U.S. markets, including Canada, we expect to continue to focus our sales and marketing efforts on our U.S. commercial opportunities during 2017. Our sales and marketing efforts are currently organized into two teams, the larger of which focuses on our ophthalmology compounding business and the other on our non-ophthalmology compounding business. Our sales and marketing activities consist primarily of efforts to educate doctors, ambulatory surgery centers, healthcare systems, hospitals and other users throughout the U.S. about our compounded formulations. We expect that we may experience growth in the sales of our proprietary compounded formulations in future periods, particularly in light of our current and planned launches of new formulations and commercialization campaigns. However, we may not be successful in doing so, whether due to the safety, quality or availability of our proprietary compounded formulations, the size of the markets for such formulations, which could be smaller than we expect, the timing of market entry relative to competitive products, the availability of alternative compounded formulations or FDA-approved drugs, the price of our compounded formulations relative to alternative products or the success of our sales and marketing efforts, which is dependent on our ability to build and grow a qualified and adequate internal sales function.
 
In 2017 and 2018, we entered various sales and marketing agreements, with certain organizations, including the Cameron Ehlen Group, Inc. dba Precision Lens on April 13, 2017, to provide exclusive sales and marketing representation services to Imprimis in select geographies in the U.S., in connection with our ophthalmic compounded formulations. Under the terms of the sales and marketing agreements, we are required to make commission payments to equal to 10% - 14% of net sales for products above and beyond the initial existing sales amounts. In addition, we are required to make periodic milestone payments to certain organizations in shares of the our restricted common stock if net sales in the assigned territory reach certain future levels by the end of their terms, as applicable. We believe these sales and marketing agreements will accelerate launches of our new ophthalmology programs and limit our initial capital requirements commonly associated with new product launches and increased sizes of sales forces.
 
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and pharmacy industries are highly competitive. We compete against branded drug companies, generic drug companies, outsourcing facilities and other compounding pharmacies. We are significantly smaller than some of our competitors, and we may lack the financial and other resources needed to develop, produce, distribute, market and commercialize any of our proprietary formulations or compete for market share in these sectors. The drug products available through branded and generic drug companies with which our formulations compete have been approved for marketing and sale by the FDA and are required to be manufactured in facilities compliant with cGMP standards. Although we prepare some of our compounded formulations in accordance with cGMP standards and our other formulations are produced according to the standards provided by United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) <795> and USP <797> and applicable state and federal law, our proprietary compounded formulations are not required to be, and have not been, approved for marketing and sale by the FDA. As a result, some physicians may be unwilling to prescribe, and some patients may be unwilling to use, our formulations. Additionally, under federal and state laws applicable to our current compounding pharmacy operations operating under Section 503A of the FDCA, we are not permitted to prepare significant amounts of a specific formulation in advance of a prescription, compound quantities for office use or utilize a wholesaler for distribution of our formulations; instead, our compounded formulations must be prepared and dispensed in connection with a physician prescription for an individually identified patient. Pharmaceutical companies, on the other hand, are able to sell their FDA-approved products to large pharmaceutical wholesalers, who can in turn sell to and supply hospitals and retail pharmacies. Even though we have registered NJOF with the FDA, our business may not be scalable on the scope available to our competitors that produce FDA-approved drugs, which may limit our potential for profitable operations. These facets of our operations may subject our business to limitations our competitors offering FDA-approved drugs may not face.
 
Biotechnology and related pharmaceutical technologies have undergone and continue to be subject to rapid and significant change. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies. Products developed by our competitors, including FDA-approved drugs and compounded formulations created by other pharmacies, could render our products and technologies obsolete or unable to compete. Any products that we develop may become obsolete before we recover expenses incurred in developing the products, which may require that we seek to raise additional funds that may or may not be available to continue our operations. The competitive environment requires an ongoing, extensive search for medical and technological innovations and the ability to develop and market these innovations effectively, and we may not be competitive with respect to these factors. Other competitive factors include the safety and efficacy of a product, the size of the market for a product, the timing of market entry relative to competitive products, the availability of alternative compounded formulations or approved drugs, the price of a product relative to alternative products, the availability of third-party reimbursement, the success of sales and marketing efforts, brand recognition and the availability of scientific and technical information about a product. Although we believe we are positioned to compete favorably with respect to many of these factors, if our proprietary formulations are unable to compete with the products of our competitors, we may never gain market share or achieve profitability.

Intellectual Property
 
Our success and ability to compete depends upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. We conduct a fulsome analysis of the intellectual property landscape prior to acquiring rights to formulations and filing patent applications. In addition, as of February 19, 2018, we owned and/or licensed 32 U.S. patent applications, including 31 utility (including continuation, continuation-in-part and divisional) and one provisional patent applications, and we owned nine international patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and 30 foreign patent applications. Although our ophthalmology-related patent applications include claims related to non-ophthalmology fields, we have primarily focused our intellectual property development efforts to date on the proprietary compounded formulations in the field of ophthalmology. We presently have 11 U.S. and nine foreign patent applications pending that relate to our SSP Technology. We expect to file additional patent applications in the U.S. and pursue patent protection for certain of our formulations in other important international jurisdictions in the future.
 
As of February 19, 2018, we had worldwide 167 issued trademarks, pending trademark and copyright applications, or registered copyright and/or trademarks for Imprimis®, ImprimisRx®, Imprimis Pharmaceuticals®, Imprimis Cares®, Imprimis Cares!®, SSP Technology®, Dropless®, Go Dropless®, Go Dropless! ®, GoDropless®, LessDrops®, Dropless Cataract Surgery®, Dropless Cataract Therapy®, Dropless Therapy®, Tri-Moxi®, Pred-Moxi®, HLA®, Triple Drop®, ED Free®, Defeat IC©, Defeat IC®, Say Goodbye©, PPS-DR®, Stericheck™, Pred-Moxi-Ketor™, Pred-Moxi-Brom™, Pred-Ketor®, Dex-Moxi®, Combination Drop Therapy™, Compounded Choice™, Pred-Gati™, Pred-Gati-Nepaf™, Pred-Nepaf™, Correct Compound™, Making Drugs Affordable Again™, Superbundle™, People-Focused™, MKO Melt™, IV Free™, Imprimis Dropless Cataract Therapy®, LessDrops® (logo), Imprimis LessDrops®, Imprimis Dropless Cataract Surgery®, Pred-Gati™, Pred-Gati-Nepaf™, Pred-Nepaf™, Pred-Gati-Brom™, Pred-Gati-Ketor™, Dex-Moxi-Ketor™, Moxi™, Dex-Gati™, Correct Compound™, Lat™, Lat-Ds™, Tim-Lat™, Tim-Dor-Lat™, Tim-Brim-Dor™, Tim-Brim-Dor-Lat™, Pred-Levo-Ketor™, Pred-Levo-Brom™, Pred-Levo-Nepaf™, Tri-Moxi-Vanc™, Smartdrops™, Smarteyedrops™, Serum Tears™, Plasma Tears™, Omegadoxy™, Double Drop™, Quad Drop™, Lower Drops™, Simple Drops™, Droppy™, Droppy™ (logo), Droppy™ (drawing), Eton™, Eton Pharmaceuticals™, Surface™, Surface Pharmaceuticals™, Your Tears™, Total Tears™, Pharmapack™, Klarity Drops™, EyeMelt™, Gati-Dex™, Imprimis Glaucoma Care™, Klarity C-Drops™, Pred-Brom™, Total Tears™ (Logo), and Simple Tears™ (logo). We may choose to pursue trademark protection in other jurisdictions for one or more of these or other marks in the future.
 
We also rely on unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation in order to develop our formulations, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators and others, including certain service providers. We also have invention or patent assignment agreements with our current employees and certain consultants. However, our employees and consultants may breach these agreements and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, or our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. In addition, inventions relevant to us could be developed by a person not bound by an invention assignment agreement with us, in which case we may have no rights to use the applicable invention.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices, including, among others: federal, state and local licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2012 (collectively, the Health Reform Law); statutes and regulations of the FDA, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as regulations promulgated by comparable state agencies concerning the sale, advertisement and promotion of the products we sell. The regulatory and quality compliance environment for compounded drugs has become significantly more rigorous, complex and strict since the passage of The Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013. The complexity of the current state and federal regulatory environment, as well as the expected continued evolution of state and federal laws governing pharmaceutical compounding, have and will continue to present potentially significant challenges to our business model and the fulfillment of our mission as a company. Below are descriptions of some of the various federal and state laws and regulations which may govern or impact our current and planned operations.
Pharmacy Regulation
 
Our pharmacy operations are regulated by both individual states and the federal government. Every state has laws and regulations addressing pharmacy operations, including regulations relating specifically to compounding pharmacy operations. These regulations generally include licensing requirements for pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacies, as well as regulations related to compounding processes, safety protocols, purity, sterility, storage, controlled substances, recordkeeping and regular inspections, among other things. State rules and regulations are updated periodically, generally under the jurisdiction of individual state boards of pharmacy. Failure to comply with the state pharmacy regulations of a particular state could result in a pharmacy being prohibited from operating in that state, financial penalties and/or becoming subject to additional oversight from that state’s board of pharmacy. In addition, many states are considering imposing, or have already begun to impose, more stringent requirements on compounding pharmacies. If our pharmacy operations become subject to additional licensure requirements, are unable to maintain their required licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on pharmacies, our ability to operate in some states could be limited.

Federal law limits compounding pharmacies from engaging in the practice of anticipatory compounding, which involves, preparing compounded medications before the actual receipt of a prescription or practitioner’s order, unless the compounding pharmacy has a history of filling certain prescriptions for a customer. In such cases, it is acceptable to engage in anticipatory compounding or the preparation of larger batches so that medications will be ready when they are needed. Anticipatory compounding also reduces the cost of compounded medications, as economies of scale can be realized by producing larger batches. Anticipatory compounding also leads to less wasted chemicals, dilutions, fillers, and other associated products are produced, and greater accuracy and uniformity in finished medications, as larger batches decrease the variation caused by preparing multiple, smaller batches. Based on our history of meeting the needs of our customers, we are able to anticipatorily compound batches of our formulations for our customers
 
Many of the states into which we deliver pharmaceuticals have laws and regulations that require out-of-state pharmacies to register with, or be licensed by, the boards of pharmacy or similar regulatory bodies in those states. These states generally permit the dispensing pharmacy to follow the laws of the state within which the dispensing pharmacy is located. However, various state pharmacy boards have enacted laws and/or adopted rules or regulations directed at restricting or prohibiting the operation of out-of-state pharmacies by, among other things, requiring compliance with all laws of the states into which the out-of-state pharmacy dispenses medications, whether or not those laws conflict with the laws of the state in which the pharmacy is located, or requiring the pharmacist-in-charge to be licensed in that state. To the extent that such laws or regulations are found to be applicable to our operations, we believe we comply with them.
 
Further, under federal law, Section 503A of the FDCA seeks to limit the amount of compounded products that a pharmacy can dispense interstate. The interpretation and enforcement of this provision is dependent on the FDA entering into a standard Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with each state setting forth limits on shipments of interstate compounding. Previously, the draft MOU presented by the FDA in February 2015 intended to limit interstate shipments of compounded drug units to 30% of all compounded and non-compounded units dispensed or distributed by the pharmacy per month, the excess of which the FDA considered an “inordinate amount.” The FDA stated in the guidance issued in February 2015 that it would not enforce interstate restrictions until after it published a final MOU and made it available to states for signature for some designated period of time. If the final MOU was drafted and released by the FDA and was not signed by a particular state, then interstate shipments of compounded preparations from a pharmacy located in that state would be limited to quantities not greater than 5% of total prescription orders dispensed or distributed by the pharmacy; however, we are not aware that the FDA currently enforces or has in the past enforced the 5% rule and, under current draft guidance, the FDA had historically stated that it would not enforce the 5% rule until a final MOU was made available to states for signature. The FDA originally proposed a 180-day period for states to agree to the final MOU after the final version was presented, which to date has not occurred, before it would begin to enforce the 5% rule. In January of 2018, the FDA released a “2018 Compounding Policy Priorities Plan” (the “2018 Compounding Plan”) which provided an overview of the key priorities the FDA plans to focus on in 2018 in connection with compounding regulations. One of the priorities outlined in the 2018 Compounding Plan addressed the current status of the MOU and the FDA’s plan to release a revised MOU (the “Revised MOU”). Pursuant to the statements in the Compounding Plan, the Revised MOU would consider amounts shipped interstate by a compounder to be inordinate amounts if the “number of prescriptions of compounded drugs distributed interstate during any calendar month is greater than 50 percent.” Importantly, instead of that number serving as a “hard limit, for state action,” the 50%target would trigger certain additional reporting requirements. The Revised MOU will also provide states more time to report to the FDA, and flexibility on identifying when amounts are inordinate, considering the size and scope of compounding operations. Until the Revised MOU is issued and presented to states to consider, the extent of interstate dispensing restrictions imposed by Section 503A is unknown. However, if the final Revised MOU contains a 50% limit on interstate distribution, dependent on the additional reporting requirements to be outlined in the Revised MOU, our pharmacy operations could be materially limited.
 
Certain provisions of the FDCA govern the preparation, handling, storage, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (DQSA) clarifies and strengthens the federal regulatory framework governing compounding pharmacies. Title 1 of the DQSA, the Compounding Quality Act, modifies provisions of the Section 503A of the FDCA that were found to be unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002. In general, Section 503A provides that pharmacies are exempt from the provisions of the FDCA requiring compliance with cGMP, labeling with adequate directions for use and FDA approval prior to marketing if the pharmacy complies with certain other requirements. Among other things, to comply with Section 503A, a compounded drug must be compounded by a licensed pharmacist for an identified individual patient on the basis of a valid prescription. Pharmacies may only compound in limited quantities before receipt of a prescription for an individual patient and are subject to limitations on anticipatory compounding for distribution, which generally permit anticipatory compounding only based on historical prescription volumes.
 
The DQSA also contained new Section 503B of the FDCA, which established an outsourcing facility as a new form of entity that is permitted to compound larger quantities of drug formulations without a prescription, thus permitting the practice of anticipatory compounding, and distributing them out of state without limitation, if the drug formulations appear on the FDA’s drug shortage list or the bulk drug substances contained in the formulations appear on a “clinical need” list to be established by the FDA. Entities voluntarily registering as outsourcing facilities are subject to cGMP requirements and regular FDA inspection, among other requirements. As described above, our current pharmacy operations in NJ and CA are governed by Section 503A of the FDCA, and our NJ based outsourcing facility is governed by Section 503B of the FDCA.

Confidentiality, Privacy and HIPAA
 
Our pharmacy operations involve the receipt, use and disclosure of confidential medical, pharmacy and other health-related information. In addition, we use aggregated and blinded (anonymous) data for research and analysis purposes. The federal privacy regulations under HIPAA are designed to protect the medical information of a healthcare patient or health plan enrollee that could be used to identify the individual. Among other things, HIPAA limits certain uses and disclosures of protected health information and requires compliance with federal security regulations regarding the storage, utilization and transmission of and access to electronic protected health information. The requirements imposed by HIPAA are extensive. In addition, most states have enacted privacy and security laws that protect identifiable patient information that is not health-related. Further, several states have enacted more protective and comprehensive pharmacy-related privacy legislation that not only applies to patient records but also prohibits the transfer or use for commercial purposes of pharmacy data that identifies prescribers. These regulations impose substantial requirements on covered entities and their business associates regarding the storage, utilization and transmission of and access to personal health and non-health information. Many of these laws apply to our business.
 
Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement
 
Medicare is a federally funded program that provides health insurance coverage for qualified persons age 65 or older and for some disabled persons with certain specific conditions. State-funded Medicaid programs provide medical benefits to groups of low-income and disabled individuals, some of whom may have inadequate or no medical insurance. Currently, most of our commercially available formulations are sold in cash transactions and our customers may choose to seek reimbursement opportunities from Medicare, Medicaid and other third parties. We work with third-party insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and buying groups to offer patient-specific customizable compounded formulations at accessible prices. We plan to continue to devote time and other resources to seek reimbursement and patient pay opportunities for these and other compounded formulations and we have hired pharmacy billers to process certain existing reimbursement opportunities for certain formulations. However, we may be unsuccessful in achieving these goals, as many third-party payors have imposed significant restrictions on reimbursement for compounded formulations in recent years. Moreover, third-party payors, including Medicare, are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and by refusing, in some cases, to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA has not granted labeling approval. Further, the Health Reform Law may have a considerable impact on the existing U.S. system for the delivery and financing of health care and could conceivable have a material effect on our business. As a result, reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors may never be available for any of our products or, if available, may not be sufficient to allow us to sell the products on a competitive basis and at desirable price points.
 
To the extent we obtain third-party reimbursement for our compounded formulations, we may become subject to Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plan regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims.
 
FDA New Drug Application Process
 
As discussed in other sections of this report, we are and may continue to, alone or with project partners, pursue FDA approval to market and sell one or more of our formulations through the FDA’s NDA process. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA’s conclusions regarding studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book publication. As a condition of approval, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require further studies, including Phase 4 post-marketing studies, to provide additional data. Other post-marketing studies may be required to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those for which the product was initially tested and approved. Also, the FDA or other regulatory authorities require post-marketing reporting to monitor the adverse effects of a drug. Results of post-marketing programs may limit or expand the further marketing of a product.
 
The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, fines and potential civil and criminal penalties.
 
International Regulation
 
If we pursue commercialization of our proprietary formulations in countries other than the United States, then we may need to obtain the approvals required by the regulatory authorities of such foreign countries that are comparable to the FDA and state boards of pharmacy, and we would be subject to a variety of other foreign statutes and regulations comparable to those relating to our U.S. operations. Regulatory frameworks and requirements vary by country and could involve significant additional licensing requirements and product testing and review periods.

Environmental and Other Matters
 
We are or may become subject to environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, any use and disposal by us of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research and preparation of our formulations. In addition, we are subject to work safety and labor laws that govern certain of our operations and our employee relations. In each of these areas, as described above, the FDA and other government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, licenses or permits, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Research and Development Expenses
 
Our research and development expenses incurred in 2017 and 2016 primarily include expenses related to the development of intellectual property, researcher and investigator-initiated evaluations, and research and formulation development related primarily to our ophthalmic formulations and certain other assets.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred $413,000 in research and development expenses, as compared to $739,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
Employees
 
As of March 1, 2018, we employed 128 employees. Our employees are engaged in pharmacy operations, sales, marketing, research, development, and general and administrative functions. We expect to add additional employees in all departmental functions as we carry out our business plan in the next 12 months. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements with any of our employees. We have never experienced a work stoppage, and we believe our employee relations are good. We hire independent contractor labor and consultants on an as-needed basis.
