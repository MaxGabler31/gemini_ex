 Item 1.  BUSINESS
 GENERAL
 Golden Growers Cooperative is a value-added agricultural cooperative association owned by 1,546 members primarily from Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, all of whom deliver corn to the Cooperative for processing into a value-added product.  The Cooperative was originally formed in 1994 as a North Dakota agricultural cooperative.  On September 1, 2009, by way of a series of mergers, the Cooperative changed its domicile and form of entity from a North Dakota cooperative to a Minnesota cooperative association governed under Minnesota Statutes Chapter 308B.  A Minnesota cooperative association formed under Minnesota Statutes 308B operates as a cooperative for state law purposes, but is taxed as a partnership under Subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code for tax purposes. History
 The Cooperative was originally formed in 1994 as a North Dakota cooperative with the goal of allowing its members to receive additional value from the corn that they grow through the processing of that corn into value-added products, such as corn sweeteners.  The Cooperative accomplished this purpose by forming a joint venture with American Crystal Sugar Company (“American Crystal”) that formed ProGold Limited Liability Company (“ProGold”), a Minnesota limited liability company that designed and constructed a corn wet-milling facility in Wahpeton, North Dakota to process corn into high fructose corn syrup and related co-products.  The Cooperative’s membership in ProGold included a right and obligation for the Cooperative to deliver corn to the ProGold facility for processing.  The Cooperative’s members delivered corn to the ProGold facility on the Cooperative’s behalf to meet this delivery obligation.
 On November 1, 1997, ProGold entered into an operating lease with Cargill Incorporated (“Cargill”) for the entire ProGold facility.  Cargill has operated the facility continually since this time.  On April 4, 2017, ProGold and Cargill entered into a Second Amended and Restated Facility Lease, which commenced on January 1, 2018 and continues through December 31, 2022. The lease will be automatically extended for one year in the event that either (i) Cargill has not, prior to December 31, 2021, exercised an option to purchase American Crystal’s 50% interest in ProGold pursuant to an Option Agreement between Cargill and American Crystal dated as of April 4, 2017 and effective as of January 1, 2018 or (ii) if the parties have not otherwise mutually agreed to extend or terminate the lease.  While ProGold no longer operates the wet-milling facility, the Cooperative, through its members, continues to have the obligation to deliver corn directly to Cargill at the wet-milling facility for processing into high fructose corn syrup and related co-products.  For more information regarding the Second Amended and Restated Facility Lease and the Option Agreement, see “Business Operations” and “Ownership in ProGold.”
 The Cooperative’s ownership interest in ProGold creates a value-added relationship between the Cooperative’s members and the facility.  When members deliver corn to the Cooperative for processing at the facility, they are paid a market price for the corn that is delivered.  In addition, members have a right to receive added value for the efforts in the form of patronage based on each member’s proportionate share of the Cooperative’s income from ProGold that is derived primarily from Cargill’s lease of the facility.  For more details regarding the Cooperative’s ownership in ProGold, see “Ownership in ProGold.”

 Business Operations
 The Cooperative is in the business of providing value to its members by facilitating their delivery of corn to the corn wet-milling facility owned by ProGold.  We accomplish our business on behalf of our members not through the ownership of assets such as a plant and equipment, but through our contract relationships with all of the parties involved in the ownership and operation of the facility.  From an income production perspective, our membership interest in ProGold is our primary asset that, in addition to giving the Cooperative the right to receive distributions from ProGold, also provides our members with additional value for the delivery of their corn for processing.  Annually, the Cooperative is required to deliver approximately 15,490,480 bushels of corn to Cargill for processing at the ProGold facility.  We meet this delivery obligation by having our members deliver their corn to the ProGold facility.
 Since November 1997, ProGold has leased its corn wet-milling facility to Cargill.  Throughout the term of the lease between Cargill and ProGold, our members, on the Cooperative’s behalf, have delivered corn to the facility for processing into high fructose corn syrup and related co-products.  It is our ownership interest in ProGold that creates a value-added relationship between our growers and the facility.  Notwithstanding this cooperative arrangement, Cargill is an integral part of our financial success.  Separate from the lease, Cargill also provides the Cooperative services that allow us to facilitate corn delivery at little or no expense.  In addition, the lease payments Cargill makes to ProGold that are in turn distributed to the Cooperative provide us with the cash to make distributions to our members. Under the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Facility Lease, Cargill will pay ProGold annual lease payments of $17 million in 2018 and 2019, $16 million in 2020, $15.5 million in 2021 and 2022, and $14 million if the lease is extended through 2023.  In turn, ProGold has agreed to pay at least $750,000 annually throughout the term of the lease for infrastructure maintenance and may also be required to pay additional sums in order to make certain capital improvements.  The payments will reduce any income available for ProGold’s members at the time of such expenses.  The Cooperative and American Crystal would experience any such reduction in ProGold’s income proportionately based on their percentage ownership of ProGold.
 Any person residing in the United States can own our Units as long as that person delivers or provides for the delivery of corn for processing at the ProGold facility.  Ownership of our Units requires our members to deliver corn to the Cooperative in proportion to the number of Units each member holds.  Currently 15,490,480 Units are issued and outstanding.  The Cooperative’s income and losses are allocated to our members based on the volume of corn a member delivers or has delivered.  Subject to certain limitations, as long as a member patronizes the Cooperative by delivering corn equal to the number of Units held by the member, the member will be allocated a corresponding portion of our income (or loss).  In this way, we operate on a cooperative basis.
 To hold our Units a member is required to execute a Uniform Member Agreement that obligates the member to deliver corn to us and an Annual Delivery Agreement by which each member annually elects the member’s method to deliver corn — either Method A or Method B, or a combination of both.  Under Method A, a member is required to physically deliver the required bushels of corn to us either at the ProGold facility or another location designated by the Cooperative.  Under Method B, a member appoints us as its agent to arrange for the acquisition and delivery of the required bushels of corn on the member’s behalf.  Separate from leasing the facility from ProGold, Cargill is in the grain services business.  In order to most cost effectively provide delivery services to our members, the Cooperative has entered into an agreement with Cargill whereby we appoint Cargill as our agent to arrange for the delivery of the corn by our members who elect to deliver corn using Method A, and we appoint Cargill as our agent to acquire corn on our behalf for our members who elect to deliver corn using Method B.  If a member elects to deliver corn using Method B, the price per bushel the Cooperative pays to the member is equal to the price per bushel paid by Cargill to acquire the corn as our agent.  The Cooperative pays members who deliver corn under Method A the market price or contracted price for their corn at the time of delivery.  Members who deliver corn under Method A receive from the Cooperative an incentive payment of $.05 per bushel on the corn that they deliver while members who elect Method B to deliver corn pay to the Cooperative a $.02 per bushel agency fee for the cost of having us deliver corn on their behalf.  The incentive payment for Method A deliveries and the agency fee for Method B deliveries are subject to annual adjustment at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. While the Cooperative is financially responsible for the various payments to the members for corn, Cargill, serving as the Cooperative’s administrative agent, issues payments to members for corn on the Cooperative’s behalf.
 Annually, we notify Cargill of the number of bushels of Method A corn to be delivered by each member who has elected to deliver corn by Method A.  Once we provide notification to Cargill of the number of bushels of corn, Cargill then confirms the amount of corn with each member and notifies that member with respect to quality specifications, allowances, deductions and premiums to be applicable to that corn.  That Method A member then directly

contracts with Cargill for the contract price agreed upon for the corn or, in the absence of an agreed upon price, the market price per bushel for corn delivered on the day on which the corn is delivered and accepted at the facility.  With respect to all corn that is delivered by Method A, Cargill pays to the Cooperative the aggregate purchase price for corn purchased from our members, and then, on our behalf, makes individual payments for corn directly to our members.  In the event a member who has elected to deliver corn by Method A delivers to Cargill more than its delivery commitment, any corn delivered in excess of that commitment is handled as a direct sale of corn to Cargill and is priced at the current closing delivery corn price established by Cargill at the facility on the day it is unloaded.  In the event a member who has elected to deliver corn by Method A delivers to Cargill less than its committed amount of corn, the quantity of the shortfall is then purchased and delivered by Cargill on our behalf.  Our reimbursement to Cargill for the purchased corn is calculated as the amount by which the underlying contracted corn price is less than the price of buying the corn that was due on the delivery date.  In addition, this purchased corn is not credited to such member’s account, meaning that member’s allocation of our profit or losses and any cash distributions are proportionately reduced and we may terminate the member’s membership.
 Based on the corn to be delivered by our members using Method A, Cargill then purchases the remainder of the corn to be delivered by us on behalf of our Method B delivering members at such time and in such quantities and at such prices it deems appropriate and in the best interest of us and Cargill.  Because Cargill purchases the corn on our behalf for our members who elect to deliver using Method B, the purchase price for the corn that would be paid to our members if they actually delivered the corn is offset against the payment to be made by us to Cargill for the cost to purchase the corn, thus no payment is made from Cargill to us for corn delivered using Method B.
 Our members can change their delivery method annually, so the mix of members delivering by Method A or Method B changes each year.
 In exchange for the services set forth above with respect to handling our member’s delivery of corn to the wet-milling facility, we paid Cargill an annual fee of $70,000 in 2017. Commencing on January 1, 2018, we pay an annual fee of $60,000, which is paid in quarterly installments.  In addition, we also pay Cargill a per-bushel fee if a Method A member fails to deliver corn.  This amount is in addition to any reimbursement required by us to Cargill for a Method A member’s failure to deliver.
 All of our agreements with Cargill terminate at the expiration of the lease between Cargill and ProGold.  We cannot predict if we will be able to continue on the same contract or economic terms with Cargill after December 31, 2022 if the lease is not extended or renewed.
 Our Bylaws establish a Method A delivery pool and a Method B delivery pool.  Generally, our income and/or losses are allocated annually based on the percentage of bushels of corn our members elect to deliver using either Method A or Method B.  Regardless of the actual percentage allocation between our members who deliver bushels of corn using Method A or Method B, our Bylaws require us to annually allocate at least 25% of our income and/or losses to the Method A pool.  The amount of our income and/or losses actually allocated to the Method A pool is a percentage equal to the greater of 25% or the actual percentage of bushels of corn delivered by our members using Method A.
 If less than 25% of the bushels of corn are delivered by members using Method A, the members who do use Method A will be allocated 25% of our income and/or losses even though they deliver less than 25% of the bushels of corn obligated to be delivered by us to Cargill.  As a result of this requirement, a Method A member may receive a greater proportionate allocation of our income and/or losses than a Method B member who contracted to have the same amount of corn delivered.
 For the 2016 and 2017 fiscal years, our members elected to and delivered 28.7% and 28.6%, respectively, of the bushels of corn by Method A and 71.3% and 71.4%, respectively, of the bushels of corn by Method B.  This resulted in 28.7% and 28.6% of our income and/or losses and 28.7% and 28.6% of any cash distributions being allocated to the Method A pool, respectively, in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, which reflects the actual percentage of members who elected to deliver corn using Method A and does not result in reallocation to meet the 25% requirement set forth in our governing documents.
 Ownership in ProGold
 The Cooperative owns a 49% interest in ProGold, and American Crystal owns a 51% interest in ProGold.  American Crystal’s fiscal year ends on August 31 each year, so ProGold’s fiscal year aligns with American Crystal’s.

 In connection with its membership interest in ProGold, the Cooperative has the right and obligation to deliver corn to be processed at the wet-milling facility.  The Cooperative is also allocated 49% of the profits and losses of ProGold and is entitled to receive 49% of any cash that is distributed to ProGold’s members.
 Currently, there are eleven members of ProGold’s board of governors and the Cooperative has the right to appoint five of these governors.  Members of the Cooperative’s Board of Directors occupy these seats and provide active oversight of the management of ProGold.  Based on percentage ownership in ProGold and representation on the ProGold board of governors the Cooperative does not control the operations of ProGold.  Extraordinary transactions such as a sale of ProGold or its assets, dissolution, as well as amendments to its operating agreement, approval of its strategic plan, approval of new members and approval of loans to ProGold by its members can be approved by American Crystal over the Cooperative’s objections.
 Even though the Cooperative does not control ProGold, American Crystal cannot sell or transfer its interest in ProGold to any other party without the Cooperative’s consent.  The Cooperative also has a right of first refusal to purchase American Crystal’s interest in ProGold if it receives an offer for or desires to sell its interests in ProGold.  Neither the Cooperative nor American Crystal can transfer its interests in ProGold without Cargill’s consent as long as the lease between Cargill and ProGold is in effect.  American Crystal may buy the Cooperative’s interests in ProGold if any one person acquires more than 10% of the Cooperative’s Units or if the Cooperative changes its voting structure to anything other than one member one vote.
 On April 4, 2017, the Cooperative, Cargill, and American Crystal entered into a Consent Agreement, effective on January 1, 2018, relating to the lease of ProGold’s wet-milling facility to Cargill and the Cooperative’s interest in ProGold. On the same day, Cargill and American Crystal entered into an Option Agreement, effective on January 1, 2018, detailing the price, term and other conditions under which American Crystal grants to Cargill an exclusive option to purchase a 50% interest in ProGold from American Crystal during the first four years of the lease. Under the Consent Agreement, the Cooperative approves and consents to the transfer of the 50% interest in ProGold from American Crystal to Cargill in the event Cargill exercises its option.  The Cooperative also secures the right to purchase American Crystal’s remaining 1% interest in ProGold for a base price ranging from $1.7 million to $1.3  million, depending on when Cargill notifies American Crystal of its intention to exercise its option.  The Cooperative would also be required to pay to American Crystal a capital adjustment in an amount equal to 1% of the portion of costs that have not been paid by Cargill to ProGold through additional rent with respect to certain projects at the facility.  In the event Cargill intends to exercise its option, before exercising such option, Cargill and the Cooperative will expeditiously and in good faith work together to finalize agreements for the structure, governance and operation of ProGold according to certain operational principles and other guideline terms as provided in a Memorandum of Understanding attached to the Consent Agreement. 
 The wet-milling facility was built in 1995.  As processing facilities age, more extensive maintenance becomes necessary to keep the facility in good working order.  ProGold has agreed to pay at least $750,000 annually throughout the term of the lease for infrastructure maintenance and may also be required to pay additional sums in order to make certain capital improvements.   The payments will reduce any income available for ProGold’s members at the time of such expenses.  The Cooperative and American Crystal would experience any such reduction in ProGold’s income proportionately based on their percentage ownership of ProGold.
 Seasonality
 Cargill operates the ProGold processing plant year-around but the facility only has enough corn storage on-site for approximately five days of operations.  Corn deliveries to the facility are typically required four or five days each week of the year.  Farmers harvest corn in October and November, although weather conditions have occasionally delayed harvest for some farmers into winter or spring.  Corn can be stored in storage facilities for a long period of time after it is harvested.
 The Cooperative does not control when members deliver corn to Cargill for processing at the facility.  Some of members may elect to deliver higher volumes of corn immediately following harvest in October and November, while others prefer to deliver at times when local market prices are higher, typically in the spring and late summer months.  Corn price contracts that members and Cargill enter into each year typically anticipate these delivery trends and incent members to store their corn on their farms until fewer farmers wish to deliver to the plant.  As a result, while there is some seasonality to corn deliveries, members deliver corn every week of the year, and the Cooperative monitors and makes payments for those deliveries every week.

 Intellectual Property Rights
 The Cooperative does not hold any patents.  To the extent it develops proprietary information or rights, the Cooperative will rely on a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Research and Development
 As a commodity-based business, the Cooperative does not conduct any research and development activities associated with either the development of new products or the development of new technologies for use in producing those products. Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, the Cooperative had 1 full-time employee, Executive Vice President, Scott Stofferahn, who serves in the capacity of chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Legal Proceedings
 The Cooperative is not currently involved in any legal proceedings.  In addition, we are not aware of any potential claims that could result in the commencement of legal proceedings.  The Cooperative carries insurance that provides protection against certain types of claims, up to policy limits. Competition
 As a grower-owned cooperative whose members are contractually obligated to deliver corn, the Cooperative generally does not face competition in the market place for corn.  More importantly, its governing documents and contractual arrangements with Cargill contain contractual incentives for growers to deliver corn to the Cooperative and not to another processor.  Even if members do not fully satisfy their delivery commitments, there are sufficient supplies of corn to be purchased in the open market to meet any contract obligations to Cargill, with any costs to be charged to the defaulting member.
 The Cooperative was formed in 1994 by a group of corn growers with a goal of adding value to the corn they delivered for processing.  Members invested in the Cooperative with the goal of creating a facility where they could not only find a certain market for their corn but where they could also benefit from a long term investment in a value added enterprise such as the ProGold facility.  There is no competition in attracting members to the Cooperative and its services.  Other grain shippers and corn processing facilities in the region provide competition for the purchase of corn from members, but most do not provide the opportunity for membership or partial ownership and any resulting additional profits from the operation or lease of their facilities.
