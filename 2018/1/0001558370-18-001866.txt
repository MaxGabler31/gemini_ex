 Item 1. Business
     Overview 
     We are a dermatologist-led biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing innovative and differentiated therapies to address significant unmet needs in medical and aesthetic dermatology and immunology.  Our lead product, ESKATA (hydrogen peroxide) topical solution, 40% (w/w), or ESKATA, is a proprietary formulation of high-concentration hydrogen peroxide topical solution that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as a prescription treatment for raised seborrheic keratosis, or SK, a common non-malignant skin tumor.  The FDA approved our New Drug Application, or NDA, for ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs in December 2017, making ESKATA the first drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of raised SKs.  We also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for ESKATA in the European Union in July 2017.  We are also developing another high-concentration formulation of hydrogen peroxide, A-101 45% Topical Solution, as a prescription treatment for common warts, also known as verruca vulgaris.  Additionally, in 2015, we in-licensed exclusive, worldwide rights to certain inhibitors of the Janus kinase, or JAK, family of enzymes, for specified dermatological conditions, including alopecia areata, or AA, as well as vitiligo and androgenetic alopecia, or AGA, also known as male or female pattern baldness.  In 2016, we acquired additional intellectual property rights for the development and commercialization of certain JAK inhibitors for specified dermatological conditions.  We intend to continue to in-license or acquire additional drug candidates and technologies to build a fully integrated dermatology company.  
     SK lesions are among the most common non-malignant skin tumors and one of the most frequent diagnoses made by dermatologists. SK lesions typically have a waxy, scaly, slightly elevated appearance, and multiple lesions are often present. Though the lesions are non-malignant, patients often elect to have their condition treated by a dermatologist, either because the lesions have become inflamed or because the patient feels they are cosmetically unattractive.  SK lesions are usually treated by cryosurgery, electrodesiccation, curettage or excision. Each of these methods may be painful or can result in pigmentary changes or scarring at the treatment site.  
     We are developing our sales, marketing and product distribution capabilities for ESKATA in order to support a commercial product launch in the United States, which we expect to occur in the second quarter of 2018.  We have also hired a targeted sales force of 50 sales representatives which we believe will allow us to reach the approximately 6,000 health care providers in the United States with the highest potential for using ESKATA.  A study published in the Journal of The American Academy of Dermatology in 2006, which we refer to as the AAD study, estimated that SK affects over 83 million people in the United States. Based on a market survey we commissioned in 2014, we estimate that there are 18.5 million patient visits to dermatologists for SK and dermatologists perform approximately 8.3 million procedures to remove SK lesions annually in the United States. We estimate that the cost of these procedures to third-party payors and patients is more than $1.2 billion annually.  
     We are developing A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts.  Although common warts are generally not harmful and in most cases eventually clear without medical treatment, they may be painful and aesthetically unattractive and are contagious.  On an annual basis, approximately 2.0 million people are diagnosed with common warts.  As with SK lesions, cryosurgery is the most frequently used in-office treatment for common warts.  Common warts can also be removed with slow-acting, over-the-counter products containing salicylic acid.  No prescription drugs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of common warts.  In January 2018, we reported top line results from two Phase 2 clinical trials of A-101 45% Topical Solution, WART-202 and WART-203, to assess the dose frequency in adult and pediatric patients with common warts.  In these trials, we observed clinically and statistically significant outcomes for all primary and secondary endpoints of each trial.  Based on these results, we expect to initiate Phase 3 clinical trials of A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts in the second half of 2018.  Patients in both Phase 2 trials are continuing in a 3-month drug-free follow-up phase of these trials.  We expect to report data from the Phase 3 clinical trials of A-101 45% Topical Solution in the second half of 2019 and, if positive, submit an NDA to the FDA.

 We are developing our JAK inhibitor drug candidates, ATI-501, formerly ATI-50001, and ATI-502, formerly ATI-50002, which we in-licensed from Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Rigel, as potential treatments for AA. AA is an autoimmune dermatologic condition typically characterized by patchy non-scarring hair loss on the scalp and body. More severe forms of AA include total scalp hair loss, known as alopecia totalis, or AT, and total hair loss on the scalp and body, known as alopecia universalis, or AU.  AA affects up to 2.0% of people globally at some point during their lifetime (i.e. incidence) and up to 0.2% of people are affected at any given time (i.e. prevalence) - with two-thirds of affected individuals being 30 years old or younger at the time of disease onset. Treatment options for the less severe, patchy forms of AA include corticosteroids, either topically applied or injected directly into the scalp where the bare patches are located, or the induction of an allergic reaction at the site of hair loss using a topical contact sensitizing agent, an approach known as topical immunotherapy. The same treatment options are utilized for the more severe forms of AA, although utilization of these treatment options for the more severe forms of AA is limited due to limited efficacy, certain side effects, and their impracticality for extensive surface areas.  We are also developing ATI-502 for the treatment of vitiligo and another series of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of AGA. 
     In August 2017, we acquired Confluence Life Sciences, Inc. or Confluence.  The acquisition of Confluence added small molecule drug discovery and preclinical development capabilities that allow us to bring early-stage research and development activities in-house that we previously outsourced to third parties.  Through the acquisition of Confluence, we also acquired several preclinical drug candidates, including additional JAK inhibitors known as “soft” JAK inhibitors, inhibitors of the MK-2 signaling pathway and inhibitors of interleukin-2-inducible T cell kinase, or ITK.  We expect to submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the FDA for ATI-450, an MK-2 inhibitor, in mid-2019, and for our soft JAK inhibitors and ITK inhibitors in the second half of 2019.  
     Our intellectual property portfolio contains issued patents directed to methods of use for high-concentration hydrogen peroxide compositions of at least 23% or more hydrogen peroxide, including ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution and issued patents directed to our JAK inhibitor drug candidates, ATI-501 and ATI-502.  Our issued patents relating to the use of A-101 high-concentration hydrogen peroxide compositions including ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution, begin to expire in 2022, subject to any applicable patent term extension that may be available in a particular country. Our intellectual property portfolio also contains an issued U.S. patent, European and other foreign country patent applications directed to, among other things, formulations and methods of use for high concentration hydrogen peroxide compositions, including ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution and a single-use, self-contained, pre-filled, disposable pen-type applicator for use with such formulations.  The issued U.S. formulation patent expires in 2035 and the pending U.S., European and other foreign country formulation patent applications, if they issue as patents, would also be expected to expire in 2035, subject to any applicable patent term adjustment or extension that may be available in a particular country. With respect to our JAK inhibitor drug candidates ATI-501 and ATI-502, the issued U.S. and foreign patents that specifically cover the composition of matter for these compounds begin to expire in 2030, subject to any applicable patent term extension that may be available in a particular country. Our intellectual property portfolio also contains issued patents and pending applications directed to, among other things, the use of JAK inhibitors for treating hair loss disorders that expire, or are expected to expire, in 2031, subject to any applicable patent term adjustment or extension that may be available in a particular country.

 Our Drug Candidates 
     We have utilized our experience to establish a pipeline of drug candidates that we believe will address significant unmet needs in dermatology and immunology.  Our pipeline of drug candidates is summarized in the table below:

 ESKATA for the Treatment of Raised Seborrheic Keratosis 
     ESKATA, our lead product, is the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of raised SKs.  SK lesions typically have a waxy, scaly, slightly elevated appearance, and multiple lesions are often present.  The lesions can vary in color from light tan to dark brown or black and typically appear on the face, trunk and extremities.  Though the lesions are non-malignant, patients often elect to have their condition treated by a dermatologist, either because the lesions have become inflamed or because the patient feels they are cosmetically unattractive.  
     In November 2016, we completed two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of ESKATA in a combined 937 patients who each had a total of four target SK lesions located on the face, trunk and extremities.  Each trial met all primary and secondary endpoints for that trial, achieving clinically and statistically significant clearance of SK lesions. Additionally, we completed an open-label safety trial of ESKATA in November 2016, in which we enrolled 147 subjects.  Across all three clinical trials, there were no treatment-related serious adverse events among patients treated with ESKATA, and the most common adverse events reported were nasopharyngitis and sinusitis which were determined to be unrelated to ESKATA.  Based on these results, we submitted an NDA for ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs to the FDA in February 2017, and the NDA was approved by the FDA in December 2017.  We also submitted an MAA in the European Union for ESKATA in July 2017.  
     We are developing our sales, marketing and product distribution capabilities for ESKATA in order to support a commercial product launch in the United States, which we expect to occur in the second quarter of 2018.  We have also hired a targeted sales force of 50 sales representatives which we believe will allow us to reach the approximately 6,000 health care providers in the United States with the highest potential for prescribing ESKATA to their patients.  
         A-101 45% Topical Solution for Treatment of Common Warts
     We are developing A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts.  Although common warts are generally not harmful and in most cases eventually clear without medical treatment, they may be painful and aesthetically unattractive and are contagious.  On an annual basis, approximately 2.0 million people are diagnosed with common warts. As with SK lesions, cryosurgery is the most frequently used in-office treatment for common warts.  Common warts can also be removed with slow-acting, over-the-counter products containing salicylic acid.  No prescription drugs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of common warts.  We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial, WART-201, in August 2016 evaluating 40% and 45% concentrations of A-101 for the treatment of common warts, in which we observed statistically significant improvements in the mean change in the Physician’s Wart Assessment, or PWA, score and in complete clearance of common warts in patients treated with the 45% concentration of A-101 compared to placebo.  The PWA score is a four-point scale of the investigators assessment of the severity of a target wart at a particular time point.  
     In June 2017, we commenced two additional Phase 2 clinical trials, WART-202 and WART-203, of A-101 45% Topical Solution to assess the dose frequency in adult and pediatric patients with common warts.  Both trials evaluated the safety and efficacy of A-101 45% as compared to placebo, or vehicle.  The two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials were designed to understand the effects of dose frequency and to explore additional clinical endpoints that will be further evaluated in a planned Phase 3 development program.  We enrolled a total of 316 patients at 34 investigational centers in the United States across both trials.  In January 2018, we reported top line results from these two Phase 2 clinical trials of A-101 45% Topical Solution.  The results demonstrated clinically and statistically significant outcomes for primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints, analyzed to date, of each of the two additional Phase 2 trials.  There were no treatment-related serious adverse events among patients treated with A-101 45% Topical Solution.  
     The WART-202 trial evaluated 157 patients who self-administered either A-101 45% Topical Solution or placebo once weekly through Day 56, for a total of 8 treatments.  Each patient had between one and four warts at baseline. The trial achieved its primary endpoint, which was mean change from baseline in the PWA score of the target wart at Day 56 (one week after the last treatment).  The mean reduction in PWA score at Day 56 on the target warts was 0.77 points in patients who received A-101 45% Topical Solution, compared to a reduction of 0.23 points for the target warts that received placebo, a result that was also statistically significant (p<0.001).  
     The WART-203 trial evaluated 159 patients who self-administered either A-101 45% Topical Solution or placebo twice weekly through Day 56, for a total of 16 treatments.  Each patient had between one and six warts at baseline.  The

WART-203 trial achieved its primary endpoint, which was mean change from baseline in the PWA scale score at Day 56 (Visit 10 or one week after the last treatment).  The mean reduction in PWA score at Day 56 on the target warts was 0.87 points in patients who received A-101 45%, compared to a reduction of 0.17 points for the target warts that received placebo, a result that was statistically significant (p<0.001).  
     Patients in both Phase 2 trials, WART-202 and WART-203, are continuing in a 3-month drug-free follow-up phase of these trials.  Based on the results of these Phase 2 clinical trials, we expect to initiate Phase 3 clinical trials of A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts in the second half of 2018.  We expect to report data from these Phase 3 clinical trials of A-101 45% Topical Solution in the second half of 2019 and, if positive, submit an NDA to the FDA.  
     ATI-501 and ATI-502
     We are developing the JAK inhibitors, ATI-501 and ATI-502, which we in-licensed from Rigel as potential treatments for AA. AA is an autoimmune dermatologic condition typically characterized by patchy non-scarring hair loss on the scalp and body.  More severe forms of AA include AT, which is total scalp hair loss, and AU, which is total hair loss on the scalp and body.  AA affects up to 2.0% of people globally at some point during their lifetime (i.e. incidence) and up to 0.2% of people are affected at any given time (i.e. prevalence) - with two-thirds of affected individuals being 30 years old or younger at the time of disease onset. Treatment options for the less severe, patchy forms of AA include corticosteroids, either topically applied or injected directly into the scalp where the bare patches are located, or the induction of an allergic reaction at the site of hair loss using a topical contact sensitizing agent, an approach known as topical immunotherapy.  The same treatment options are utilized for the more severe forms of AA, although utilization of these treatment options for the more severe forms of AA is limited due to limited efficacy, certain side effects, and their impracticality for extensive surface areas. 
     We are developing ATI-501 as an oral treatment for AA.  We submitted an IND to the FDA for ATI-501 in October 2016, and we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic, or PK/PD, properties of this drug candidate in the first quarter of 2017.  
     We are developing ATI-502 as a topical treatment for AA, vitiligo, AGA and loss of eyebrow hair.  We submitted an IND to the FDA for ATI-502 for the treatment of AA in July 2017.  We are also developing another series of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of AGA.  The following table summarizes the status of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials of ATI-501 and ATI-502, including their indications, trial objectives and expected timing for initiation and receipt of preliminary results:

 Manufacturing and Supply 
     We do not have any manufacturing facilities.  We rely on third parties for the manufacture of preclinical and clinical supplies for all of our drug candidates.  We also rely on third parties for the commercial manufacture of ESKATA.  We have entered into an exclusive, ten-year, automatically renewable supply agreement with PeroxyChem LLC, or PeroxyChem, which goes into effect on the date of first commercial sale of ESKATA, to provide hydrogen peroxide, the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, that can be used in ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs and a number of other specified dermatological indications.  We or PeroxyChem may terminate the supply agreement with prior written notice immediately for specified financial reasons, after a 10-day and 60-day cure period for material monetary and non-monetary material breaches, respectively, and in the event of a force majeure event, that continues for 90 consecutive days. In addition, we may terminate the PeroxyChem supply agreement, with prior written notice, for PeroxyChem's failure to supply API to us for more than 90 cumulative days in a year.  
     We have entered into an exclusive commercial supply agreement with James Alexander Corporation, or James Alexander, for the manufacture of the finished dosage form of ESKATA.  We must meet a minimum purchase requirement each year between 2018 and 2022.  Additionally, during the term of the agreement, James Alexander will not manufacture any competitive product, as defined in the agreement. In the event that we do not meet the purchase minimum requirements James Alexander’s exclusivity obligation will cease.  The term of the agreement with James Alexander is five years from the date of the first commercial sale of ESKATA and thereafter will be renewed automatically for one-year periods. Either party may terminate the agreement for any reason upon 180 days prior written notice. In addition, either party has the right to immediately terminate the supply agreement under certain circumstances including (i) the other party files for bankruptcy, (ii) the other party materially breaches the supply agreement and such breach is not cured within a specified period and (iii) any required license, permit or certificate required of the other party to perform its obligations under the supply agreement is not approved or issued or is revoked by an applicable governmental regulatory authority.  
     Replacement of any of these third-party manufacturers would require us to qualify new manufacturers and negotiate and execute contractual agreements with them. If any of our supply or service agreements with third-party manufacturers are terminated, we will experience delays and additional expenses in the commercialization of ESKATA. 
     Commercialization 
     We are planning to commercialize ESKATA ourselves in the United States, and to establish collaborations with third parties to commercialize it outside the United States, if approved.  We are developing our sales, marketing and product distribution capabilities for ESKATA, and we have hired a targeted sales force of 50 sales representatives, in order to support a commercial product launch in the United States, which we expect to occur in the second quarter of 2018.  We believe a scientifically oriented, customer-focused team of 50 sales representatives will allow us to reach the approximately 6,000 health care providers in the United States with the highest potential for prescribing ESKATA to their patients.  We estimate these health care providers will continue to account for over 70% of in-office SK treatments performed in the United States.  Our sales force will be supported by sales and marketing management, internal sales and marketing, a direct-to-consumer advertising campaign, and commercial product distribution.  
     We believe dermatologists will be inclined to adopt ESKATA to treat their patients with SK lesions not only because of its clinical profile, but also because it may provide an expanded source of revenue for their practices. Dermatologists expect declining reimbursements from third-party payors for providing medical services. In addition, a greater portion of the cost of medical care has been shifted to patients, in the form of higher deductibles and co‑insurance. Collecting from patients can be difficult and costly for physician practices. We believe many dermatologists are interested in expanding the cash-pay aesthetic portion of their practices, meaning the portion of procedures that are not medically necessary and not reimbursed by third-party payors, by treating new aesthetic patients and by offering new services to current aesthetic patients. Though SK patients typically come into the dermatology practice seeking a medical diagnosis, we believe they often are willing to pay for removal of SK lesions to improve appearance even after they learn that the lesions are non-malignant, and that removal may not be reimbursed. In addition, since ESKATA can be administered by non-physician staff, we believe it could provide incremental practice revenue with minimal time commitment by the dermatologist after the diagnosis is made. 
     We believe dermatologists tend to be particularly focused on the safety of pharmaceutical products because, while skin diseases can have profound effects on patients' quality of life, few are life-threatening. As a result, we believe that dermatologists, as well as their patients, often prefer to use topical treatments when possible to limit the risk of systemic 

 
  9

 
side effects. Dermatologists also tend to place a high level of emphasis on products that are easy to use because they often manage high volumes of patients. We believe this also contributes to a general preference for topical treatments. Finally, in our experience, dermatologists tend to engage with sales and medical affairs personnel from the pharmaceutical industry regarding the scientific evidence supporting dermatology products and the challenges experienced by physicians and patients in the use of these products. Dermatologists often rely on trusted relationships with scientifically oriented, customer-focused sales representatives who can provide them with the necessary information to support their use of appropriate treatments. 
     Competition
     The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that may become available in the future. 
     The key competitive factors affecting the success of ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, non-invasiveness, pain profile and ability to be administered by non-physician staff.  With respect to ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs, we are aware of the following companies that are developing treatments for SK: BioLineRx Ltd. is developing an over-the-counter drug candidate targeting multiple skin conditions, including SK; Skincential Sciences, Inc. currently markets a line of cosmetic products targeting skin conditions, including SK; and Epipharm, AG is developing a topical drug candidate targeting multiple skin conditions, including SK.  We are also aware of early research being conducted with Akt inhibitors as a potential treatment for SK. None of these products have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of SK in the United States.  
     With respect to A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts, we are aware of the following companies that are developing treatments for common warts: Nielsen BioSciences, Inc. is developing a drug candidate for the treatment of common warts; BioLineRx Ltd. is developing an over-the-counter drug candidate targeting multiple skin conditions, including common warts; Cutanea Lifesciences, Inc. is developing a drug candidate for the treatment of common warts; and RXi Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is also developing a drug candidate for the treatment of common warts. In addition, other drugs have been used off-label as treatments for common warts. We could also encounter competition from over-the-counter treatments for common warts.  
     With respect to ATI-501 and ATI-502 for the treatment of AA, we anticipate competing with sensitizing agents such as diphencyprone, and topical, intralesional and systemic corticosteroids, which have been found to occasionally reduce symptoms of AA. Other treatments utilized for patchy AA include anthralin and minoxidil solution. We may also compete with companies developing chemical agents to be used in topical immunotherapies, as well as companies developing biologics, immunosuppressive agents, laser therapy, phototherapy, other JAK inhibitors and prostaglandin analogues to treat AA. 
     Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than ESKATA or any other drug that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our drug candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Many of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs.

 Intellectual Property 
     Our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We seek to avoid the latter by monitoring patents and publications that may affect our business, and to the extent we identify such developments, evaluate and take appropriate courses of action. Our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing for patent applications on inventions that are important to the development and conduct of our business with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and its foreign counterparts. 
     With respect to ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution, we do not currently rely on licenses to any third party's intellectual property. We own two U.S. patents that include claims that cover the use of high-concentration hydrogen peroxide of at least 23%, including ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution, for the alleviation of SK and acrochordons. The patents in Australia, New Zealand and India include claims that cover the use of high-concentration hydrogen peroxide of at least 23%, including ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution, for the alleviation of various skin conditions including SK, acrochordons, corns, tags, acne, warts and rosacea. The patents in Germany, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Singapore include claims that cover the use of high-concentration hydrogen peroxide of at least 23%, including ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution for the alleviation of acrochordons. The issued patents relating to the use of ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution begin to expire in 2022, subject to any applicable patent term extension that may be available in a particular country.  
     We also own one issued U.S. patent and pending U.S., European and other foreign patent applications directed to various formulations comprising high-concentration hydrogen peroxide, including ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution dosing regimens for such formulations, applicators for use with such formulations, and methods of treating various skin conditions, including SK and common warts, by the topical administration of such formulations.  Our U.S. formulation patent expires in 2035 and any claims that issue from the pending formulation applications will expire in 2035, subject to any applicable patent term adjustment or extension that may be available in a particular country.  In addition, we own a U.S. and PCT patent application directed to the use of high-concentration hydrogen peroxide, including ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution, for the treatment of warts.  Any claims that issue from these applications will expire in 2037, subject to any applicable patent term adjustment or extension that may be available in a particular country.
     With respect to ATI-501 and ATI-502, we exclusively licensed from Rigel multiple families of patents and applications relating to these compounds and the uses thereof in the field of dermatology.  In particular, we exclusively licensed patents and applications with claims that specifically cover the composition of matter for these compounds in the United States, the European Union, and other major foreign markets. The issued patents specifically directed to these compounds begin to expire in 2030, subject to any applicable patent term extension that may be available in a particular country. We also exclusively licensed an issued U.S. patent and pending applications in the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union and Japan with claims that cover the use of these compounds for the treatment of alopecia areata.  The U.S. patent, and any claims that issue from these applications, expire, or will expire, in 2034, subject to any applicable patent term adjustment or extension that may be available in a particular country. We also licensed a family of patents and applications that relate to ATI-501 and ATI-502 that expire in 2023, subject to any applicable patent term extension that may be available in a particular country. 
     We also exclusively licensed patents and applications from Columbia University relating to the use of JAK inhibitors to induce hair growth and treat hair loss disorders, including AA and AGA.  In particular, we exclusively licensed multiple U.S. patents with claims directed to the use of certain third-party JAK inhibitors for the treatment of hair loss disorders, including AA and AGA, and inducing hair growth, which expires in 2031.  We also exclusively licensed patents and applications with claims directed to the use of certain JAK1, JAK2 or JAK3 inhibitors for the treatment of hair loss disorders, including AA and AGA, and inducing hair growth in the U.S., the European Union, Japan and South Korea.  Any claims that issue from the pending applications begin to expire in 2031, subject to any applicable patent term adjustment or extension that may be available in a particular country.  In addition, we exclusively licensed patent applications in the United States and other foreign countries directed to methods of inducing hair growth with JAK1, JAK2 or JAK3 inhibitors as well as biomarkers for AA, which if claims issue, would expire in 2036, subject to any applicable patent term adjustment or extension that may be available in a particular country. 
     With respect to our inhibitors of the MK-2 signaling pathway, we own one U.S. patent and pending applications in the European Union and other foreign countries that cover our lead candidate.  The U.S. patent expires in 2034 and any claims that issue from the pending applications expire in 2034, subject to any applicable patent term adjustment or

extension that may be available in a particular country.  We also own six U.S. patents and pending foreign patent applications directed to other inhibitors of the MK-2 signaling pathway, which expire or will expire in 2031 and 2032, subject to any applicable patent term adjustment or extension that may be available in a particular country.  
     With respect to our “soft” JAK inhibitors, we have filed a number of provisional applications directed to various novel inhibitors of JAK1 and/or JAK3 and methods of using the same.  Any claims that may issue would expire in 2038, subject to any applicable patent term adjustment or extension that may be available in a particular country.
     With respect to our ITK inhibitors, we own multiple U.S. patents and pending applications in the United States and foreign countries directed to novel inhibitors of ITK and methods of using the same.  The patents and pending applications, if issued, expire between 2035 and 2038, subject to any applicable patent term adjustment or extension that may be available in a particular country.
     We also use other forms of protection, such as trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection, to protect our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We aim to take advantage of all of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and believe that this comprehensive approach will provide us with proprietary positions for our drug candidates, where available.
     Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in patent prosecution by the patentee, and a patent's term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent or by patent term extension, which compensates a patentee for delays at the FDA. The patent term of a European patent is 20 years from its filing date; however, unlike in the United States, the European patent does not grant patent term adjustments. The European Union does have a compensation program similar to patent term extension called supplementary patent certificate that would effectively extend patent protection for up to five years. 
     We also protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. In addition, we also require confidentiality or service agreements from third parties that receive our confidential information or materials. 
     Assignment Agreement and Finder's Services Agreement 
     In August 2012, we entered into an assignment agreement with the Estate of Mickey Miller, or the Miller Estate, under which we acquired some of the intellectual property rights covering ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution.  The assignment of intellectual property rights covers specified know-how, along with modifications of, improvements to and variations on A-101 that meet defined chemical properties. Under the agreement, we have the sole and exclusive right, but not the duty, to develop, obtain marketing approval for and commercialize ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution in various countries throughout the world. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product for at least one indication in the United States. In connection with obtaining the assignment of the intellectual property from the Miller Estate, we also entered into a separate finder's services agreement with KPT Consulting, LLC.  
     Under the terms of the assignment agreement and the finder's services agreement, we made aggregate upfront payments of $0.6 million in 2012 and one-time milestone payments of $0.4 million in 2013 upon the dosing of the first human subject with ESKATA in our Phase 2 clinical trial. There are no remaining potential milestone payments under the assignment agreement. Under the finder's services agreement, we made a one-time milestone payment of $0.3 million in February 2016 upon the dosing of the first human subject with ESKATA in our Phase 3 clinical trial, and a one-time milestone payment of $1.0 million in April 2017 upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones.  We are obligated to make additional milestone payments up to an aggregate of $4.5 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones.  Under each of the assignment agreement and the finder's services agreement, we are also obligated to pay royalties on sales of ESKATA or related products, at low single-digit percentages

of net sales, subject to reduction in specified circumstances. We have not made any royalty payments to date under either agreement. Both agreements will terminate upon the expiration of the last pending, viable patent claim of the patents acquired under the assignment agreement, but no sooner than 15 years from the effective date of the agreements. 
     License Agreement with Rigel 
     In August 2015, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Rigel for the development and commercialization of products containing two specified JAK inhibitors, ATI-501 and ATI-502. Under this agreement, we intend to develop these JAK inhibitors for the treatment of AA and potentially for other dermatological conditions. We paid Rigel an upfront non-refundable payment of $8.0 million and have agreed to make aggregate payments of up to $80.0 million upon the achievement of specified pre-commercialization milestones, such as clinical trials and regulatory approvals. Further, we have agreed to pay up to an additional $10.0 million to Rigel upon the achievement of a second set of development milestones. With respect to any products we commercialize under the agreement, we will pay Rigel quarterly tiered royalties on our annual net sales of each product at a high single-digit percentage of annual net sales, subject to specified reductions, until the date that all of the patent rights for that product have expired, as determined on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis or, in specified countries under specified circumstances, ten years from the first commercial sale of such product. 
     The agreement terminates on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations unless earlier terminated by either party for a material breach. We may also terminate the agreement without cause at any time upon advance written notice to Rigel. Rigel, after consultation with us, will be responsible for maintaining and prosecuting the patent rights, and we will have final decision-making authority regarding such patent rights for a product in the United States and the European Union. To the extent that we jointly develop intellectual property, we will confer and decide which party will be responsible for filing, prosecuting and maintaining those patent rights. The agreement also establishes a joint steering committee composed of an equal number of representatives for each party, which will monitor progress of the development of products. 
     Stock Purchase Agreement with Vixen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
     On March 24, 2016, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Vixen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Vixen, and JAK1, LLC, JAK2, LLC and JAK3, LLC, all together with Vixen, the Selling Stockholders, and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, solely in its capacity as the representative of the Selling Stockholders.  Pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, we acquired all shares of Vixen’s capital stock from the Selling Stockholders, the Vixen Acquisition.  Following the Vixen Acquisition, Vixen became a wholly-owned subsidiary of us.  Pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, we paid $0.6 million upfront and issued an aggregate of 159,420 shares of our common stock to the Selling Stockholders. We are obligated to make annual payments of $0.1 million on March 24th of each year, through March 2022, with such amounts being creditable against specified future payments that may be paid under the stock purchase agreement.
     Under the stock purchase agreement, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product for the treatment of AA in humans and at least one product for the treatment of AGA in humans, in each case for commercial sale and distribution throughout the United States and such other areas of the world as we determine to be commercially prudent.  In the event we do not comply with these obligations, we are obligated to license, on a non-exclusive basis, certain intellectual property rights related to the products to the Selling Stockholders or their designee, on terms to be mutually agreed to by the parties, among other rights exercisable by the Selling Stockholders. 
     We are obligated to make aggregate payments of up to $18.0 million to the Selling Stockholders upon the achievement of specified pre-commercialization milestones for three products in the United States, the European Union and Japan, and aggregate payments of up to $22.5 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones. With respect to any commercialized products covered by the stock purchase agreement, we are obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on net sales, subject to specified reductions, limitations and other adjustments, until the date that all of the patent rights for that product have expired, as determined on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis or, in specified circumstances, ten years from the first commercial sale of such product. If we sublicense any of Vixen’s patent rights and know-how acquired pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, we will be obligated to pay a portion of any consideration we receive from such sublicenses in specified circumstances.

     License Agreement with Columbia University        As a result of the Vixen Acquisition, we became party to the Exclusive License Agreement, by and between Vixen and the Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York, or Columbia, dated as of December 31, 2015, or the Columbia License Agreement.  Pursuant to the Columbia License Agreement, Vixen was granted an exclusive, worldwide license under specified Columbia patent rights and a non-exclusive, worldwide license under specified Columbia know-how in all fields to develop and commercialize a product that otherwise infringes a Columbia patent right or uses Columbia know-how.  Vixen’s rights to this Columbia intellectual property cover the use of specified JAK inhibitor compounds for the potential treatment of AA, AGA and other dermatological conditions.  
     We are obligated to pay Columbia an annual license fee of $10,000, subject to specified adjustments for patent expenses incurred by Columbia and creditable against any royalties that may be paid under the Columbia License Agreement. We are also obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $11.6 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones, including specified levels of net sales of products covered by Columbia patent rights and/or know-how, and royalties at a sub-single-digit percentage of annual net sales of products covered by Columbia patent rights and/or know-how, subject to specified adjustments. If we sublicense any of Columbia’s patent rights and know-how acquired pursuant to the Columbia License Agreement, we will be obligated to pay Columbia a portion of any consideration received from such sublicenses in specified circumstances.  The royalties, as determined on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, are payable until the date that all of the patent rights for that product have expired, the expiration of any market exclusivity period granted by a regulatory body or, in specified circumstances, ten years from the first commercial sale of such product. 
     We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product. In the event we do not comply with this obligation, Columbia has the option to terminate the license or convert the exclusive patent license to a non-exclusive patent license. Further, in the event we do not comply with our obligations under the Vixen stock purchase agreement to develop and commercialize products, our rights under the Columbia License Agreement may revert to a party to be designated by the Selling Stockholders.  Columbia is responsible for maintaining and prosecuting the patent rights, giving due consideration to our reasonable comments related thereto.
     The Columbia License Agreement terminates on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations thereunder unless earlier terminated by either party for a material breach, subject to a specified cure period. We may also terminate the Columbia License Agreement without cause at any time upon advance written notice to Columbia.
     Agreement and Plan of Merger with Confluence
     In August 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Confluence, Aclaris Life Sciences, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, or Merger Sub, and Fortis Advisors LLC, as representative of the equity holders of Confluence, or the Agreement and Plan of Merger.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the Merger Sub merged with and into Confluence, with Confluence surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aclaris, resulting in our acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Confluence.  Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, we gave aggregate consideration with a fair value of $24.3 million to the equity holders of Confluence.  
     We also agreed to pay the Confluence equity holders aggregate contingent consideration of up to $80.0 million, based upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger.  Of the contingent consideration, $2.5 million may be paid in shares of our common stock upon the achievement of a specified development milestone.  In addition, we have agreed to pay the Confluence equity holders specified future royalty payments calculated as a low single-digit percentage of annual net sales, subject to specified reductions, limitations and other adjustments, until the date that all of the patent rights for that product have expired, as determined on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis or, in specified circumstances, ten years from the first commercial sale of such product.  In addition, if we sell, license or transfer any of the intellectual property acquired from Confluence pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger to a third party, we will be obligated to pay the Confluence equity holders a portion of any incremental consideration (in excess of the development and milestone payments described above) that we receive from such sale, license or transfer in specified circumstances.

 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
     Governmental authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and analogous authorities in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, safety surveillance, efficacy, quality control, labeling, packaging, distribution, record keeping, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing, sale, export and import, and the reporting of safety and other post-market information of products such as the one we are developing. A drug candidate must be approved by the FDA before it may be legally promoted in the United States and by comparable foreign regulatory authorities before marketing in other jurisdictions.  The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by regulatory authorities to approve applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, import/export delays, issuance of warning letters and untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.      United States Government Regulation 
     NDA Approval Processes 
     In the United States, the FDA regulates drug and medical device products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Certain of our drug candidates are comprised of both a drug component (the hydrogen peroxide solution or gel) and a pen-type applicator. In the case of our drug candidates, the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval of our drug candidates. Accordingly, we are investigating our drug candidates pursuant to IND applications and expect to seek approval through the NDA pathway. Based on our discussions with the FDA to date, we do not anticipate that the FDA will require us to submit a separate marketing application for the pen-type applicator that will be used with certain of our drug candidates, but this could change during the course of the FDA's review of the respective NDA. 
     An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
    
· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's good laboratory practice regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND which must take effect before clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before clinical testing may be initiated at the clinical site;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | review of the NDA by a FDA advisory committee, if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product or its components are produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including potential requirements for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy and post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Once a drug candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or nonclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and formulation. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical studies may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the preclinical studies, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND, and may affect one or more specific clinical trials or all clinical trials conducted under the IND. 
     All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices regulations. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must timely report to FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. An institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before the clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject's legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. 
     Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
    
· | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, and especially when the product may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients who already have the condition. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. If a drug candidate is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 clinical trials, the clinical trial program will be expanded to Phase 3 clinical trials to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling claims. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Phase 4 clinical trials are conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations, or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post-market requirements or commitments. Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval. 
     Clinical trials are inherently uncertain, and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In some cases, clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, which is called the clinical monitoring board or data safety monitoring board. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points. These decisions are based on the limited access to data from the ongoing trial. 
    
 
  16

 

 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to the submission of an IND, at the end-of-Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end-of-Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical trial results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial or trials that they believe will support the approval of the new drug. 
     Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life. 
     The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted for a period of 60 days to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
     During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS, and the FDA will not approve the application without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval. The FDA could also require a special warning, known as a boxed warning, to be included in the product label in order to highlight a particular safety risk. 
     Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. NDAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA's goal for taking action on the NDA from ten months to six months from FDA filing of the NDA. After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.

 Post-approval Requirements 
     Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and other governmental agencies, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for certain supplemental applications. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 
     Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with GMP regulations and other laws. The FDA has promulgated specific requirements for drug cGMPs and device cGMPs embodied in the Quality System Regulation. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
     Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process or approval process, or after approval, may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:
    
· | refusal to approve pending applications;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | withdrawal of an approval;
--+---------------------------


· | imposition of a clinical hold;
--+-------------------------------


· | warning letters;
--+-----------------


· | product seizures or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | total or partial suspension of production or distribution or product recalls; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions, fines, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

      The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
     From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often issued revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be issued or changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

 Non-patent Exclusivity 
     The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, or NCE. A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance.  If market exclusivity is granted for an NCE, during the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review or approve an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
     The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages, dosage forms or strengths of an existing drug.  This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and prohibits the FDA from approving an ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company with overlapping conditions associated with the new clinical investigations for the three-year period.  Clinical investigation exclusivity does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of an NDA for the same drug. However, an applicant submitting an NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

 Regulation Outside of the United States 
     In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to regulations of other countries governing our business activities, including, our clinical trials and the commercial sale and distribution of our product. Even if we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly by geographic region, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
     In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is composed of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. 
     There are two types of MAs:
    
· | The Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when the authorization of a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Under the accelerated procedure, the standard 210 days review period is reduced to 150 days.

· | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure.

      In the EEA, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator's data to assess a generic application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but no generic product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union's regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.

 Other Healthcare Laws 
     Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of ESKATA and any other drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.  Our current and future arrangements with third-party payors, health care professionals and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal civil False Claims Act, that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we sell, market and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by the federal government and by the U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.
     The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, civil money penalties, administrative penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. 
     Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 
     Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to "cause" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, or for providing medically unnecessary services or items. In addition, our future activities relating to the sale and marketing of our product are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for the federal civil False Claims Act violations may include up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,957 and $21,916 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal civil False Claims Act is a civil statute, False Claims Act violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes.  For example, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for the healthcare fraud statute under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
     Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws. 
     In addition, legislation imposing marketing restrictions and transparency requirements on pharmaceutical manufacturers has been enacted at the state and federal levels.  For example, the Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $165,786 per year and up to an aggregate of $1,105,241 per year for "knowing failures."  Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices, require registration of certain employees engaged in marketing activities in the location, and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.  
     Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we intend to continue to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. Although the development and implementation of compliance programs designed to establish internal controls and facilitate compliance can mitigate the risk of investigation, prosecution, and penalties assessed for violations of these laws, or any other laws that may apply to us, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
     We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's security standards directly applicable to "business associates", namely independent contractors or agents of HIPAA covered entities that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney's fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties.

 Health Care Reform 
     In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of significant legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was passed, which has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured and at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs; addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs; made changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare prescription drug benefit; and established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers, as a condition for their outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D, must agree to offer 50% (and 70% commencing January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period.  Moreover, the Affordable Care Act provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government's comparative effectiveness research and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling meant to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services. 
     Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to, as well efforts by the Trump Administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act.  For example, since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”.  Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain Affordable Care Act-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace elements of the Affordable Care Act.  
     In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will stay in effect through 2027, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, cancer treatment centers and imaging centers. Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. 
     More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products.  At the federal level, the Trump Administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for

low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump Administration have both stated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
     The Affordable Care Act, as well as other federal and state healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, could harm our future revenue.  Additional legislative actions may be taken in the future which may change current regulations, guidance and interpretations.  The impact of such actions on our business, if any, cannot presently be determined. 
     The Hatch Waxman Amendments to the FDC Act 
     Orange Book Listing 
     In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant's product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or an application covered by Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients, generally in the same strengths and dosage form, as the listed drug and has been shown through pharmacokinetic, or PK, testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as "generic equivalents" to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Section 505(b)(2) applications provide for marketing of a drug product that may have the same active ingredients as the listed drug and contains full safety and effectiveness data as an NDA, but at least some of this information comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. This alternate regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA's findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant. 
     The ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA's Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding a patented method of use rather than certify to such listed method of use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents by filing a certification that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product, the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
     A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product's listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application until the earliest of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, and a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) applicant. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor's decision to initiate patent litigation. 
    
 
  24

 

 The ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 
     Patent Term Extension 
     In the United States, after NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five year patent extension, which provides patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process for the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug product. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug's testing phase, which is the time between the IND submission becoming effective and the NDA submission, and all of the review phase, which is the time between NDA submission and approval, up to a maximum extension of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended.  
     Similar provisions are available in the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. For example, in Japan, it may be possible to extend the patent term for up to five years and in the European Union, it may be possible to obtain a supplementary patent certificate that would effectively extend patent protection for up to five years. 
     Coverage and Reimbursement 
     We do not expect third-party payors to cover and reimburse customers who use ESKATA on patients for the treatment of raised SKs. Payors generally do not reimburse the provider for the product used to remove non-malignant lesions, including SK. In addition, they do not generally reimburse providers for the procedure removing such lesions, since the procedure is considered to be cosmetic in nature, unless there is a medical need to remove the lesion such as confirming a diagnosis with a biopsy or treating SK that are causing the patient physical discomfort. We anticipate that in some cases, ESKATA may be used to remove SK lesions that are inflamed and causing the patient discomfort. Any reduction in reimbursement for the procedure to remove inflamed SK may result in a higher percentage of patients needing to pay out of pocket for treatment with ESKATA.  Accordingly, the commercial success of ESKATA depends on the extent to which patients are willing to pay out of pocket for the in-office procedure using our product.  By contrast, in the case of A-101 45% Topical Solution, if approved, for the treatment of common warts, we believe our success will depend on continued coverage and adequate reimbursement for in-office wart treatment procedures or in the absence of coverage and adequate reimbursement, on the extent to which patients will be willing to pay out of pocket for the in-office procedures that include our product. 
     Third-party payors determine which medical procedures they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Even if a third-party payor covers a particular procedure, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate. Patients who are treated in-office for a medical condition generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with the procedure and may be unwilling to undergo such procedures for the removal of warts in the absence of such coverage and reimbursement. Physicians may be unlikely to offer procedures for the treatment of warts if they are not covered by insurance and may be unlikely to purchase and use our product for warts unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate. 
     Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including: the third-party payor's determination that a procedure is neither cosmetic, experimental, nor investigational; safe, effective, and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; supported by peer-reviewed medical journals; and included in clinical practice guidelines. 
     In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for medical procedures exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for procedures can differ significantly from payor to payor. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for an in-office procedure to remove warts are made on a plan by plan basis. One payor's determination to provide coverage for a procedure does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement. 
    

 
  25

 

 In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. To the extent the procedure using our drug candidates would be covered, the cost of our drugs generally is recovered by the healthcare provider as part of the payment for performing a procedure and not separately reimbursed. Accordingly, these updates could impact the demand for our drug candidates. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program's updates to hospital and physician payments, which are done on an annual basis using a prescribed statutory formula. In the past, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, ended the use of the statutory formula, and provided for a 0.5% annual increase in payment rates under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule through 2019, but no annual update from 2020 through 2025.  MACRA also introduced a merit based incentive bonus program for Medicare physicians beginning in 2019.  At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the merit based incentive program will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program. 
     Foreign governments also have their own healthcare reimbursement systems, which vary significantly by country and region, and we cannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be made available with respect to the treatments in which our drugs are used under any foreign reimbursement system.
