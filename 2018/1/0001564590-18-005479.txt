ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
NeoGenomics, Inc., a Nevada corporation (referred to individually as the “Parent Company” or collectively with its subsidiaries as “NeoGenomics”, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company” in this Annual Report) is the registrant for SEC reporting purposes. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “NEO”.
 Overview 
 We operate a network of cancer-focused genetic testing laboratories in the United States as well as a laboratory in Switzerland.  Our mission is to improve patient care through exceptional genetic and molecular testing services. Our vision is to become the World’s leading cancer testing and information company by delivering uncompromising quality, exceptional service and innovative solutions. 
 As of December 31, 2017, the Company has laboratory locations in Ft. Myers and Tampa, Florida; Aliso Viejo and Fresno California; Houston, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; and Rolle, Switzerland, and currently offers the following types of genetic and molecular testing services: 
  
a) | Cytogenetics - the study of normal and abnormal chromosomes and their relationship to disease. It involves looking at the chromosome structure to identify changes from patterns seen in normal chromosomes. Cytogenetic studies are often utilized to answer diagnostic, prognostic and predictive questions in the treatment of hematological malignancies.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b) | Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (“FISH”) - a branch of cancer genetics that focuses on detecting and locating the presence or absence of specific DNA sequences and genes on chromosomes. FISH helps bridge abnormality detection between the chromosomal and DNA sequence levels. The technique uses fluorescent probes that bind to only those parts of the chromosome with which they show a high degree of sequence similarity. Fluorescence microscopy is used to visualize the fluorescent probes bound to the chromosomes. FISH can be used to help identify a number of gene alternations, such as amplification, deletions, and translocations.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c) | Flow cytometry - a rapid way to measure the characteristics of cell populations. Cells from peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirate, lymph nodes, and other areas are labeled with selective fluorescent antibodies and analyzed as they flow in a fluid stream through a beam of light. The properties measured in these antibodies include the relative size, relative granularity or internal complexity, and relative fluorescence intensity. These fluorescent antibodies bind to specific cell surface antigens and are used to identify malignant cell populations. Flow cytometry is typically performed in diagnosing a wide variety of leukemia and lymphoma neoplasms. Flow cytometry is also used to monitor patients through therapy to determine whether the disease burden is increasing or decreasing, otherwise known as minimal residual disease monitoring.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


d) | Immunohistochemistry (“IHC”) and Digital Imaging – Refers to the process of localizing proteins in cells of a tissue section and relies on the principle of antibodies binding specifically to antigens in biological tissues. IHC is widely used in the diagnosis of abnormal cells such as those found in cancerous tumors. Specific surface cytoplasmic or nuclear markers are characteristic of cellular events such as proliferation or cell death (apoptosis). IHC is also widely used to understand the distribution and localization of differentially expressed proteins. Digital imaging allows clients to see and utilize scanned slides and perform quantitative analysis for certain stains. Scanned slides are received online in real time and can be previewed often a full day before the glass slides can be shipped back to clients. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


e) | Molecular testing - a rapidly growing cancer diagnostic tool focusing on the analysis of DNA and RNA, as well as the structure and function of genes at the molecular level. Molecular testing employs multiple technologies including DNA fragment length analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction (“RT-PCR”) RNA analysis, bi-directional Sanger sequencing analysis, and Next-Generation Sequencing (“NGS”).
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


f) | Pathology consultation - services provided for clients in which our pathologists review surgical samples on a consultative basis. NeoGenomics expert pathologists often assist our client pathologists on their most difficult and complex cases.

Operating Segments
 We analyzed our reporting structure in 2017, including the information available to our Chief Operating Decision Maker and the information used to make strategic decisions.  Prior to 2017, our operations were reported as one consolidated segment.  Based on our 2017 analysis and due to changes made in the fourth quarter of 2017, we began reporting our operations in two segments; Clinical Services and Pharma Services.  
 In 2017, our Clinical Services segment accounted for 90% of consolidated revenues and our Pharma Services segment accounted for 10% of our consolidated revenues.  For further financial information about these segments, see Note Q to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.
 Clinical Services Segment 
 The clinical cancer testing services we offer to community-based pathologists are designed to be a natural extension of, and complementary to, the services that they perform within their own practices. We believe our relationship as a non-competitive partner to community-based pathology practices, hospital pathology labs and academic centers empowers them to expand their breadth of testing and provide a menu of services that matches or exceeds the level of service found in any center of excellence around the world. Community-based pathology practices and hospital pathology labs may order certain testing services on a technical component only (“TC” or “tech-only”) basis, which allows them to participate in the diagnostic process by performing the professional component (“PC”) interpretation services without having to hire laboratory technologists or purchase the sophisticated equipment needed to perform the technical component of the tests. We also support our pathology clients with interpretation and consultative services using our own specialized team of pathologists for difficult or complex cases and provide overflow interpretation services when requested by clients.
 In addition, we may directly serve oncology, dermatology, urology and other clinician practices that prefer to have a direct relationship with a laboratory for cancer-related genetic and molecular testing services. We typically service these types of clients with a comprehensive service offering where we perform both the technical and professional components of the tests ordered. In certain instances larger clinician practices have begun to internalize pathology interpretation services, and our “tech-only” service offering allows these larger clinician practices to also participate in the diagnostic process by performing the PC interpretation services on TC testing performed by NeoGenomics.  In these instances NeoGenomics will typically provide all of the more complex, Molecular testing services.
 Pharma Services Segment
 Our Pharma Services segment supports pharmaceutical firms in their drug development programs by supporting various clinical trials and research.  This portion of our business often involves working with the pharmaceutical firms (sponsors) on study design as well as performing the required testing.  Our medical team often advises the sponsor and works closely with them as specimens are received from the enrolled sites.  We also work on developing tests that will be used as part of a companion diagnostic to determine patients’ response to a particular drug.  As studies unfold, our clinical trials team reports the data and often provide key analysis and insights back to the sponsors.  
 Our Pharma Services segment provides comprehensive testing services in support of our pharmaceutical clients’ oncology programs from discovery to commercialization.  In biomarker discovery, our aim is to help our customers discover the right content.  We help our customers develop a biomarker hypothesis by recommending an optimal platform for molecular screening and backing our discovery tools with the informatics to capture meaningful data.  In other pre and non-clinical work, we can use our platforms to characterize markers of interest.  Moving from discovery to development, we help our customers refine their biomarker strategy and, if applicable, develop a companion diagnostic pathway using the optimal technology for large-scale clinical trial testing. 
 Whether serving as the single contract research organization or partnering with one, our Pharma Services team provides significant technical expertise, working closely with our customers to support each stage of clinical trial

development.  Each trial we support comes with rapid turnaround time, dedicated project management and quality assurance oversight. We have experience in supporting submissions to the Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”) for companion diagnostics.  Our Pharma Services strategy is focused on helping bring more effective oncology treatments to market through providing world class laboratory services in oncology to key pharmaceutical companies in the industry.
 Our Pharma Services revenue consists of three revenue streams:
  
• | Clinical trials and research;
--+------------------------------


• | Validation laboratory services; and
--+------------------------------------


• | Data services
--+--------------

Markets
 The medical testing laboratory market can be broken down into three primary markets:
  
• | Clinical Pathology testing;
--+----------------------------


• | Anatomic Pathology testing; and
--+--------------------------------


• | Genetic and Molecular testing
--+------------------------------

 Clinical Pathology testing covers high volume, highly automated, lower complexity tests on easily procured specimens such as blood and urine. Clinical lab tests often involve testing of a less urgent nature, for example, cholesterol testing and testing associated with routine physical exams.
 Anatomic Pathology testing involves evaluation of tissue, as in surgical pathology, or cells as in cytopathology. The most widely performed Anatomic Pathology procedures include the preparation and interpretation of pap smears, skin biopsies, and tissue biopsies.
 Genetic and molecular testing typically involves analyzing chromosomes, genes, proteins and/or DNA/RNA sequences for abnormalities. Genetic and molecular testing requires highly specialized equipment and credentialed individuals (typically M.D. or Ph.D. level) to certify results and typically yields the highest reimbursement levels of the three market segments.
 NeoGenomics operates primarily in the Genetic and Molecular testing market. We also act as a reference laboratory supplying anatomic pathology testing. NeoGenomics typically does not compete in the Clinical Pathology testing market.  
 The field of cancer genetics is evolving rapidly and new tests are being developed at an accelerated pace. Based on medical and scientific discoveries over the last decade, cancer testing falls into one of three categories: diagnostic testing, prognostic testing and predictive testing. Of the three, the fastest growing area is predictive testing, which is utilized by clinicians to predict a patient’s response to the various treatment options in order to deliver “personalized or precision medicine” that is optimized to that patient’s particular circumstances. Personalized or precision medicine allows clinicians to know if a patient will or will not respond to certain medications like Herceptin, Keytruda and Opdivo. This saves the healthcare system money by ensuring that expensive cancer drugs are only given to those who will benefit from them. This type of testing improves patient care and potentially saves lives by identifying optimized therapies much more rapidly than what was possible in previous years.
 The United States market for genetic and molecular testing is divided among numerous laboratories. Many of these laboratories are attached to academic institutions and primarily provide clinical services to their affiliated university hospitals and associated physicians. 
 We believe several key factors are influencing the rapid growth in the market for cancer testing: (i) every year, more and more genes and genomic pathways are implicated in the development and/or clinical course of cancer; (ii) cancer is primarily a disease of the elderly - one in four senior citizens is likely to develop some form of cancer during the rest of their lifetime once they turn sixty, and now that the baby boomer generation has started to reach 
 6

NEOGENOMICS, INC.
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
 
this age range, the incidence rates of cancer are rising; (iii) increasingly, new drugs are being targeted to certain cancer subtypes and pathways which require companion diagnostic testing; (iv) patient and payer awareness of the value of genetic and molecular testing; (v) decreases in the cost of performing genetic and molecular testing; (vi) increased coverage from third party payers and Medicare for such testing; and (vii) the health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010. These factors have driven significant growth in the market for this type of testing. We estimate a $12-14 billion total market opportunity for cancer testing in the United States, and we estimate that about $5-7 billion of this market is made up of genetic and molecular testing with the remaining portion derived from more traditional anatomic pathology testing services that are complementary to and often ordered with the genetic and molecular testing services we offer. 
 2018 Focus Areas: Strengthen Our World-Class Culture, Provide Uncompromising Quality and Pursue Exceptional Service and Growth
 We are committed to being an innovative leader in our industry.  Over the past year, we have grown our business domestically and have expanded our presence internationally.  Our plans for 2018 include many initiatives to continue our strong organic growth by gaining market share and introducing new tests.  In addition, we expect to realize growth from the expansion of our Pharma business in Europe as well as in the United States.  We expect these initiatives to continue to position our Company to be the World’s leading cancer testing and information company.
 Strengthen Our World-Class Culture   
 Our belief is that a culture of motivated and engaged employees will deliver superior service to our clients.  We are focused on continuing to strengthen our culture by improving teamwork, which will enable our Company to work more coherently and efficiently.  We will also emphasize effective communication techniques through cross functional initiatives.  We introduced initiatives and implemented targeted dialogue between management and employees in 2017 and will continue this going forward.  Part of this initiative included selecting employees who were given the opportunity to talk to our CEO in a small group setting designed to foster two-way communication.  
 Communication is a key element in our high performance culture.  Through effective communication we facilitate our employees’ understanding of our Company’s priorities and how they contribute to the Company’s overall objectives.  We believe our employee retention rate is above average for the laboratory industry and continuing to strengthen our culture will enable us to continually recruit and retain talented employees.    
 Enhancing our culture to closely align with the values of our Company is a key priority.  We plan to implement Talent Success Profiles to develop leaders and ensure that we are creating opportunities for the development and mobility of our employees.  We will focus on mentoring and training opportunities to enhance and capitalize on the talent within our Company.  We believe these initiatives will foster a culture of accountability and empowerment.  We also believe these initiatives are necessary to ensure the success of our Company.    
 Provide Uncompromising Quality 
 Maintaining the highest quality laboratory operations and service levels has enabled us to consistently grow our business.  We have been successful in retaining clients while also gaining market share.  Our initiatives for 2018 will promote continuous process improvement to ensure that we maintain our high level of quality within our organization.  
 We plan to continue to grow a culture of quality through company-wide leadership, training and employee engagement initiatives.  Through training, we aim to empower our employees to understand the importance of quality and how to ensure quality in their respective function.  We will challenge employees to identify quality issues and find solutions and will recognize individuals and teams for providing quality service.  Through employee engagement, we will motivate our employees to exceed our client’s expectations.  
 7

NEOGENOMICS, INC.
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
 
Our laboratory teams will focus on quality by improving corrective and preventative metrics in the laboratory.  This is expected to result in increased product and process understanding, improvements in processes and increased efficiency.  We also believe these improvements will enable us to continue reducing our cost per test.   
 In 2016, we began work on our next generation Laboratory Information System, or LIS, and have implemented this system in our Pharma Services business in 2017.  We will continue to develop this system in 2018 and believe it will increase efficiency and productivity.  It also improves the quality of our services by enabling our Pharma services clients the ability to track each step through the laboratory process. 
 Pursue Exceptional Service and Growth
 We will continue to pursue market share gains by providing high complexity, cancer-related laboratory testing services to hospitals, community-based pathology practices, academic centers, clinicians, and Pharmaceutical companies in the United States and Europe.  We will strive to improve our services and achieve long term profitable growth by developing cross functional teams to analyze the unique requirements of key market segments.  We will engage our customers within these segments and analyze our strengths, weaknesses and threats to find ways to further drive growth and pursue excellent service. We will continue to seek customer feedback through our rigorous survey process, assess our customer’s satisfaction with our services, and develop plans for improvement. 
 While our client retention rate is excellent, in 2018 we will focus on continuing to provide consistently high service levels while engaging our customers.  In addition, we will work to maintain our broad and innovative test menu of molecular, immunohistochemistry, and other testing, which has helped make us a “one stop shop” for many clients who value that all of their testing can be sent to one laboratory.  
 Our plans for 2018 include reimbursement and legislative strategies to drive profitable growth.  We are closely monitoring changes in legislation, are taking specific actions and establishing detailed plans to be prepared for possible changes in legislation.  
 We expect that our expansion into Europe will fuel profitable growth in our Pharma Services business in the long-term.  In addition, we are currently expanding our laboratory facility in Houston, Texas due to increased demand for Pharma Services.  
 We will continue to look for growth opportunities through mergers and/or acquisitions and are focused on strategic opportunities that would be complementary to our menu of services and would increase our earnings and cash flow in the short to medium timeframe. 
 Competitive Strengths
 Turnaround Times
 In our Clinical Services segment, we strive to provide industry leading turnaround times for test results to our clients nationwide.  By providing information to our clients in a rapid manner, physicians can begin treating their patients as soon as possible.  We believe our historical average 4-5 day turnaround time for our cytogenetics testing services, 3-4 day turnaround time for FISH testing services, 7 day turnaround time for molecular testing, and 1 day turnaround time for flow cytometry and pathology testing services are industry leading benchmarks for national laboratories.  
 Our consistent timeliness of results is a competitive strength and a driver of additional testing requests by our referring physicians.  Rapid turnaround times allow for the performance of other adjunctive tests within an acceptable diagnosis window in order to augment or confirm results and more fully inform treatment options.  We believe that fast turnaround times are a key differentiator versus other national laboratories, and our clients often cite them as a key factor in their relationship with us.  
 Fast response time is also critical to customer satisfaction in our Pharma Services segment.  We work with the sponsors to set up the studies quickly and to provide rapid turnaround on the testing results once the samples from the study enrollees arrive at the laboratory.  Final transmissions of data are also critical to sponsors who are often working on their own submissions to the FDA for approval of drug compounds.  We believe that our rapid turnaround time on testing and our project milestones are a key differentiator in the Pharma Services segment.

World-class Medical and Scientific Team
 Our team of medical professionals and Ph.Ds. are specialists in the field of genetics, oncology and pathology.  As of December 31, 2017, we employed, or contracted with approximately 30 full-time M.D.s and Ph.Ds.  We have many nationally world renowned pathologists on staff, which is a key differentiator from many smaller laboratories.  Our clinical customers look to our staff and their expertise and they often call our medical team on challenging cases.  For our Pharma Services segment, many sponsors work with our medical team on their study design and on the interpretation of results from the studies.  Again, our medical team is a key differentiator as we have a depth of medical expertise that many other laboratories cannot offer to Pharmaceutical companies.
Extensive Tech-Only Service Offerings
 We believe that NeoGenomics currently has the most extensive menu of tech-only FISH services in the country as well as extensive and advanced tech-only flow cytometry and IHC testing services.  These types of testing services allow the professional interpretation component of a test to be performed and billed separately by our physician clients.  Our FISH, flow cytometry and other tech-only service offerings allow properly trained and credentialed community-based pathologists to extend their own practices by performing professional interpretations services, which allows them to better service the needs of their local clientele without the need to invest in the lab equipment and personnel required to perform the technical component of genetic and molecular testing.
 Our tech-only services are designed to give pathologists the option to choose, on a case by case basis, whether they want to order just the technical information and images relating to a specific test so they can perform the professional interpretation, or order global services and receive a comprehensive test report which includes a NeoGenomics pathologist’s interpretation of the test results.  Our clients appreciate the flexibility to access NeoGenomics’ medical staff for difficult or complex cases or when they are otherwise unavailable to perform professional interpretations.  We believe this innovative approach to serving the needs of pathology clients’ results in longer term, more committed client relationships that are, in effect, strategic partnerships. Our extensive tech-only service offerings have differentiated us and allowed us to compete more effectively.  
 Global Service Offerings
 We offer a comprehensive suite of technical and interpretation services to meet the needs of those clients who are not credentialed and trained in interpreting genetic tests and who require pathology specialists to interpret the testing results for them. In our global service offerings, our lab performs the technical component of the tests and our M.D.s and Ph.Ds. provide the service of interpreting the results of those tests. Our professional staff is also available for post-test consultative services. Clients using our global service offering rely on the expertise of our medical team to give them the answers they need in a timely manner to help inform their diagnoses and treatment decisions. Many of our tech-only clients also rely on our medical team for difficult or challenging cases by ordering our global testing services on a case-by-case basis.  Our medical team can serve as a backup to support our clients who need help to satisfy the continued and demanding requirements of their practice. Our reporting capabilities allow for all relevant case data from our global services to be captured in one summary report. When providing global services, NeoGenomics bills for both the technical and professional component of the test, which results in a higher reimbursement level.
Client Education Programs
 We believe we have one of the most extensive client education programs in the genetic and molecular testing industry. We train pathologists how to use and interpret genetic testing services so that they can better interpret technical data and render their diagnosis. 
 Our educational programs include an extensive library of on-demand training modules, online courses, and custom tailored on-site training programs that are designed to prepare clients to utilize our tech-only services. We offer

NEOGENOMICS, INC.
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
 
training and information on new cancer tests and the latest developments in the field of molecular genetic testing. Each year, we also regularly sponsor seminars and webinars on emerging topics of interest in our field. Our medical staff is involved in many aspects of our training programs.
 Superior Testing Technologies and Instrumentation
 We use some of the most advanced testing technologies and instrumentation in the laboratory industry. The use of next generation sequencing in our molecular testing allows us to detect multiple mutations and our proprietary techniques allow us to achieve high sensitivity in our next generation sequencing testing.  In addition, we use high sensitivity Sanger sequencing, RNA and DNA quantification, SNP/Cytogenetic arrays, Fragment Length analysis, and other molecular testing technologies.  Our automated FISH and Cytogenetics tools allow us to deliver the highest quality testing to our clients and our flow cytometry laboratory uses 10-color flow cytometry analysis technology on a technical-only basis. NeoGenomics is continually testing new laboratory equipment in order to remain at the forefront of new developments in the testing field.
Laboratory Information System 
 We believe we have a state-of-the-art LIS that interconnects our locations and provides flexible reporting solutions to clients.  This system allows us to standardize testing and deliver uniform test results and images throughout our network, regardless of the location that any specific portion of a test is performed within our network.  This allows us to move specimens and image analysis work between locations to better balance our workload.  Our LIS also allows us to offer highly specialized and customizable reporting solutions to our tech-only clients.  For instance, our tech-only FISH and flow cytometry applications allow our community-based pathologist clients to tailor individual reports to their specifications and incorporate only the images they select and then issue and sign-out such reports using our system.  Our customized reporting solution also allows our clients to incorporate test results performed on ancillary tests not performed at NeoGenomics into summary report templates.  This FlexREPORT feature has been well-received by clients.
National Direct Sales Force and Marketing 
 Our direct sales force has been trained extensively in cancer genetic testing and consultative selling skills to service the needs of clients.  Our sales team for the clinical cancer testing services is organized into five regions (Northeast, Southeast, North Central, South Central and West), and we have a separate sales team for our Pharma Services division.  These sales representatives utilize our custom Customer Relationship Management System (“CRM”) to manage their territories, and we have integrated all of the important customer care functionality within our LIS into the CRM so that our sales representatives can stay informed of emerging issues and opportunities within their regions.  Our in-house customer care team is aligned with our field sales team to serve the needs of our clients by utilizing the same LIS and CRM.  Our field teams can see in real-time when a client calls the laboratory, the reason for the call, the resolution, and if face-to-face interaction is needed for follow-up.
 We continue to produce higher testing volumes and revenue due to our ongoing investment in sales and marketing.  We have expanded the size of our sales team and are investing more in trade shows and in our overall marketing budget.  We plan to continue to develop and execute strategic marketing plans throughout 2018. 
 Geographic Locations
 Many high complexity laboratories within the cancer testing industry have operated a core facility on either the West Coast or the East Coast of the United States to service the needs of their customers around the country. We believe our clients and prospects desire to do business with a laboratory with national breadth and a local presence, and have developed our laboratory facility strategy accordingly.  We have seven facilities, including three large laboratory locations in Fort Myers, Florida, Aliso Viejo, California, and Houston Texas.  We also have four smaller laboratory locations in Fresno, California, Nashville, Tennessee, Tampa, Florida and Rolle, Switzerland. Our objective is to “operate one lab with multiple locations” in order to deliver standardized, high quality, test results. In November 2017, we opened a laboratory in Rolle, Switzerland where we are offering Pharma Services to international clients.  In addition, due to growth in the Pharma Services segment, we are constructing a new, expanded laboratory in 
 10

NEOGENOMICS, INC.
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
 
Houston, Texas, which is a Pharma-first facility. In 2018, we are also opening a small laboratory facility in Atlanta, Georgia to offer rapid turnaround time testing to clients in that market.  We intend to continue our growth and open new laboratories and/or expand our current facilities as market situations dictate and business opportunities arise.
 Seasonality
 The majority of our clinical testing volume is dependent on patients being treated by hematology/oncology professionals and other healthcare providers. The volume of our testing services generally declines modestly during the summer vacation season, year-end holiday periods and other major holidays, particularly when those holidays fall during the middle of the week. In addition, the volume of our testing tends to decline due to extreme adverse weather conditions, such as excessively hot or cold spells, heavy snow, hurricanes or tornados in certain regions, consequently reducing revenues and cash flows in any affected period. Therefore, comparison of the results of successive periods may not accurately reflect trends for future periods.
 In our Pharma Services business, we enter into both short term and long term contracts, ranging from one month to several years.  While the volume of this testing is not as directly affected by seasonality as described above, the testing volume does vary based on the terms of the contract.  Many of our long term contracts contain specific performance obligations whereas the testing is performed on a specific schedule.  This results in revenue that is not consistent among periods.  In addition, this results in backlog that can be significant.  
 In the third quarter of 2017, our Houston, Texas laboratory was impacted by Hurricane Harvey and the resulting wide spread flooding in the area.  While our facility was not damaged, many of our customers were unable to open for several days which impacted our business.  A few weeks later our Fort Myers, Florida laboratory was impacted by Hurricane Irma.  Our laboratory was not damaged and while power did go out in the area our generator kept power to our lab.  Extensive power outages in the southern half of Florida did impact many of our customers who were unable to open for days after the storm had passed.  The storms had a significant impact on our third quarter revenue.  
 Competition 
 For our Clinical Services segment, the genetic and molecular testing niche of the laboratory testing industry is highly competitive and, given the opportunities in this industry, we expect it to become even more competitive. Competitive factors in genetic and molecular testing generally include the reputation of the laboratory, range of services offered, pricing, convenience of sample collection and pick-up, quality of analysis and reporting, medical staff, timeliness of delivery of completed reports (i.e. turnaround times) and post-reporting follow-up for clients.
 Our competitors for our Clinical Services segment in the United States are numerous and include major national medical testing laboratories, hospital laboratories and in-house physician laboratories. Our principal competitors are Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America.  Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and production capabilities than us. These companies may succeed in developing service offerings that are more effective than any that we have or may develop, and may also prove to be more successful than we are in marketing such services. In addition, technological advances or different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors may render our service offerings obsolete, less effective or uneconomical.  
 We intend to continue our efforts to gain market share by offering industry-leading turnaround times, a broad service menu, high-quality test reports, new tests including proprietary ones, enhanced post-test consultation services, and the personal attention from our direct sales force. In addition, we believe our flexible reporting solutions, which enable clients to report out customized results in a secure, real-time environment, will allow us to continue to gain market share.
 Our Pharma Services business competes against many other clinical research organizations and central reference laboratories.  Many of these competitors are much larger and have a greater international presence than we do.  Over the past year, we expanded our Pharma Services business into Europe at the request of our clients and believe that our state of the art testing menu and our high level of service along with our international expansion will allow us to continue to gain market share in this segment.   
 11

NEOGENOMICS, INC.
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
 
Our Pharma Services segment competitors are numerous Contract Resource Organizations or “CRO’s”. These include larger multi-national firms such as IQVIA, Covance, Parexcel and ICON.  These competitors are larger than NeoGenomics and have global operations including operations in Asia, where we do not yet have service capabilities.  These laboratories may be more effective than us in gaining business for global clinical trials.  Many clinical reference laboratories have also entered the space in support of clinical trials and the related laboratory testing.  These reference laboratories can often compete with lower pricing for smaller more limited studies.  We believe our service focus and our leading Molecular and Immunohistochemistry platforms, as well as our exclusive MultiOmyx platform will continue to lead to rapid growth in this segment.
 Suppliers
 The Company orders its laboratory and research supplies from large national laboratory supply companies. We do not believe a short term disruption from any one of these suppliers would have a material effect on our business.
Dependence on Major Clients 
 We market our services to pathologists, oncologists, urologists, other clinicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical firms and other clinical laboratories throughout the United States and Europe. The Company’s client base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed clients diversified across various customer types. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, no single client accounted for more than 5% of revenue.  
Payer Mix
 The following table reflects our estimate of the breakdown of net clinical revenue by type of payer for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:
 
 
 | 2017 | | | 2016 | | 2015
-------------------------------------+------+-----+---+------+-----+-----
Medicare and other government | | 15 | % | | 16 | % | 21 | %
Commercial insurance | | 18 | % | | 25 | % | 21 | %
Client direct billing | | 64 | % | | 56 | % | 55 | %
Patient, other and year-end accruals | | 3 | % | | 3 | % | 3 | %
Total | | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

 
Our proportion of client direct billing has increased over the years shown above, as more payers, including Medicare, private commercial insurances and Medicare Advantage plans, are practicing “consolidated payment” or “bundled payment” models where they pay the hospitals a lump sum, which is intended to include laboratory testing.  This reflects an increase in the amount of risk sharing that CMS and other private payers are encouraging providers such as hospital systems to undertake.  We anticipate a gradual increase in the percentage of client direct billing in the coming years. 
 Trademarks 
 The “NeoGenomics” and “Clarient” names and logos have been trademarked with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have also trademarked or have applications pending for the brand names NeoFISH, NeoFLOW, NeoSITE, NeoArray, NeoTYPE, NeoSCORE, NeoLAB and NeoLINK. We have also trademarked the marketing slogans, “When time matters and results count” and “Time matters, results count.”
Insurance
 We maintain professional liability and numerous other insurance policies. We believe that our present insurance is sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures, but we cannot assure that we will not incur liabilities in excess of the policy coverage limits. In addition, although we believe that we will be able to continue to obtain adequate insurance coverage, we cannot assure that we will be able to do so at acceptable cost.

 Number of Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1,000 full-time equivalent employees and contracted pathologists. The Company also had approximately 30 temporary contract personnel at December 31, 2017. Our employees are not represented by any union and we believe our employee relations are good.
Government Regulation
 The laboratory business is subject to extensive governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Our laboratories are required to be licensed by the states, certified by the federal government to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and are subject to extensive requirements as a condition of participation in various governmental health benefits programs. The failure to comply with any of the applicable federal and state laws, regulations, and reimbursement guidelines could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The applicable laws and regulations, and the interpretations of them, change frequently and there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to audit, inquiry, or investigation with respect to some aspect of its operations. Some of the federal and state laws and regulations are described below under “Clinical Laboratory Operations,” “Anti-Fraud and Abuse Laws,” “The False Claims Act,” “Confidentiality of Health Information” and “Food and Drug Administration”.
Clinical Laboratory Operations
 Licensure and Accreditation
The Company operates clinical laboratories in Florida, Tennessee, Texas and California. The laboratories are licensed as required by the states in which they are located. In addition, the laboratories in Fort Myers, Florida, Aliso Viejo, California, and Nashville, Tennessee are licensed by the State of New York as they accept clinical specimens obtained in New York.  All of our laboratories are certified in accordance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, as amended (“CLIA”). Under CLIA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) establishes quality standards for each category of testing performed by the laboratory. The categories of testing include waived, moderate complexity and high complexity. NeoGenomics’ laboratories are categorized as high complexity.  Four of the seven site locations for NeoGenomics’ laboratories are also accredited by the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) and actively participate in CAP’s proficiency testing programs for all tests offered by the Company. Our Tampa, Florida and Fresno, California facilities are read-only laboratories and, therefore, wouldn’t qualify for CAP accreditation.  Our Houston, Texas location mainly supports Pharma Services and was recently approved for its CAP accreditation. Proficiency testing programs require the participating laboratories to test specimens that they receive from the testing entity and return the results. The testing entity, conducting an approved program, analyzes the results returned and provides to the Company a quality control report assessing the results. An important component of a quality assurance program is to establish whether the laboratory’s test results are accurate and valid.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
 
The federal and state certification and licensure programs establish standards for the operation of clinical laboratories, including, but not limited to, qualifications of personnel and quality control. Compliance with such standards is verified by periodic inspections by inspectors employed by federal and state regulatory agencies and accrediting organizations. The Company has a Quality Assurance Committee, which is comprised of representatives of all departments of the Company, conducts routine internal surveys and requires corrective action reports in response to the findings.
 Quality of Care
 Our mission is to improve patient care through quality cancer genetic diagnostic services. By delivering exceptional service and innovative solutions, we aspire to become the world’s leading cancer and information company. The quality of care provided to clients and their patients is of paramount importance to us. We maintain quality control processes, including standard operating procedures, controls, performance measurement and reporting mechanisms. Our employees are committed to providing accurate, reliable and consistent services at all times. Any concerns regarding the quality of testing or services provided by the Company are immediately communicated to our Medical Team, Company management and, if necessary, the Director for Quality Systems, the Compliance Department or Human Resources Department.  We also continually revise and improve our tests and work with laboratory equipment vendors to ensure that our laboratory has the highest possible quality.
Compliance Program
 The health care industry is highly regulated and scrutinized with respect to fraud, abusive billing practices and improper financial relationships between health care companies and their referral sources. The Office of the Inspector General of HHS (the “OIG”) has published compliance guidance, including the Compliance Program Guidance for Clinical Laboratories in August of 1998, and advisory opinions. The Company has implemented a robust Compliance Program, which is overseen by our Board of Directors. Its objective is to ensure compliance with the myriad federal and state laws, regulations and governmental guidance applicable to our business. Our program consists of training/education of employees and monitoring and auditing Company practices. The Board of Directors has formed a Compliance Committee of the Board, which meets regularly to discuss all compliance-related issues that may affect the Company. The Company reviews its policies and procedures as new regulations and interpretations come to light to comply with applicable regulations. The Chief Compliance Officer reports directly to the Compliance Committee.
Hotline
 As part of its Compliance Program, the Company provides a hotline for employees who wish to anonymously or confidentially report suspected violations of our codes of conduct, policies/procedures, or laws and regulations. Employees are strongly encouraged to report any suspected violation if they do not feel the problem can be appropriately addressed through the normal chain of command. The hotline does not replace other resources available to our employees, including supervisors, managers and human resources staff, but is an alternative channel available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The hotline forwards all reports to the Compliance Officer who is responsible for investigating, reporting to the Compliance Committee, and documenting the disposition of each report. The hotline forwards any calls pertaining to the financial statements or financial issues to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Company does not allow any retaliation against an employee who reports a compliance related issue  in good faith.
Laboratory Developed Tests (“LDTs”):
 The federal Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, test kits reagents and other medical devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing. High complexity and CLIA-certified laboratories, such as ours, frequently develop internal testing procedures to provide diagnostic results to customers. These tests are referred to as laboratory developed tests (“LDTs”). LDTs are subject to CMS oversight through its enforcement of CLIA. The FDA has also claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs, but indicates that it has exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs offered by high 
 14

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
 
complexity CLIA-certified laboratories, and has not subjected these tests to FDA rules and regulations governing medical devices. However, the FDA has stated that it has been considering changes in the way it believes that laboratories ought to be allowed to offer these LDTs, and since 2010 publicly announced that it would be exercising regulatory authority over LDTs, using a risk-based approach that will direct more resources to tests with the highest risk of injury. In October 2014, the FDA published a draft guidance setting forth its proposed framework and timetable for regulating LTDs. The FDA received numerous comments both in support of and opposed to the draft guidance.  In November 2016, FDA announced that it would not be finalizing the draft guidance.  On January 13, 2017, FDA published a non-binding Discussion Paper to “advance the public discussion by providing a possible approach to spur further dialogue.”  The Discussion Paper sets forth a possible LDT regulatory approach where LDTs currently on the market would be exempt from FDA regulation except for adverse event and malfunction reporting, and regulation of new and modified LDTs would be phased in over four years, based on risk.  It remains uncertain whether FDA’s proposed approach will be adopted by the FDA or Congress.  It is also uncertain what position the new administration will adopt with respect to LDTs. It is possible that the FDA could adopt a new policy, or Congress could enact new legislation, that may result in increased regulatory burdens for us to register and continue to offer our tests or to develop and introduce new tests, or modify existing tests and may increase our costs.  We cannot be certain as to which of our tests would require FDA review and approval, and if approval was to be required, that our tests could obtain FDA approval.
 The federal laws governing Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health benefits, as well as other state and federal laws, regulate certain aspects of the relationships between health care providers, including clinical laboratories, and their referral sources, including physicians, hospitals, other laboratories and other entities. We are subject to 
the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“federal AKS”), as well as similar state statutes and regulations, which prohibit the 
offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for 
or recommending the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items or services payable 
by Medicare, Medicaid or 
any other federally funded healthcare program. The federal AKS defines remuneration to include anything of value, in cash or in kind, and thus can implicate financial relationships including payments not commensurate with fair market value, such as in the form of space, equipment leases, professional or technical services or anything else of value. 
 The federal AKS is an “intent‑based” statute, meaning that a violation occurs when one or both parties intend the remuneration to be in exchange for or to induce referrals. Violations of the federal AKS may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $25,000, imprisonment of up to five years, civil penalties under the federal CMP Law of up to $50,000 for each violation, plus three times the remuneration involved, civil penalties under the federal False Claims Act of up to $11,000 for each claim submitted, plus three times the amounts paid for such claims and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 Because of the broad proscriptions of the federal AKS, subsequent federal law required the HHS to publish regulations to guide the health care community in structuring relationships that would not violate the law. The OIG published regulations outlining certain categories of relationships between health care providers and persons or entities that may have a referral relationship that would be deemed not to violate the federal AKS. These regulations are known as the Safe Harbor Regulations (the “Safe Harbor Regulations”) because persons who enter into transactions that comply with all of the criteria for an applicable safe harbor will not violate 
the AKS. The Safe Harbor Regulations are narrowly drafted to avoid inadvertently immunizing prohibited conduct. A relationship or transaction that does not meet all of the criteria of an applicable Safe Harbor Regulation is not deemed to be illegal per se, rather it may be subject to additional scrutiny. The Company endeavors to comply with the Safe Harbor Regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company would not be subject to investigation and, if investigated, that relationships could be found not to comply with the Safe Harbor Regulations.
 Further, most states have adopted similar anti-kickback laws prohibiting the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of remuneration in exchange for referrals, and typically impose criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licenses. Some of these state laws apply to items and services paid for by private payers as well as to government payers. In addition, many states have adopted laws prohibiting the splitting or sharing of fees between physicians and non‑physicians, as well as between treating physicians and referral sources. We believe our arrangements with physicians comply with the federal AKS, and state anti-kickback and fee‑splitting laws of the states in which we operate, however, if government regulatory authorities were to disagree, we could be subject to civil and criminal 
 15

NEOGENOMICS, INC.
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
 
penalties, and be required to restructure or terminate our contractual and other arrangements with physicians. This could result in a loss of revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Medicare Payment Guidelines
 We have various billing arrangements with our clients and with third party payers, including the Medicare program. When 
the Company bills the client for all, or a portion of, a lab test performed, these client billing arrangements are priced competitively at fair market value. These client billing arrangements may implicate the prohibition of the Medicare program against charging the Medicare or Medicaid programs fees substantially in excess of the Company’s usual and customary charges. These billing arrangements may also implicate the federal Stark Law and the federal and state anti-kickback statutes.
 Federal law authorizes the Secretary of HHS to suspend or exclude providers from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs if providers 
charge Medicare or state Medicaid programs fees “substantially in excess” of their “usual charges.” The OIG has stated in commentary to various final and proposed regulations its position that this statute has limited applicability to the current Medicare reimbursement system, though the OIG has also commented 
“we note that ancillary services, such as laboratory tests and drugs, would remain subject to these regulations, even when furnished by physicians.
” [F.R., Vol. 68, No. 178, September 15, 2003 at 53940]. As such, application of this prohibition to the Company’s business is not clear, but the government could scrutinize the Company’s pricing and billing arrangements and determine to apply this law. 
 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services promulgated, in 2009, a revision to the regulation that prohibits the mark up of purchased diagnostic services [42 C.F.R. §414.50] (the “Anti-Markup Rule”). The Anti-Markup Rule prohibits a physician or other supplier from marking up the price paid for the technical or professional component of a diagnostic test that was ordered by the billing physician or supplier and which was performed by a physician who does not share a practice with the billing physician or supplier. The billing physician is prohibited from billing the Medicare program an amount greater than the lesser of: (i) the performing supplier’s net charge to the billing physician; (ii) the billing physician’s actual charge; or (iii) the fee schedule amount for the test that would be allowed if the performing supplier billed directly.
 In light of the various federal regulations and guidance from the OIG, the Company seeks to price its products competitively while endeavoring to meet applicable statutes and regulations.
 Physician Self-Referral Laws
 The federal law referred to as the “Stark Law”, named after U.S. Representative Fortney “Pete” Stark, prohibits physicians who have a financial relationship with an entity from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to that entity for the provision of designated health services unless the transaction meets an exception to the law. A “financial relationship” includes both an ownership interest and/or a compensation arrangement with a physician, both direct and indirect, and DHS includes, but is not limited to, 
laboratory services. 
 The Stark Law prohibits an entity that receives a prohibited DHS referral from seeking payment from Medicare and Medicaid for any DHS services performed as a result of such a referral, unless an arrangement is carefully structure to satisfy every requirement of a regulatory exception. 
The Stark Law is a 
strict liability statute, and thus any technical violation requires repayment of all “tainted” referrals, regardless of the intent. Penalties for violating the Stark Law may include the denial of payment to an entity for the impermissible provision of DHS, the requirement to refund any amounts collected in violation of the Stark Law
, and civil monetary penalties of up to 
$15,000 for each violation and $100,000 for each circumvention arrangement or scheme. Other implications of a Stark Law violation may include criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs, and potential False Claims Act liability, including via “qui tam” action.
 The Company endeavors to structure its financial relationships in compliance with the Stark Law and with similar state physician self-referral laws.
 Further, many states have promulgated self
‑referral laws and regulations similar to the federal Stark Law, but these vary significantly based on the state. 
For example, the Florida Patient Self-Referral Act of 1992, as amended, (the “Florida Self-Referral 
Act”) is similar to the Stark law, but is narrower in some respects and broader in others. In 
 16

NEOGENOMICS, INC.
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
 
addition to services reimbursed by Medicaid or government payers, often these state laws and regulations can encompass services reimbursed by private payers as well. Penalties for violating state self-referral laws and regulations vary based on the state, but often include civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicaid, and loss of licenses. Our financial arrangements with physicians are governed by the federal Stark Law and similar state self-referral laws, and we rely on certain exceptions to the Stark Law with respect to such relationships. While we believe that our financial relationships with physicians and referral practices are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that government authorities would agree. If we are found by the government to be in violation of the Stark Law or a similar state self-referral law, we could be subject to significant penalties, including fines as specified above, exclusion from participation in government and private payer programs and requirements to refund amounts previously received from government.
 The False Claims Act
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the U.S. government, or to a Medicare program contractor, a false or fraudulent claim for payment, or knowingly making or using a false record or statement to have a false claim paid by the government, or conspiring to defraud the U.S. government, or knowingly making or using a false statement to conceal an obligation to pay the government, or improperly retaining overpayments from, the government. A violation of the federal False Claims Act is punishable by a civil penalty of $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim 
plus three times the amount of damages 
sustained by the government. Further, False Claims Act liability may lead to 
exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. The False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions are being used with more frequency to challenge the reimbursement practices of providers and suppliers. Those provisions allow a private individual to 
bring an action on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has submitted false claims for payment to the federal government. The government must decide whether to intervene in the lawsuit and whether to prosecute the case. If it declines to do so, the individual may pursue the case alone, although the government must be kept apprised of the progress of the lawsuit. Whether or not the federal government intervenes in the case, it will receive the majority of any recovery. The successful qui tam relator who brought the case 
is entitled to a portion 
of the proceeds and its attorneys’ fees and costs
. As most qui tam cases are filed by current or former employees, an effective compliance program plays a crucial role in reducing the Company’s exposure to liability. It is also a criminal offense, under Title 18 U.S. Code, Section 287, for a person or entity to make a claim against the United States or any department or agency, knowing the claim to be false, fictitious or fraudulent. The penalty is a fine, and imprisonment of up to five years. The federal False Claims Act has been an effective enforcement tool for the federal government. Many states have enacted similar false claims acts as well.
 The Company seeks to structure its arrangements with physicians and other clients to be in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law, state laws, and the federal False Claims Act and to stay abreast of current developments and changes in the law and regulations. However, these laws and regulations are complex and subject to interpretation. Consequently, we are unable to ascertain with certainty that any of our transactions will not be subject to scrutiny and, if scrutinized, will not result in sanctions or penalties. The Company has taken, 
and will continue to take, actions to endeavor to ensure compliance with the myriad federal and state laws that govern our business.
 Confidentiality and Security of Personal Health Information 
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”), 
contains provisions that protect individually identifiable health information from unauthorized use or disclosure by covered entities and their business associates. The Office for Civil Rights of HHS, the agency responsible for enforcing HIPAA, has published regulations to address the privacy (the “Privacy Rule”) and security (the “Security Rule”) of protected health information (“PHI”). The Company is a covered entity under HIPAA and has adopted policies and procedures to comply with the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule and HIPAA statute. The 
health care facilities and providers that refer specimens to the Company are also bound by HIPAA.  HIPAA also requires that all providers who transmit claims for health care goods or services electronically utilize standard transaction and data sets and to standardize national provider identification codes. The Company has taken necessary steps to comply with HIPAA regulations, 
 17

NEOGENOMICS, INC.
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
 
utilizes standard transaction data sets, and has obtained and implemented national provider identifiers, or NPIs, as the standard unique health identifier in filing and processing health care claims and other transactions.
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (“ARRA”) recently enacted the HITECH Act which extends the scope of HIPAA to permit enforcement against business associates for a violation, establishes new requirements to notify the Office for Civil Rights of HHS of a breach of HIPAA, and allows the Attorneys General of the states to bring actions to enforce violations of HIPAA. Rules implementing various aspects of HIPAA are continuing to be promulgated
. With respect to these rules, commencing July 1, 2012, CMS required all HIPAA-covered entities such as the Company to conduct electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions under a new HIPAA transaction standard called Version 5010. 
 In addition to the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule described above, the Company is subject to state laws regarding the handling and disclosure of patient records and patient health information. These laws vary widely. Penalties for violation include sanctions against a laboratory’s licensure as well as civil or criminal penalties. Additionally, private individuals may have a right of action against the Company for a violation of a state’s privacy laws. We believe we are in material compliance with current state laws regarding the confidentiality of health information and will continue to monitor and comply with new or changing state laws.
 The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, enacted on Dec. 4, 2003, directed the Federal Trade Commission to implement regulations to protect consumers against identity theft. The Federal Trade Commission issued what are referred to as the “Red Flag Rules”, but the effective date for enforcement has been delayed several times. The Red Flag Rules are now subject to enforcement as of January 1, 2012. The Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010 (“RFPCA”) gave some relief to health care providers by changing the definition of “creditor”, thereby narrowing the application to health care providers who do not otherwise obtain or use consumer reports or furnish information to consumer reporting agencies in connection with a credit transaction. Health care providers who act as a “creditor” to any of its patients with respect to a “covered account” are required to implement an identity theft protection program to safeguard patient information. A creditor includes any entity that regularly in the course of business obtains or uses consumer reports in connection with credit transactions, furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency in connection with a credit transaction, or advances funds to or on behalf of a person based on the person’s obligation to repay the funds or repayable from specific property pledged by or on behalf of the person. But, a creditor, as defined in the RFPCA, that advances funds on behalf of a person for expenses incidental to a services provided by the creditor to that person is not subject to the Red Flag Rules. The Company has developed a written program designed to identify and detect the relevant warning signs – or “red flags” – of identity theft and establish appropriate responses to prevent and mitigate identity theft in order to comply with the Red Flag Rules. We are also developing a plan to update the program, and the program will be managed by senior management staff under the policy direction of our Board of Directors. The Company intends to take such steps as necessary to determine the extent to which the Red Flag Rules apply to it and to take such steps as necessary to comply.
