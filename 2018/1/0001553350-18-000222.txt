Our Company
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on June 24, 1997 and in 2004 we acquired PSI-TEC Corp., and in 2006 we merged with PSI-TEC Corp. PSI-TEC Corp. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 12, 1995. In 2008 we changed our name to Lightwave Logic, Inc. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the Company, we, our or us and other similar terms means Lightwave Logic, Inc., a Nevada corporation.

Our principal executive office is located at 369 Inverness Parkway, Suite 350, Englewood, CO 80112, and our telephone number is (720) 340-4949. Our website address is www.lightwavelogic.com. No information found on our website is part of this report. Also, this report includes the names of various government agencies and the trade names of other companies.

Overview

Lightwave Logic, Inc. is a development stage company whose P2ICTM technology addresses advanced telecommunication, data communications, and data center markets utilizing its advanced organic electro-optic polymer systems. The Company currently has two business segments to support its development activities, its materials development segment, and its photonic device design and development segment. 
Materials Development

The Company designs and synthesizes organic chromophores for use in its own proprietary electro-optic polymer systems and photonic device designs. A polymer system is not solely a material, but also encompasses various technical enhancements necessary for its implementation. These include host polymers, poling methodologies, and molecular spacer systems that are customized to achieve specific optical properties. Our organic electro-optic polymer systems compounds are mixed into solution form that allows for thin film application. Our proprietary electro-optic polymers are designed at the molecular level for potentially superior performance, stability and cost-efficiency. We believe they have the potential to replace more expensive, lower-performance materials and devices used in fiber-optic ground, wireless and satellite communication networks.

Our patented and patent pending molecular architectures are based on a well-understood chemical and quantum mechanical occurrence known as aromaticity. Aromaticity provides a high degree of molecular stability that enables our core molecular structures to maintain stability under a broad range of polymerization conditions that otherwise appear to affect other current polymer molecular designs. 

We expect our patented and patent-pending optical materials along with trade secrets and licensed materials, to be the core of and the enabling technology for future generations of optical devices, modules, sub-systems and systems that we will develop or potentially out-license to electro-optic device manufacturers. The Company contemplates future applications that may address the needs of semiconductor companies, aerospace companies and government agencies.

Prototype Device Design and Development

Electro-optic Modulators

The Company designs its own proprietary electro-optical modulation devices. Electro-optical modulators convert data from electric signals (binary data) into optical signals that can then be transmitted over high-speed fiber-optic cables. These devices are key components that have historically limited the ability of telecommunications, data communications, data centers networks to keep up with the seemingly endless flow of data in the form of voice calls, text messages, pictures, video streaming that are being transmitted to a growing array of devices.

Polymer Photonic Integrated Circuits (P2ICTM)

The Company also designs its own proprietary Polymer Photonic Integrated Circuits. A Polymer Photonic Integrated Circuit is a photonic device that integrates several photonic functions on a single chip. We believe that our technology can enable the ultra-miniaturization needed to increase the number of photonic functions residing on a semiconductor chip to create a progression like what was seen in the computer integrated circuits, commonly referred to as Moores Law. 

Current photonic technology is based on inorganic crystalline materials, which due to physical limitations have not been able to address devices such as slot waveguides that require highly miniaturized geometries. Slot modulators have the potential to scale in integration for increased functionality and would be highly beneficial to data center infrastructure. Organic electro-optic polymers have greater potential because they can be applied as a thin film coating. Our polymers are unique in that they can withstand extremely high semiconductor process temperatures to seamlessly integrate into existing CMOS, Indium Phosphide (InP), Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), and other semiconductor manufacturing lines. Our devices, enabled by our organic electro-optic polymer material systems, work by affecting the optical properties of light in the presence of an electric field at extremely high frequencies (wide bandwidths) and possess inherent advantages over current crystalline electro-optic material contained in most modulator devices such as lithium niobate, indium phosphide and gallium arsenide.

Glossary

Glossary of select technology terms to provide you with a better understanding our Companys technology and devices:

Electro-optic devices - Electro-optic devices convert data from electric signals into optical signals for use in communications systems and in optical interconnects for high-speed data transfer.

Electro-optic material - Electro-optic material is the core active ingredient in high-speed fiber-optic telecommunication systems. Electro-optic materials are materials that are engineered at the molecular level. Molecular level engineering is commonly referred to as nanotechnology.

Electro-optic modulators - Electro-optic (E/O) modulators are electro-optic devices that perform electric-to-optic conversions within the infrastructure of the Internet. Data centers may also benefit from this technology through devices that could significantly increase bandwidth and speed while decreasing costs. Polymer E/O modulators can be designed and fabricated with multiple structures such as Ridge waveguide and slot waveguide. The waveguides allow the light to be efficiently coupled into and out of the modulators, and provide a basis for integrating modulators together.

Photonic Devices - Photonic devices are components for creating, manipulating or detecting light. This can include modulators, laser diodes, light-emitting diodes, solar and photovoltaic cells, displays and optical amplifiers. Other examples are devices for modulating a beam of light and for combining and separating beams of light of different wavelength.

Polymers - Polymers, also known as plastics, are large carbon-based molecules that bond many small molecules together to form a long chain. Polymer materials can be engineered and optimized using nanotechnology to create a system in which unique surface, electrical, chemical and electro-optic characteristics can be controlled. Materials based on polymers are used in a multitude of industrial and consumer products, from automotive parts to home appliances and furniture, as well as scientific and medical equipment.
Our Business Opportunity

Lightwave Logic, Inc. is developing next generation proprietary photonic devices that are based on our advanced electro-optical polymer material systems. Current legacy technology is based on inorganic crystalline materials, which has allowed for the proliferation of data over fiber optic cables. However, there are inherent molecular deficiencies that have prevented this technology from scaling down in price and up in functionality, especially in terms of $/Gbps. This is primarily due to a closed valence structure that does not allow for the molecular improvements. The valence or valency of an element is a measure of its combining power with other atoms when it forms chemical compounds or molecules. Also, the physical properties of a crystal do not allow for its implementation into highly miniaturize slot structures that are in simple terms the pathways that light travels through in the device.

Organic polymer materials on the other hand, have free electrons that allow for limitless potential to combine with other molecular structures, which allows for multiple options and combinations to improving performance characteristics. Importantly, because they can be applied to optical structures in thin-film liquid form, it is possible to imbue electro-optic ability to highly miniaturized slot structures. Organic polymer materials are also vastly cheaper to manufacture in comparison to growing exotic crystals that are prone to contamination and further must be sliced into thin wafers. Our Company believes that the combination of less expensive manufacturing cost, ease of application, and better scalability, together with a lower cost of ownership due to marked less heat dissipation (requiring less cooling), will create enormous demand for our products. 

Many companies early attempts at developing commercially reliable organic polymers were stymied due to the difficulty of creating organic molecules that could remain electro-optically active after being subjected to the high heat of semiconductor manufacturing temperatures (such as silicon CMOS, InP, GaAs etc.). These early attempts also encountered difficulty synthesizing materials that could withstand photochemical bleaching (loss of sensitivity to specific frequencies) and material degradation due to high operating temperatures.

Over the last several years, our Company has made various scientific breakthroughs that have allowed for the synthesis of proprietary organic polymer materials that can withstand extremely high process temperatures of 1750C. Additionally, these materials have demonstrated photochemical stability, even after being subjected to tensor light for over 4,000 hours and exhibited little electro optic degradation even after 2,500 hours of continuous exposure to temperatures at 1100C  exceeding typical commercial operating temperatures of approximately 850C, as found in data center applications. After successfully achieving material test results that either met or exceeded commercial requirements (subsequently confirmed by an outside entity), in late 2016, the Company began production of its first photonic prototype device, a ridge waveguide modulator.

Our First Product  The Ridge Waveguide Modulator 

A ridge waveguide modulator is a type of modulator where the waveguide is fabricated within a layer of our electro-optic polymer system. Various cladding materials and electrodes are layered over the core polymer. The polymer materials are then part of an integrated photonics platform that can house other photonic devices, such as lasers, waveguides etc. 

In April 2017 we achieved bandwidth suitable for 25Gbps data rates in an all-organic polymer ridge waveguide intensity modulator prototype, a significant improvement over our initial 10Gbps device modulator prototype that was announced in 2016. This breakthrough was significant because a 25Gbps data rate is important to the optical networking industry because this data rate is a major node to achieve 100 Gbps (using 4 channels of 25 Gbps). In July 2017 we advanced our high-speed modulation performance to satisfy 28Gbps data rates for QSFP28 standards and 100Gbps data center applications.

In September 2017 we achieved outstanding performance of our ridge waveguide Mach-Zehnder modulators ahead of schedule, with bandwidth performance levels that will enable 50Gbps modulation in fiber-optic communications. This important achievement will allow users to utilize arrays of 4 x 50Gbps polymer modulators using PAM-4 encoding to access 400Gbps data rate systems. Pulse-Amplitude Modulation (PAM-4) is an encoding scheme that can double the amount of data that can be transmitted.

We are now optimizing our high-performance modulators against typical specifications that are required by the fiber communications industry. Furthermore, we are packaging our modulators with our packaging partner so that potential customers can evaluate our high-performance modulators in their systems. One of the most under-evaluated processes of developing high speed devices onto a new and novel technology platform is robustness and reliability. We have already made extensive progress with our polymer materials on this front, and now we are integrating our robust polymer materials onto an integrated photonics platform to provide customers with a more miniaturized, higher performance solution for their data rich systems. 

We have also shown that with standard simulation and modeling of our devices, there is a potential to scale the high-speed performance beyond that of 50Gbps, thus providing a technology platform for even greater data rates in the future. This means that our technology platform using polymers is both scalable in high performance as well as scalable in miniaturization and low cost, something that the fiber communications industry has been searching for a long time.

While our initial focus is to address data communications and telecommunications network applications along with cloud computing/data center needs, we believe that in the future we will have additional opportunities to address other applications such as: backplane optical interconnects, photovoltaic cells, medical applications, satellite reconnaissance, navigation systems, radar applications, optical filters, spatial light modulators; and all-optical switches.

Electro-Optic Polymer Production  Our Approach vs. the BLA Approach

Our Electro-Optic Material Approach

Our core material expertise relates to the production of high-performance, high-stability electro-optic polymers for high-speed (wide bandwidth) telecommunication and datacommunications applications. More specifically, it lies in a less mainstream, yet firmly established, scientific phenomenon called aromaticity. Aromaticity causes a high degree of molecular stability. It is a molecular arrangement wherein atoms combine into multi-membered rings and share their electrons among each other. Aromatic compounds are stable because the electronic charge distributes evenly over a great area preventing hostile moieties, such as oxygen and free radicals, from finding an opening to attack. 
Previous and Current Competitive Organic Electro-Optic Polymer Efforts

For the past several decades, diverse corporate interests, including, to our knowledge, IBM, Lockheed Martin, DuPont, AT&T Bell Labs, Honeywell, Motorola, HP, 3M, and others in addition to numerous universities and U.S. Government Agencies, have attempted to produce high-performance, high-stability electro-optic polymers for high-speed (wide bandwidth) telecommunication applications. These efforts were largely unsuccessful due, in our opinion, to the industry's singular adherence to an industry pervasive engineering model known as the Bond Length Alternation ("BLA") theory model, which none of our patented molecular designs rely upon. The BLA model, like all other current industry-standard molecular designs, consists of molecular designs containing long strings of atoms called polyene chains. Longer polyene chains provide higher electro-optic performance, but are also more susceptible to environmental threats, which result in unacceptably low-performing, thermally unstable electro-optic polymers. 

As a result, high frequency modulators engineered with electro-optic polymers designed on the BLA model or any other polyene chain design models are unstable over typical operating temperature ranges, and often exhibit performance degradation within days, hours or even minutes. Similarly, lower frequency modulators exhibit comparable failings, but to a lesser extent. These flaws, in most cases, have prevented commercial quality polymer-based modulators from entering the commercial marketplace. The thermal stability of these devices does not generally meet the minimum Telcordia GR-468 operating temperature range (-40 degrees Celsius to +85 degrees Celsius) much less the harsher MILSPEC 883D (military specification) range of -55 degrees Celsius to 150 degrees Celsius. While many new applications do not require full military specifications for polymers, many potential customers prefer to see polymer operate at or near these conditions to convey confidence in the material system. We understand from initial conversations with data center architects and designers that the temperature specifications that our materials achieve are compliant with their equipment design needs. 

We are aware of other academic and commercial development effortssome by larger companies with vastly more financial resources than we possess. However, we believe that no one yet has developed organic polymer materials that have demonstrated the combination of thermal stability, photochemical stability that can meet or exceed commercial specifications.

Our Electro-Optic Photonic P2ICTM Device Approach

Our electro-optic devices are built around our proprietary organic polymer material systems that we believe will enable better performance than the current embedded legacy technology built around inorganic materials. We also believe that the inherent flexibility of being able to apply our organic polymer materials in liquid thin-film form will accelerate the move toward ultra-miniaturization of Polymer Photonic Integrated Circuits (P2ICTM) by increasing the number of photonic circuits on a single chip. Polymer photonics (previously referred in industry as silicon organic hybrid (SOH)) is the application of polymers on to a platform such as silicon where there are both active and passive photonic component designs. In polymer photonics, polymer devices such as modulators, waveguides, and multiplexers can be fabricated on to a silicon platform that acts as a package as well as a base for mounting lasers (which are needed to source the light).

Our initial device, a ridge waveguide modulator, though highly miniaturized utilizes conventional design and fabrication techniques in the industry. Our future devices will utilize silicon photonics (SiP) technology, which can support highly miniaturized slot waveguides structures etched in large format, low cost, and less expensive silicon wafers coated with our organic electro-optic polymers. The low-cost structure compares well to compound semiconductor technologies such as GaAs (Gallium arsenide) and InP (Indium Phosphide), which suffer from small format wafers that do not allow the economies of scale in high volume fabrication plants. The degree of miniaturization possible of the slot modulator using SiP is not technically feasible to accomplish with inorganic crystalline materials. Although this may not always remain the case, presently there are nearly insurmountable technical difficulties that are inherent to a crystalline molecule. 

Although we believe that our polymers will be the key differentiating factor in Polymer photonic devices, we do not currently possess the technical skills and instrumentation necessary to fabricate and test PICs at this dramatically reduced scale and intend to seek an external partner to assist with development. 

Our Intellectual Property

Our research and development efforts over the last 10 years have yielded our Company an extensive patent portfolio as well as critical trade secrets, unpatented technology and proprietary knowledge related to our optical polymer materials. Our intellectual property portfolio has expanded significantly over the last year as we are developing our P2IC into prototypes. We have filed more than 6 patents during 2017 and are currently in the process of readying a number of other inventions for formal filing later in 2018. We expect to continue innovating with our P2IC platform during 2018, and expect to at least maintain this level of invention at our Company during the whole of 2018. Our focus for 2018 is to establish the worlds first unique PerkinamineTM polymer based integrated photonics circuit portfolio of patents to support our working prototypes. 

We have filed 2 patents in 2018, and we expect another patent to be filed by early March 2018. In total, our patent portfolio consists of 13 granted patents that include 4 from the US, 1 from Canada, 5 from the EU, 2 from Japan and 1 from China. 

Our materials patent portfolio has also strengthened significantly in 2017 with the filing of additional new patent applications on our core PerkinamineTM molecular compounds as well as recent, innovative inventions that are expected to protect our P2IC polymer PIC platform from potential competition.

Included in our patent portfolio are the following nonlinear optic chromophore designs:


· | Stable Free Radical Chromophores, processes for preparing the same 
· | Stable Free Radical Chromophores, processes for preparing the same 
· | Tricyclic Spacer Systems for Nonlinear Optical Devices 
· | Anti-Aromatic Chromophore Architectures 
· | Heterocyclical Anti-Aromatic Chromophore Architectures 
· | Heterocyclical Chromophore Architectures 
· | Heterocyclical Chromophore Architectures with Novel Electronic Acceptor Systems


Our strategic plan is to utilize our core proprietary technology and leverage our proprietary optical materials to be the core of and the enabling technology for future generations of optical devices, modules, sub-systems and systems that we will develop or potentially out-license to electro-optic device manufacturers. Our Company contemplates future applications that may address the needs of semiconductor companies, aerospace companies and government agencies.

We rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and contractual provisions to protect our technologies. Further, employees are required to surrender any inventions or intellectual property developed as part of their employment agreements. We also have a policy of requiring prospective business partners to enter into non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) before disclosure of any of our confidential or proprietary information. Our Company can make no assurances that we will be able to effectively protect our technologies and know-how or that third parties will not be able to develop similar technologies and know-how independently.

The anti-aromatic nature of these structures dramatically improves the "zwitterionic-aromatic push-pull" of the systems, providing for low energy charge transfer. Low energy charge transfer is important for the production of extremely high electro-optic character.

Heterocyclical Steric Hindering System This patent describes a nitrogenous heterocyclical structure for the integration of steric hindering groups that are necessary for the nanoscale material integration. Due to the [pi]-orbital configuration of the nitrogen bridge, this structure has been demonstrated not to interfere with the conductive nature of the electronic conductive pathway and thus is non-disruptive to the electro-optic character of the core molecular construction. The quantum mechanical design of the system is designed to establish complete molecular planarity (flatness) for optimal performance.
Totally Integrated Material Engineering System This patent covers material integration structures under a design strategy known as Totally Integrated Material Engineering. These integration structures provide for the "wrapping" of the core molecule in sterically hindering groups that maximally protect the molecule from environmental threats and maximally protect it from microscopic aggregation (which is a major cause of performance degradation and optical loss) within a minimal molecular volume. These structures also provide for the integration of polymerizable groups for integration of materials into a highly stable cross-linked material matrix.
Our Recent Significant Events and Milestones Achieved

In November 2013, preliminary testing and initial data on our SOH/polymer photonic slot waveguide modulators demonstrated several promising characteristics. The tested SOH/polymer photonics chip had a 1-millimeter square footprint, enabling the possibility of sophisticated integrated optical circuits on a single silicon substrate. In addition, the waveguide structure was approximately 1/20 the length of a typical inorganic-based silicon photonics modulator waveguide. With the combination of our proprietary electro-optic polymer material and the extremely high optical field concentration in the slot waveguide modulator, the test modulators demonstrated less than 2.2 volts to operate. Initial speeds exceeded 30-35 GhZ in the telecom, 1550 nanometer frequency band. This is equivalent to four, 10Gbpsec, inorganic, lithium niobate modulators that would require approximately 12-16 volts to move the same amount of information. Our material also operates in the 1310 nanometer frequency band, which is suitable for data communications applications.

In January 2014 we created a new methodology to combine multiple chromophores into a single polymer host that significantly improves their ability to generate more powerful organic, nonlinear electro-optical polymer systems. The new synthetic chemistry process can enable multiple chromophores (dyes) to work in concert with each other within a single polymer host. This proprietary process has created two new material systems, which have demonstrated outstanding electro-optic values. In addition, we now have a significant amount of data on the thermal aging of our materials. We have demonstrated that our materials can withstand more than 2,000 hours at 110 degrees C with little to no change in electro-optic activity in our materials, which is a significant milestone. To our knowledge, this is something that has not been achieved before in any polymer. We are also concurrently coating prototype waveguides with our proprietary material system.

In February 2014 we received our first purchase order for our advanced organic nonlinear electro-optic polymer from Boulder Nonlinear Systems (BNS) of Boulder, Colorado in connection with the development of a next generation LADAR system. 

In April 2014 we entered into a sole worldwide license agreement with Corning Incorporated enabling us to integrate Corning's organic electro-optical chromophores into our portfolio of electro-optic polymer materials. The agreement allows us to use the licensed patents within a defined license field that includes communications, computing, power, and power storage applications utilizing the nonlinear optical properties of their materials. We elected to exercise our termination rights under the agreement effective January 1, 2018.

In October 2014 we submitted an order with Reynard Corporation to produce gold-layered fused silica substrates for our bleached waveguide modulators to be coated with several of our organic electro-optical polymers, which we received in early November 2014 and performance tested throughout December 2014. In May 2015, we subsequently decided to eliminate this product from our commercial development plans due to its limited commercial value, low speed characteristics, difficulty to mass-produce and limited ability to integrate with existing architectures. In lieu of this development program, a commercially viable prototype ridge waveguide modulator program was started to replace the bleached waveguide development. We believe that the ridge waveguide modulator represents a viable telecom device opportunity for the Company that does not have the inherent limitations seen in bleached waveguide structures.

In August 2015 we completed 2,500 hours of thermal aging tests of several blends of materials created by our multi-chromophore process, which included lengthy exposure to high temperatures (850C and 1100C). The data collected indicated minimal loss of electro-optical activity (R33) of our materials, which means that our organic polymers are expected to provide decades of operational performance. These results exceed previously published efforts for other organic polymers and are an important part of our commercialization effort as we begin to implement these material systems into advanced photonic devices for the telecom and datacom markets. 

Additionally, in August 2015, we completed 500+ hours of photochemical stability testing of our material candidates by exposing them to the visible light spectrum. The data collected indicated no discernible change in the chemical structures in an oxygen free environment. This stability testing was begun to help us understand more clearly the processing and manufacturing requirements of our future commercial products, and provide initial assurances to expect the same results as we move these materials into actual photonic device structures. This, in turn, has enabled us to begin initial device testing on devices that utilize our silicon photonic chips.

In October 2015, we successfully surpassed 2,000 hours of photochemical stability testing of our material candidates with little to no change in the electro-optic characteristics (R33) of our material; and, in January 2016, we successfully surpassed 4,000 hours of photochemical stability testing of our material candidates with little to no change in the electro-optic characteristics (R33) of our material. These photochemical stability test results, along with the thermal stability at 110°C, should enable our Company to demonstrate that organic polymers can compete head-to-head with inorganic crystalline legacy telecom and datacom devices which currently provide the backbone for the entire infrastructure that converts almost incalculable amounts of electronic (binary) data into pulses of light and back on a daily basis.

In November of 2015, we successfully fabricated ridge waveguide structures from our core material system. At the same time, we successfully developed a proprietary methodology to segment individual chips from our silicon wafers that contain our ridge waveguide devices. These critical steps in our process provide us with a clear path towards a commercial telecommunication device. These same processes can be used for the fabrication of modulators to be used in data centers. The individual chips are now being analyzed and passively tested in our Longmont, CO optical test facility. 

In February 2016, we successfully guided laser single-mode light through 16 of our passive ridge waveguides made entirely out of our advanced organic polymer systems, which are the building block of waveguide modulators that can achieve high modulator performance. As a result, our commercialization effort has entered the next phases of development: passive-waveguide loss measurements, followed by the development and active testing of electro-optic modulators. Utilizing continuous-wave input laser light, electro-optic modulators convert digital (binary) electrical data into output pulses of light that can be transported across fiber optic communication networks. Active testing is accomplished by applying an electrical signal to a modulator and evaluating the resulting output optical signal.

In April 2016, we successfully achieved modulation of light in our first in-house all-polymer ridge waveguide modulator prototype. This important step towards commercialization proved that our proprietary organic electro-optic polymer systems could modulate light in an in-house designed and produced polymer ridge waveguide modulator. We expect this significant achievement to eventually lead to high-speed, low input voltage modulators capable of penetrating the current market. We are still testing and modifying the poling profiles in prototype devices to duplicate the results seen in previous Teng-Man R33 material testing.

In May 2016, we broadened our photonic device development to include our new P2IC (Polymer Photonics Integrated Circuit) design platform. The P2IC design platform utilizes high-speed ridge waveguide and slot waveguide modulator designs that scale up in performance as well as down in cost structure. Furthermore, the Lightwave Logic P2IC design platform combines the best of Polymer Photonics with the best of Silicon Photonics (SiP) to create a powerful, yet scalable platform that addresses the desires of both the telecom and datacom industries. 
 
In August 2016, we gained enormous industry exposure for our first organic electro-optic polymer-enabled prototype photonic device when our board member, Michael Lebby, Ph.D., presented to the Prestigious European Conference on Optical Communication (ECOC) Exhibition, the scientific and economic case for our Company's high-performance polymer photonics for next-generation photonic integrated circuits as future competition for installed legacy photonic devices and emerging silicon photonic systems.

In August 2016, we obtained highly successful independent third-party verification of our organic polymer thin film properties from Metricon, a Company that specializes in making precision instruments designed to obtain optical measurements on thin film materials and optical waveguides. Metricon concluded a battery of scientific tests to verify the inherent properties of several of our advanced organic electro-optic polymer materials, which are currently being implemented into a series of photonic devices. Measurements by Metricon of several planar waveguide samples determined that our polymer thin film materials at 1550 nm (Telecom frequency band) should exceed industry requirements that target overall device loss at <4 dB/cm. Additionally, Metricon was also able to provide very accurate refractive index measurements on our Companys materials, which is very important for designing high-speed multi-layer polymer modulators.

In December 2016, we achieved high-speed modulation in our first all-organic polymer ridge waveguide intensity modulator prototype, which constituted one of the most significant moments in the history of our Company. Our initial "alpha" prototype device, enabled by our P2IC polymer system, demonstrated bandwidth suitable for data rates up to about 10 Gbps. This performance exceeds the telecom OC-48 standard (2.5 Gbps). This device demonstrated true amplitude (intensity) modulation in a Mach-Zehnder modulator structure incorporating our polymer waveguides. 

In April 2017 we achieved bandwidth suitable for 25Gbps data rates in an all-organic polymer ridge waveguide intensity modulator prototype, a significant improvement over our initial 10Gbps device modulator prototype. This breakthrough was significant because a 25Gbps data rate is important to the optical networking industry because this data rate is a major node to achieve 100 Gbps (using 4 channels of 25 Gbps). In July 2017 we advanced our high-speed modulation performance to satisfy 28Gbps data rates for QSFP28 standards and 100Gbps data center applications.

In September 2017 we achieved outstanding performance of our ridge waveguide Mach-Zehnder modulators ahead of schedule, with bandwidth performance levels that will enable 50Gbps modulation in fiber-optic communications. This important achievement will allow users to utilize arrays of 4 x 50Gbps polymer modulators using PAM-4 encoding to access 400Gbps data rate systems. Pulse-Amplitude Modulation (PAM-4) is an encoding scheme that can double the amount of data that can be transmitted.

In February 2018 we began the transition of moving our Newark, Delaware synthetic laboratory and our Longmont, Colorado optical testing laboratory and corporate headquarters to our new office, laboratory and research and development space located at 369 Inverness Parkway, Suite 350, Englewood, Colorado. The new 13,420 square feet Englewood facility includes fully functional 1,000 square feet of class 1,000 cleanroom, 500 square feet of class 10,000 cleanroom, chemistry laboratories, and analytic laboratories. The new Englewood facility streamlines all of our Companys research and development workflow for greater operational efficiencies. We expect to complete the transition of moving our Newark, Delaware synthetic laboratory and our Longmont, Colorado optical testing laboratory and corporate headquarters to the new Englewood facility by the end of March 2018.

As we move forward through 2018, we expect to continue building our world-class design team for both polymer materials and integrated photonics technology platform to further optimize our P2IC platform. With the now consolidated facility in Englewood, Colorado, we will complete our clean-room and laboratories so that we can keep key technologies and processes internal to the Company. We will package our modulators for customer evaluation, and will continue to design our polymers for improved data rates and lower power operation. We will engage with customers to fine tune our technology to meet customer expectations, and we will scale our technology to provide cost effective technological solutions for the fiber communications market segments. We will partner with other companies as necessary, e.g. our packaging partner in 2017/18 is allowing us to move quickly towards customer prototypes. 

The Global Photonic Device Market 

General Overview

Lightwave Logic has been reviewing the latest market data as well as its own internal data for its business strategy, and below we detail the global market dynamics both in terms of data traffic as well as how PIC based technologies will grow in the fiber communications segment of the market.

As we have already seen with products such as smart phones, lap top computers, and personal digital assistants (PDAs), Internet traffic is one of the important metrics that is being used to show activity in fiber communications, and particularly telecommunications as well as datacommunications (which includes datacenters and high-performance computing). Internet Protocol (IP) traffic has typically been used to gauge the amount of data that is being used on the internet as shown in the graph below (sourced from Cisco VNI in 2018). The metric is Exabytes per month. An Exabyte is 1E18 which is 1000 Petabytes, or 1000,000 Terabytes or a billion Gigabytes of data. As seen from the graph which has a strong growth of 22% CAGR (2015-2020), the majority of the traffic is being driven by video, traffic, and is fast approaching the metric of Zetta which is 1E21 bytes of data. Some estimates are discussing the further metric of Yotta which is 1E24 bytes of data over the next decade, which is also expected to be driven for the most part by video. 

Within the overall market trends of IP traffic growth, the internet will need to be able to support high volumes of data traffic. In order to do this, the fiber-optic infrastructure that allows data to be communicated between network nodes such as datacenters, within datacenters, and optical network switches etc., has to be upgraded. Today, fiber-optic networks are a combination of long, medium and short optical interconnects that range from 3 meters (or 1yard) to over 1000km depending on application in the optical network. Optical components, typically known as photonics components are used to build the fiber-optic infrastructure and consist of things like: laser diode, photodetectors, multipliers, modulators, transceivers etc. These are known as discrete components, while a mix of these components that are integrated or connected on a single substrate (such as silicon, InP, GaAs etc.) are called PICs (Photonic Integrated Components). The summary photonics market has been reviewed in 2017 and is shown below. The summary photonics market is forecast to grow to $43B by 2025 with a 7% CAGR (20-25) that includes both discrete and PIC photonic components. The summary photonics components market is forecasted to reach $21B in 2017. 

Within the summary photonics components market, three major segments exist: WAN (wide area networks), access, and Datacom. The WAN segment is forecast to grow to $27B by 2025 with a 19% CARG (20-25) and the Datacom segment is forecast to grow to $12.1B by 2025 with 22% CAGR (20-25). As can be seen from the graph below, the growth of the WAN and Datacom segments is forecasted to be very strong over the next decade and provide the engine for growth in the overall global photonics components market.

One of the key metrics that is needed for any overall market analysis is how photonics components will grow over the next decade from a PIC perspective. This is important as the trend to integrate photonics components is beginning to accelerate. The trend has been driven by customer applications that require smaller photonic component solutions, lower power, high data rates, larger buildings for longer interconnect lengths, and more economic in terms of $/Gbps. PIC technologies, i.e. those technologies that include integrated photonics are forecasted to grow to ~$30B by 2025 with 16% CAGR (20-25). These technologies include InP which is the current incumbent, GaAs, and other newer integrated technology solutions such as SiP (silicon photonics), polymer photonics, and dielectric photonics. The forecast of ~$30B is approximately 69% of the summary photonics components market by 2025, which represents a huge acceleration for PIC based technologies over the next decade. This also means while PIC based technologies are $7B today with 24% of the photonics components market, PIC based technologies become de facto by 2025. 
 
While the rise of PIC based technologies is exciting, what also is exciting in the photonics component market is the rise of fiber-optic transceivers. Transceivers are small boxes located at the end of each fiber-optic link that house photonics components and PIC components which send and receive data. While the global overall photonic components market is expected to reach $43B by 2025, the photonics transceivers sub-segment is forecasted to grow to $25B by this time. This represents that transceivers will accelerate to 58% of the global overall photonics market by 2025 and become a major driver for optical networking over the next decade.

The key segments in photonics based fiber-optic transceivers achieved $11.3B in 2017 with growth from 9 different segments that include: AOC, CATV, Fibre Channel, DWDM, Ethernet-datacom, WAN-client side, Radio etc., based transceivers. Three of these segments are forecasted to grow very well to achieve revenues of $25B by 2025, with the biggest contributions from DWDM, Ethernet-datacom, and WAN-client based transceivers.

The transceiver growth shows which sub-segments that will utilize small boxes at the ends of fiber-optic interconnects, it is well known that transceiver trends over the past decade have been towards smaller boxes i.e. smaller transceiver formats and footprints (such as SFF, SFP, QSFP, and many others), with higher densities of photonics components designed into them. It is expected over the forecast period that transceivers will be an excellent platform for the accelerating trends of PICs in both telecom and datacom applications. The graph below shows the PIC transceiver forecast to 2025. PIC transceivers are forecast to reach $20B by 2025 with 17% CARG (20-25) growing from $3.2B in 2017. What is more interesting is that by about 2021, PIC transceivers will lead discrete photonic component transceivers from a revenue standpoint. This means that the trend to integrate photonics components inside a transceiver is accelerating quickly, driven by the customer interest for smaller, denser, and higher performance metrics of transceivers. This trend is ideal for our polymer based integrated photonics platform to have a huge impact in the market segment over the next decade.

Within the PIC transceivers market there are a number of sub-segments that summate to $20B by 2025. The major segments that drive this forecast are Ethernet, DWDM, and WAN-client-side applications as can be seen from the graph below. In particular these segments are technologically driven by PIC based technologies that operate at 100Gbps and 400Gbps data rates that generally are considered high performance solutions.


11


Data rates and high performance of transceivers can be seen by the graph below which depicts PIC based technologies in the Ethernet sub-segment. For Ethernet applications only, transceivers are driven by 100GE based PIC technologies. The market is forecast with 100GE to grow to $4.5B by 2025 with 6% CAGR (20-25) and with 400GE to grow to $0.98B by 2025 with 16% CAGR (20-25). This is a clear drive for the PIC based transceivers in the Ethernet application is 100GE over the forecast period and sets the scene for polymer based integrated photonics to have the opportunity to grow extremely quickly.

As the Company is developing polymer based photonic devices such as fiber-optic modulators, these devices translate electric signals into optical signals and allow laser based technology to operate effectively at 50Gbps and beyond. Lasers with modulator are used in fiber communication systems to transfer data over fiber-optic networks today and are expected to be a key driver in photonics components for PIC based technological solutions over the next decade. Optical data transfer using lasers and modulators is significantly faster and more efficient than transfer technologies using only electric signals, permitting more cost-effective use of bandwidth for broadband Internet and voice services.

Our Target Markets

Cloud computing and data centers

Big data is a general term used to describe the voluminous amount of unstructured and semi-structured data a Company creates -- data that would take too much time and cost too much money to load into a relational database for analysis. Companies are looking to cloud computing in their data centers to access all the data. Inherent speed and bandwidth limits of traditional solutions and the potential of organic polymer devices offer an opportunity to increase the bandwidth, reduce costs and improve speed of access.

The overall square footage in datacenters has been growing rapidly over the past 5 years, and is expected to continue this trend over the next decade. Data centers are confronted with the problem of moving vast amounts of data not only around the data center itself, but also between data centers. The size of these data center links are often measured in kilometers and employ optical modulators to convert stored electrical/binary information to optical and back. Links that are shorter than 500 meters and operate at approximately 10Gbps can employ direct modulation, which accomplishes modulation by mechanically turning a laser on and off. However, for links greater than 500 meters and higher data rates such as 25Gbps, 40Gbps, and beyond, it is necessary to employ optical modulators. We intend to target optical devices that are aimed at the 500m to 10km distance segment of the market that operate at 25Gbps and higher data rates. These are single mode fiber links and require polymer optical devices that operate in single optical mode. While some data center customers are planning their architectures using single mode fiber links even below 500m, others are focusing on cost-performance to make their decisions for their particular architectures. Our technology is both single mode and scalable in both increased data rates and low cost, which means that it can be implemented in either data center application depending on how we achieve the customer metrics and specifications. We believe that our single mode modulator solutions will not only be competitive at 500m to 10km link distances at 25Gbps data rates and beyond, but also at distances below 500m at 25Gbps and beyond depending on the customer architecture designs. 

Telecommunications/Data Communications

The telecommunications industry has evolved from transporting traditional analogue voice data over copper wire into the movement of digital voice and data. Telecommunication companies are faced with the enormous increasing challenges to keep up with the resulting tremendous explosion in demand for bandwidth. This has been further exacerbated by a recent trend for content providers to store large amounts of data closer to the end user. This results in enormous demands on telecommunication metro networks (less than 10 Kilometers in length) and their ability to facilitate the transportation of content. 

We believe that our ridge waveguide modulator, when completed will have the potential to address several segments within telecommunications networks.

Industry issues of scaling

The key issues facing the fiber-optic communications industry are the economic progress and scalability of any PIC based technological platform. The polymer platform is unique in that it is truly scalable. Scalable means being able to scale up for high speed data rates, while simultaneously being able to scale down in cost. This allows a competitive cost per data rate or cost per Gbps metric to be achieved. 

Fiber optic datacentre and high-performance computing customers want to achieve the metric of $1/Gbps @ 400Gbps (this essentially means a single mode fiber optic link that has a total cost of $400 and operates with a data rate of 400Gbps à which also means that each transceiver at each end of the fiber optic link must be able to be priced at $200), but as industry tries to match this target, it is already falling behind as can be seen in the Figure below which plots generic typical PIC based technology:


13


In the above figures (where the left-hand graph is a linear vertical scale, and the right-hand graph is a log scale), it can be seen that the orange curve plots the customer expectation, while the other color curves show $/Gbps improvement over time for various high-speed data rate transceivers using PIC based technologies. A gap is appearing between what customer expect and what the technologists can produce.

Polymers play an important role in PICs over the next decade as they can reduce or close the gap between customer expectations and technical performance through effective scaling increase of high performance with low cost. This is shown in the Figure below how polymers have the potential to scale to the needs of the customers over the next 3-5years.


Some of the things needed to achieve the scaling performance of polymers in n integrated photonics platform is within sight today: 

1)
 Increased r33 (which leads to very low Vpi in modulator devices) and we are currently optimizing our polymers for this.
 2)
 Increase temperature stability so that the polymers can operate at broader temperature ranges effective, where we have made significant progress over the past few years.
 3)
 Low optical loss in waveguides and active/passive devices for improved optical budget metrics which is currently an ongoing development program at our Company
 4)
 Higher levels of hermeticity for lower cost packaging of optical sub-assemblies within a transceiver module, where our advanced designs are being implemented into polymer-based packages.

Our Business Strategy

Our business strategy anticipates that our revenue stream will be derived from one or some combination of the following: (i) technology licensing for specific product application; (ii) joint venture relationships with significant industry leaders; or (iii) the production and direct sale of our own electro-optic device components. Our objective is to be a leading provider of proprietary technology and know-how in the electro-optic device market. In order to meet this objective, we intend to:

Create Organic Polymer-Enabled Electro-Optic Modulators

We intend to utilize our proprietary optical polymer technology to create an initial portfolio of commercially feasible electro-optic polymer product devices and applications for various markets, including telecommunications, data communications and data centers. 

We expect our initial product device line will be a high-speed 4 x 25 Gbps ridge waveguide modulator to compete in the growing 100 Gbps modulator market.

Continue to Expand Our Intellectual Property Portfolio and Reliance on Trade Secrets

We plan to continuously advance the development of unique organic electro-optic polymer materials along with proprietary designs and device configurations. We intend to protect our technology by filing patent applications where appropriate or by obtaining exclusive technology rights where available. However, in some cases, we will refrain from protecting certain proprietary with patents in favor of trade secrets.
Maintain/Develop Strategic Relationships Private Firms, and Academic Institutions

Since the formation of our Company, we have had numerous strategic relationships with government agencies that have provided us with funding and access to important technology. From the time that we developed our own in-house testing capability and Class 100 clean room facility in Longmont, Colorado we have attempted to minimize outside academic and government agency relationships.

After completion of our initial prototype ridge waveguide, we will seek to enter into partnership/JV discussions with outside parties to co-develop a slot waveguide modulator.

Continue to Recruit Technical Expertise

In December 2011, we retained Dr. Frederick Leonberger, PhD as our Senior Advisor. Dr. Leonberger is the former Chief Technology Officer of JDS Uniphase, Inc. We previously retained EOvation Advisors LLC, a technology and business advisory firm founded by Dr. Frederick Leonberger, as a consultant to the Company. Dr. Leonberger is presently assisting our Company with strategic planning and the design of optical modulators that we intend to develop. In May 2017, Dr. Leonberger was elected to our Board of Directors and serves as a member of the operations committee and assists with the technical direction and strategy of the company.

Our Proprietary Products in Development

As part of a two-pronged marketing strategy, our Company is developing several optical devices, which are in various stages of development and that utilize our organic nonlinear optical materials. They include:
Ridge Waveguide Modulator

Our ridge electro-optic waveguide modulator was designed and fabricated in our Longmont, Colorado laboratory. The fabrication of our first in-house device is significant to our entire device program and is an important starting point for modulators that are being developed for target markets. We have multiple generations of new materials that we will soon be optimizing for this specific design. In September 2017 we announced that our initial alpha prototype ridge waveguide modulator, enabled by our P2IC polymer system, demonstrated bandwidth performance levels that will enable 50Gbps modulation in fiber-optic communications. This device demonstrated true amplitude (intensity) modulation in a Mach-Zehnder modulator structure incorporating our polymer waveguides. This important achievement will allow users to utilize arrays of 4 x 50Gbps polymer modulators using PAM-4 encoding to access 400Gbps data rate systems. Pulse-Amplitude Modulation (PAM-4) is an encoding scheme that can double the amount of data that can be transmitted. These ridge waveguide modulators are currently being packaged with our partner and will be available for evaluation by potential customers in 2018. In parallel, we are simulating and modeling the modulators for scalability to higher data rates above 50Gbps and lower cost structures that will be competitive with incumbent technology. This provides our technology platform with higher levels of scalability and will provide potential customers with technological solutions that they are currently looking for.

The ridge waveguide modulator represents our first commercially viable device, and targets metro networks (< 10Km) within large scale telecommunications and data communications networks and represents at least a $300M per year market opportunity for us. 

Slot Waveguide Modulator

Our functional polymer photonics slot waveguide modulator utilizes an existing modulator structure with one of our proprietary electro-optic polymer material systems as the enabling material layer, and is functional as an operating prototype device. 

Preliminary testing and initial data on our polymer photonics slot waveguide modulators demonstrated several promising characteristics. The tested polymer photonic chip had a 1-millimeter square footprint, enabling the possibility of sophisticated integrated optical circuits on a single silicon substrate. In addition, the waveguide structure was approximately 1/20 the length of a typical inorganic-based silicon photonics modulator waveguide. 

With the combination of our proprietary electro-optic polymer material and the extremely high optical field concentration in the slot waveguide modulator, the test modulators demonstrated less than 2.2 volts to operate. Initial speeds exceeded 30-35 GHz in the telecom, 1550 nanometer frequency band. This is equivalent to four, 10Gb/sec, inorganic, lithium niobate modulators that would require approximately 12-16 volts to move the same amount of information. 

Our material also operates in the 1550 nanometer frequency band, which is suitable for data communications applications. We continued with our collaborative development of our SOH/ Polymer photonic slot waveguide modulator in 2014 and continued our collaboration with an associated third-party research group in 2017 and expect to see initial results in 2018.

Our Long-Term Device Development Goal - Multichannel Integrated Nanophotonic Transceiver

While we consider our ridge waveguide and slot waveguide modulators currently under development to be commercially viable products, in another sense they are intermediate steps in the development of our long-term goal a multichannel integrated nanophotonic transceiver for application in data communications. 


16


The transceiver consists of a silicon photonic chip fabricated with nonlinear polymer infused modulators (polymer photonic), multiplexers, demultiplexers, detectors and grating fiber couplers to an external light source. The CMOS-compatible optical modulators are key components for future silicon-based photonic transceivers. Our solution, the silicon-organic hybrid (polymer photonic) platform has been proposed and is being prototyped. In the polymer photonic approach, the optical signal is guided by a silicon waveguide while an organic cladding provides the electro-optic effect.

Other Potential Applications for Our Products

We believe that there are myriad potential applications for our organic polymer materials and devices outside of our initial focus of data communications, telecommunications and data centers. These potential applications encompass areas as diverse as military, space, optical computing, and life sciences. We believe that as viable organic polymer materials gain acceptance, their increased flexibility, functionality and low cost will create new applications that may not yet be technically feasible. Two such future applications with revolutionary potential are:

All-Optical Switches

An all-optical switch is one that enables signals in optical fibers or networks to be selectively switched from one fiber or circuit to another. Many device designs have been developed and commercialized in todays telecom networks to effect optical switching by using mechanical or electrical control elements to accomplish the switching event. Future networks will require all-optical switches that can be more rapidly activated with a low energy and short duration optical (light) control pulse. 

Multi-Channel Optical Modem

The availability of low cost electro-optic modulators will enable low cost multichannel optical modems that will use many wavelengths in parallel and employ high efficiency modulation techniques such as QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation). Such modems would enable an order of magnitude increase in the Internet capacity of legacy fiber. Our Company is in the early feasibility stage of such a multichannel optical modem.
Our Past Government Program Participation

Our Company has been a participant in several vital government sponsored research and development programs with various government agencies that protect the interests of our country. The following is a list of some of the various divisions of government agencies that have provided us with advisory, financial and/or materials support in the pursuit of high-speed electro-optic materials. We are not currently partnered with, strategically related to, or financially supported by any governmental agency at this time, however, we may explore future opportunities as our Company grows and gains the additional resources and personnel necessary to support these efforts. Our previous relationships included:

· | National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) 
· | Properties Branch of the Army Research Laboratory on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Aberdeen, Maryland.
· | Defense Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA) 
· | Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division in China Lake, California 
· | Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio

Our Competition

Competitive Technologies - PIC Based Technologies

PIC technologies have historically been driven using III-V compound semiconductors, namely InP, although GaAs remains a strong PIC platform, and is expected to strengthen via the VCSEL based 3D sensing applications. Indium Phosphide has been used since the 1980s as the first PIC platform with laser modulator chips where both the laser and modulator were fabricated monolithically. Since the 1980s, there have been InP based transmitters, receivers, and other functional elements that all support the fiber-communications industry. In fact, over the past 3 decades it has the been the fiber communications industry that has driven the increased performance, miniaturization and simplicity in packaging for PIC based technologies. Also, back in the 1980s, optoelectronics was the key word to describe having both electronic and photonic functions or devices on a single chip. This was known in early publications as an optoelectronics integrated circuit (OEIC). Today optoelectronics is synonymous with photonics, and hence the common-place use of photonics integrated circuits for PICs. 

In the below figure, it can be seen in red that the incumbent technology for PICs is InP. InP is capable of providing a number of devices and opportunities in both electronics as well as photonics. InP main weakness from a function standpoint is that although it can provide HFETs, JFETs, bipolar electronic devices, it has not been able to successfully penetrate LSI, or VLSI with digital IC circuitry. Chips such as ASICs are not practically available with the InP platform  mostly due to advancement in electronic transistor design, and also through limited maturity in large format wafer manufacturing. Today the majority of InP fabrication is based on 4 or 100mm wafers, and only in the past year have folks been seriously looking at 6 or 150mm InP wafer infrastructure. From the photonics standpoint, there are very good reasons why InP is the incumbent technology  it provides world class performance in lasers, modulators, simple electronics such as drivers and TIAs (transimpedance amplifiers), as well as highly performing active and passive devices such as SOAs, waveguides, spot-size converters, and mux/demux blocks such as AWG and Eschelle gratings. 


18


Over the past decade, the rise of silicon-based photonics has accelerated quickly (as can be seen in blue in the Figure). Silicon has a huge history in electronics, and its been said by many that if the existing infrastructure could be utilized effectively, then the cost of producing photonics with similar fabrication, design, testing, and simulation tools, would become competitive with the current incumbent technology: InP. As can be seen by the figure, silicon is capable of handling many photonics devices in addition to all electronic functionality with CMOS and BiCMOS based technologies. The only photonic device that remains impossible (at least for the time being) is the emitter or laser where light is generated. This has spawned a new segment for silicon photonics (SiP) where engineers and scientists have developed creative ways to implement InP into device, wafer, and epi-designs that are silicon based. These solutions are typically referred to as heterogeneous solutions where both InP and silicon are utilized to create PIC platforms with emitter or laser-based functionality.

While the red area of the Figure represents the incumbent technology InP, the blue areas, Silicon Photonics, the middle areas that are shaded green represent PIC based technologies that can utilize either III-V compound semiconductor platforms such as InP, GaAs, even GaN, as well as silicon platforms such as silicon wafers, and various combinations of silicon-based materials such as SOI (silicon on insulator), SiGe etc. The green areas are represented by both polymers and dielectric materials that can be deposited onto either silicon or III-V material wafers. These combinations of technology allow flexibility in PIC designs where both polymers and dielectrics can provide a multitude of active and passive photonic devices such as: waveguides (W/G), spot size converters (SSC), modulators (such as Mach Zehnder and slot types), multipliers and demultipliers (Mux/Demux variants such as AWGs, MMI, and Echelle gratings). The interesting part of the polymer and dielectric technology is that combinations of active and passive devices can be mixed and matched with either III-V compound devices as well as silicon based, heterogeneous based devices to design more effective and efficient PICs. For polymers, very low voltage can be utilized for low cost, low power consumption, very high-speed modulators that can be deposited onto a semiconductor platform. For dielectric photonics, very low temperature sensitivity mux/demux devices (such as athermal designs) can be deposited onto a semiconductor platform. As can be seen from the Figure, polymer and dielectric technology suffers from that the fact that high density ICs and laser-based emitters are not available but could be integrated with the appropriate designs for the PIC with III-V compound semiconductors and/or silicon based technology that have both DSP/ASIC type circuits and laser emitters. 

PIC technologies have a number various and broad applications as can be seen by the Figure below. In this Figure applications range from fiber optic communications, self-driving vehicles, sensing, internet of things, bio-photonics, healthcare, industrial, military, high performance computing etc.


19


PIC technologies are based upon semiconductor wafers (such as III-V compound semiconductors  InP, GaAs etc.) as well as silicon wafers (which can be tailored to become SiGe heterogeneous, SOI, etc.). As these platforms are semiconductor based, the wafers are processed in fabs or fabrication facilities to produce devices. As a general rule, silicon has the largest wafers with 8 (200mm) and 12 (300mm) format discs. GaAs typically is running 3 (75mm), 4 (100mm) and 6 (150mm) wafers in production fabs or fabrication plants around the world. There is an expectation that GaAs will eventually move to 8 (200mm) wafers in the next 5 years. InP is in production today on 2 (50mm), 3 (75mm) and 4 (100mm) wafers with an expectation to move to 6 (150mm) in the next 5 years. Heterogeneous solutions with silicon photonics that utilize materials such as SiGe and InP are typically 8 (200mm) and 12 (300mm) format wafers. Polymer photonics can be deposited on either III-V compound semiconductor wafers as well as silicon wafers which makes it suitable for the next generation of PIC based technological platforms for the fiber communications industry. 

The supply chain for the PIC industry starts with the wafer development and continues through epitaxial growth, device fabrication, optical sub-assembly, module or transceiver builds, and sub-systems which are implemented into optical networking applications. Within these supply chain segments, a number of combinations of technology can be utilized. For example, CMOS IC circuits can be fabricated onto silicon wafers together with silicon photonics, heterogeneous solutions, that could have the advantage of polymer active devices, and dielectric passive devices on board. InP may be combined with polymer photonics to house on-board or on-wafer emitters to source light for the optical signaling with modulators. Included in the wafers can be combinations of electrical and optical circuitry. Electrical circuitry is usually set up as both as single as well as multilevel interconnects. Optical circuitry is usually set up as a waveguide or optical layer as part of the device fabrication design. PICs can interconnect electrical devices with photonic devices, and also increase chip functionality through the use of electrical and optical active and passive device solutions. Polymer technologies can provide active device function through for example Mach Zehnder modulators, as well as providing passive device function with waveguides, multipliers, and demultipliers. 

Competitors

The markets we are targeting for our electro-optic polymer technology are intensely competitive. Among the largest fiber-optic component manufactures are Finisar, Lumentum, Oclaro, NeoPhotonics, Molex, Avago. Additionally, the five largest inorganic modulator component manufacturers hold approximately 85% of the electro-optic modulator component market. They are Lumentum, Sumitomo, Oclaro, Fujitsu and ThorLabs. These companies are heavily invested in the production of crystalline-based electro-optic modulator technologies, as well as the development of novel manufacturing techniques and modulator designs.
Our Plan to Compete

We believe that as our organic polymer technology gains industry acceptance, we will be poised to obtain a significant portion of the component manufacturing market. Electro-optic polymers demonstrate several advantages over other technologies, such as inorganic-based technologies, due to their reduced manufacturing and processing costs, higher performance and lower power requirements. Our patented organic polymers and future electro-optic photonic devices have demonstrated significant stability advantages over our known competitor's materials.

We believe the principal competitive factors in our target markets are:


· | The ability to develop and commercialize highly stable optical polymer-based materials and optical devices in commercial quantities.
· | The ability to obtain appropriate patent and proprietary rights protection. 
· | Lower cost, high production yield for these products. 
· | The ability to enable integration and implement advanced technologies. 
· | Strong sales and marketing, and distribution channels for access to products. 


We believe that our current business planning will position our Company to compete adequately with respect to these factors. Our future success is difficult to predict because we are an early stage company with all of our potential products still in development.


20


Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater research and product development capabilities and financial, scientific, marketing and human resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may:


· | Succeed in developing products that are equal to or superior to our potential products or that achieve greater market acceptance than our potential products. 
· | Devote greater resources to developing, marketing or selling their products. 
· | Respond quickly to new or emerging technologies or scientific advances and changes in customer requirements, which could render our technologies or potential products obsolete.
· | Introduce products that make the continued development of our potential products uneconomical. 
· | Obtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit our ability to develop and commercialize our potential products. 
· | Withstand price competition more successfully than we can. 
· | Establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our prospective customers. 
· | Take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can.

Legal Proceedings

We are not currently a party to or engaged in any material legal proceedings and we are not aware of any litigation or threatened litigation of a material nature. However, we may be subject to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business from time to time.
