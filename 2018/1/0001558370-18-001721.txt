     Item 1.  Business
     We are a leading genome editing company dedicated to developing transformative genomic medicines with the aim to treat a broad range of serious diseases. The promise of genomic medicines is supported by the advancing knowledge of the human genome, and harnessing the progress in technologies for cell therapy, gene therapy, and, most recently, genome editing. We believe this progress sets the stage for us to create unprecedented medicines with the potential to have a durable benefit for patients. At Editas Medicine, our core capability in genome editing uses the technology known as CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats) with which we can create molecules that efficiently and specifically edit DNA. Our mission is to translate the promise of this science into a broad class of medicines to help people living with serious diseases around the world. 
 We have developed a proprietary genome editing platform based on CRISPR technology and we continue to expand its capabilities. CRISPR uses a protein‑RNA complex composed of an enzyme, including either Cas9 (CRISPR associated protein 9) or Cpf1 (CRISPR from Prevotella and Francisella 1), bound to a guide RNA molecule designed to recognize a particular DNA sequence. Once the complex binds to the DNA sequence it was designed to recognize, the complex makes a specific cut in the DNA, ultimately triggering the cell’s DNA repair machinery to change the targeted sequence. Our platform consists of four interrelated components: nuclease and guide RNA engineering, delivery, control and specificity, and directed editing. These interrelated components are designed to develop medicines that specifically address a wide variety of genetic targets, reach the site of disease safely and effectively, tightly and specifically control the editing process, and drive the right kind of genetic repair. 
 We believe we are the only human genome editing company with a platform that includes CRISPR/Cas9, CRISPR/Cpf1, and engineered forms of both of these CRISPR systems. Because of the broad nature of this platform, we believe we can create genome editing molecules for almost any site in the human genome. Each of our product candidates derives from our platform, and we plan to continue to use our platform to create and advance a broad range of experimental medicines for both genetically defined and genetically treatable diseases.

Our initial product development strategy is to primarily target genetically defined diseases with a focus on debilitating illnesses where there are poor or no approved treatments and where the genetic basis of disease is well understood. A genetically defined disease may be treated by correcting a disease causing gene, whereas a genetically treatable disease is a disease that does not necessarily have a single, disease causing gene, but which nonetheless may be treated by editing genes to ameliorate or eliminate the signs or symptoms of that disease. While our discovery efforts have ranged across several different diseases and therapeutic areas, the two areas where our programs are more mature are ocular diseases and engineered cell medicines.
  In ocular diseases, our most advanced program is designed to address Leber Congenital Amaurosis type 10 (“LCA10”), which is a specific genetic form of vision loss that leads to blindness in childhood. LCA10 has no approved therapies in either the United States or European Union, and we are aware of only one potential treatment in clinical trials in the United States and Europe. LCA10 patients have a mutation in the CEP290 gene that causes the disease. We have demonstrated that our lead product candidate, EDIT-101, can achieve high levels of editing of the CEP290 gene in human retinal tissue that has been explanted and maintained in vitro and in the retinas of non-human primates in vivo. We have initiated a clinical natural history study to evaluate the clinical course and characteristics of LCA10 more extensively, and we aim to file an investigational new drug application (“IND”) by mid-2018 for EDIT-101. We believe results to date in LCA10 validate our platform technology, including its potential application to other ocular diseases, such as Usher Syndrome 2A (“USH2A”) and recurrent ocular Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (“HSV-1”) infection, as well as diseases of other organs and tissues.
 In March 2017 we entered into a strategic alliance and option agreement with Allergan Pharmaceuticals International Limited (“Allergan”), which we believe has the potential to expand and enhance our research and development efforts for ocular diseases. Under this agreement, Allergan received exclusive access and the option to license up to five of our genome editing ocular programs, including our lead program for LCA10, and will be responsible for development and commercialization of any program with respect to which it exercises its option. For

LCA10 and one additional program, we retain the option to co-develop and co-commercialize products in the United States. We received an upfront payment of $90.0 million and have the potential to receive greater than $1.0 billion in contingent milestone payments, as well as high single-digit royalties. With Allergan, we aim to advance a broad portfolio of first-in-class genome editing medicines to treat serious diseases of the eye.
 In addition to developing medicines for ocular diseases, the development of engineered cell medicines is a core part of our research effort and product pipeline. We believe that advances in genome editing will both improve the characteristics of current cellular medicines and also expand the universe of cellular medicines that can be created. To this end, we have developed capabilities to efficiently and specifically edit T cells and hematopoietic stem cells, which we believe have the potential to lead to best-in-class medicines for cancer and hemoglobinopathies. More broadly, we believe that our editing capabilities can be applied to many additional cell types.
 In May 2015 we established a collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (“Juno Therapeutics”) to develop engineered T cell medicines for cancer. These therapies have the potential to substantially advance the field of cancer immunotherapy and expand the range of cancers that can be treated with engineered T cells. Under the collaboration, we received an upfront payment of $25.0 million, and we have received two milestone payments totaling $5.0 million related to technical progress in research programs under the collaboration. We also have the potential to receive approximately $700.0 million in aggregate in potential milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties. In addition, we are eligible to receive research support of up to $22.0 million over the initial five year research term, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the collaboration. 
 We are also developing multiple gene editing approaches to treating hemoglobinopathies. These programs take advantage of our genome editing capabilities in hematopoietic stem cells (“HSCs”), which include two distinct genome editing approaches at the hemoglobin gene locus. We believe one or both of these approaches has the potential to effectively and durably treat sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. 
 Every decade over the past 40 years, an important class of medicines has emerged, such as recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and RNA‑based drugs. These new categories of medicines have brought forth important therapies for previously untreated diseases. In our view, genome editing with CRISPR has the potential to be one of the next major new categories. At Editas Medicine, we believe we can make that potential a reality.

In addition, we aim to have a pipeline characterized by potential best-in-class medicines and to be a company with the leading genome editing platform and organizational culture.
 Our Core Capability — Genome Editing
 Humans possess a genome sequence of roughly three billion base pairs of nucleotides, the building blocks of the DNA double helix. DNA serves as the blueprint for cellular structure and function. Small changes, or mutations, can occur in the sequence of base pairs of our DNA. At the molecular level, these mutations can be categorized as single base pair changes, small insertions or deletions, large deletions, duplications, or repetitive sequence expansions. A mutation could occur on one or both alleles, or copies, of a gene in a cell. In some cases, these mutations can lead to a failure to produce proteins that are necessary for normal function or the production of abnormal proteins, either of which can cause disease. Abnormal proteins can interfere with the function of the normal protein or lead to a new deleterious effect called a toxic gain of function. Genetically defined diseases vary dramatically in their pathologies, their sites of manifestation, and the specific natures of their root causes. Familiar examples of genetically defined diseases include cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Huntington’s disease, retinitis pigmentosa, and sickle cell anemia.
 Major investments in the human genome project, clinical sample collection and characterization, and the subsequent development of low cost and rapid DNA sequencing and informatics tools have revolutionized the understanding of genetically defined diseases and paved the way for advancing the field of genomic medicine. Genomic medicine harnesses the knowledge of genetics to guide the care of patients and create new therapies. There are several technologies that have the potential to create medicines in this field. These technologies can be grouped into two broad categories: gene therapy and genome editing. Each approach seeks to address genetically defined diseases at the level of DNA. 
 Gene therapy is an approach whereby a new gene is transferred into cells to augment a defective gene. This can either be through insertion of the new gene directly into a patient’s DNA without specific regard to the site of insertion or delivering a piece of DNA to exist alongside the patient’s genome without being integrated into it. Gene therapy

transfers new DNA into cells, however it does not remove or modify the defective DNA and it generally introduces the new genetic material in a location where it is not subject to the cell’s normal control and feedback mechanisms. This approach is suited for a finite set of genetically defined diseases
 Genome editing is the process of revising, removing, or repairing defective DNA in situ. In general, genome editing corrects the defective DNA in its native location, and consequently the repaired genetic region retains the cell’s normal control and feedback mechanisms. Genome editing typically takes advantage of naturally occurring DNA repair mechanisms, including non-homologous end joining (“NHEJ”) and homology directed repair (“HDR”), to achieve its desired therapeutic outcome. Edits that are repaired by NHEJ typically disrupt a gene or eliminate a disease causing mutation. Edits that are repaired by HDR, including targeted insertion, aim to correct or replace aberrant DNA sequences. The diversity of genetic drivers of disease demands a variety of solutions. Genome editing has the potential to deliver a variety of types of genome modification to address a broad range of genetically defined diseases.
 Advantages of CRISPR for Genome Editing
 CRISPR technology uses a protein‑RNA complex composed of a type of enzyme, referred to as a DNA endonuclease, bound to an RNA molecule, referred to as a guide RNA, that has been designed to recognize a particular DNA sequence. A DNA endonuclease is an enzyme that cleaves DNA. This combination of a DNA endonuclease and a guide RNA only bind and cut DNA when two criteria are met: first, the protein recognizes a short DNA specific to the enzyme called the protospacer adjacent motif (“PAM”), and second, the appropriate portion of the guide RNA matches the adjacent DNA sequence. The PAM sequence that is recognized by the DNA endonuclease creates a second layer of recognition in addition to the guide RNA. We believe that CRISPR technology has three principal advantages for genome editing:

· | Rapid, comprehensive, and systematic identification of product candidates. The key targeting mechanism for the endonuclease, whether it is Cas9 or Cpf1, is a guide RNA, which can be rapidly replaced with a different guide RNA or optimized by changes as small as a single nucleotide. This allows for the flexible design, synthesis, and testing of hundreds of guide RNA/endonuclease combinations for each genetic target in order to find those that cut the DNA target with the optimal efficiency and specificity. In contrast, other commonly used DNA nucleases for genome editing have inherently limited flexibility. For example, zinc finger nucleases, engineered meganucleases, and transcription activator‑like effector nucleases (“TALENs”) use proteins for DNA sequence recognition to bring the endonuclease to the site of the genome where cleavage is desired, requiring the creation of an entirely new protein for each target site.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Simultaneous and efficient targeting of multiple sites. In CRISPR technology, multiple guide RNAs can be provided along with the same endonuclease, enabling the simultaneous and efficient targeting of multiple sites. This ability to target multiple DNA sequences expands the applicability of CRISPR technology and also creates the potential for self‑regulating systems that control exposure to the editing machinery. To address more than one target, other genome editing technologies require the engineering, characterization, manufacture, and delivery of distinct nuclease proteins for each target.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ability to achieve a range of different types of edits. The inherent differences in Cas9 and Cpf1 and the availability of different engineered variants of both enzymes allow for different types of cuts for genome editing. We are able to make a blunt cut, cut either strand of the DNA, or create overhangs of differing length. This may be a critical component of improved HDR‑driven approaches because the type of DNA cut can influence the type of repair mechanism used by a cell in response to that cut. We believe the ability to modify CRISPR technology to allow for different types of cuts will expand the potential of our genome editing platform.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Our Genome Editing Platform
 We have developed a proprietary genome editing platform consisting of four interrelated components that are designed to address four key goals of genome editing:

· | creating a comprehensive toolbox for robust and selective genome engineering;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
 7

 


· | providing efficient and targeted delivery to any tissue or cell;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | effecting spatial and temporal control of gene editing and specificity; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | orchestrating the cellular response to ensure accurate and precise genome editing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We believe that the developments we have made in our genome editing platform position us to be able to identify and develop innovative genome editing therapies targeting a wide variety of diseases. All of our programs to develop medicines leverage aspects of this platform while also providing insights that help improve our ongoing and future drug development capabilities. We believe our genome editing platform forms the basis for our ongoing leadership in the field and differentiates us from other companies working in genome editing.
 Nuclease and Guide RNA Engineering
 We use our genome editing platform to identify and optimize both the enzyme, including Cas9 and Cpf1, as well as advanced forms of each, and the guide RNA molecule, to create what we believe will be the optimal endonuclease‑guide RNA complex for a given disease target. We have made substantial advances in the characterization and modification of different natural and engineered variants of Cas9 and Cpf1 enzymes and in the design, synthesis, modification, analysis, and characterization of guide RNAs. We believe the diversity of the Cas9 and Cpf1 enzymes that we are currently employing and those that we are continuing to further develop and characterize have the potential to provide us with a competitive advantage as we develop a range of products with different technical needs. We believe our systematic approach to measurement of both the efficiency and specificity of multiple possible enzyme and guide RNA combinations enables us to optimize the identification of lead molecules to progress into more advanced testing. Our aim is to continue to develop new engineered Cas9 and Cpf1 enzymes with altered PAM specificities, different DNA cutting capabilities, and additional advanced properties. For example, we are using directed evolution, a form of guided protein engineering, to develop Cas9 enzymes that have higher fidelity than naturally occurring Cas9. We believe that further developing our nuclease and guide RNA engineering capabilities will allow us to further broaden the range of diseases we can treat while at the same time ensuring that our products have the best possible safety profiles.
 We have characterized different Cas9 and Cpf1 enzymes for several reasons. Firstly, a smaller enzyme will have advantages for delivering the endonuclease using a viral vector due to the inherent size limitations of most such delivery systems. For example, the Cas9 enzyme from Staphylococcus aureus (“S. aureus” or “SaCas9”) is significantly smaller than that from Streptococcus pyogenes (“S. pyogenes” or “SpCas9”) (3,159 vs. 4,104 base pairs), and this is important when working with adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) as a delivery vector, which has an effective packaging limit of approximately 4,700 base pairs. Secondly, identifying Cas9 and Cpf1 enzymes with different editing properties will expand the number of potential editing sites in the human genome. As shown below, the range of natural and engineered variants of Cas9 and Cpf1 have significantly expanded the number of sites in the human genome that we can potentially target. As compared to the most commonly used, naturally occurring version of Cas9, from the bacterial species S. pyogenes, the range of endonucleases in our platform can target approximately ten times as many genomic sites. Thus, while the S. pyogenes Cas9 can target approximately 1 in 10 bases in the human genome, we have the potential to hit over 95% of all bases due to the wide range of endonucleases at our disposal.

 Comparison of Number of Genomic Sites Targetable by Various Enzymes and Variants

 In order to accelerate and standardize the selection of guide RNAs, we have created proprietary analytical software that supports guide RNA design through single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, specificity prediction, and assessment of relative importance of potential off target sites. 
 Of critical importance in determining the activity and specificity of an endonuclease-guide RNA complex is understanding the quality and composition of the guide RNA. The ability to understand the quality and composition of the guide RNA will be an essential component to developing product candidates that have the potential to be safe and efficacious medicines. We have developed significant analytical and synthetic capabilities as a result of acquiring assets and capabilities of i2 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and certain of its affiliated companies in January 2018. In addition to state of the art mass spectrometry and sequencing methodologies to understand the absolute composition of our guide RNAs, we have developed two-step synthesis methods which results in guide RNAs which we believe are significantly superior to those generated by other approaches. This method allows us to independently synthesize and purify guide RNAs in multiple parts and covalently couple them using a proprietary catalyst-free chemistry. These covalently coupled, dual guide RNAs retain the advantages afforded by a single guide RNA and we believe are of higher quality than a guide RNA made by a single synthesis reaction. We believe this method will lead to higher quality genome editing medicines.
 Delivery
 Our genome editing platform includes multiple modular delivery modes that can be efficiently adapted to deliver different CRISPR genome editing components to address the specific needs of each disease targeted. Our strategy is to leverage existing delivery technologies to target cell types of interest while developing next generation capabilities as warranted. We are currently exploring, and will continue to explore, a variety of delivery approaches, including AAVs, lipid nanoparticles (“LNPs”), and the use of electroporation. For example, we have taken advantage of the smaller S. aureus Cas9 and existing AAV technology to construct an “all‑in‑one” viral vector that is able to deliver the DNA coding for the nuclease protein and one or two guide RNAs directly to cells. We believe our ability to configure all the components for genome editing in an “all‑in‑one” AAV vector has substantial advantages for manufacturing and delivery compared to approaches that rely on multiple vectors. In addition, we have also made substantial advances in the ex vivo delivery of CRISPR systems to mature human T cells and hematopoietic stem cells derived from the bone marrow. We have been able to demonstrate greater than 90% ex vivo editing on multiple genetic targets simultaneously in human T cells and greater than 75% ex vivo editing in hematopoietic stem cells using ribonucleoprotein complexes, which consist of the Cas9 or Cpf1 endonuclease complexed with its guide RNA. These results are consistent across multiple cell donors and multiple target genes.  Control and Specificity
 Control of cellular exposure to the endonuclease‑guide RNA complex and specificity of the DNA cut are important to optimizing the location and duration of editing activity. We believe these features are critical to designing medicines that are both safe and effective, and we are developing and applying technologies in these areas. We strive to identify, measure, and eliminate off‑target activity in a systematic and scalable manner as we optimize our molecules. To 

 
 
 9

 
accomplish this, we have combined multiple orthogonal methods in the design, testing, and optimization process. Our strategy to assess specificity during the research stage includes:

· | Establish industry‑leading computational tools to design guide RNAs. In order to design highly selective guide RNAs, we compare the targeted DNA sequence to the sequence of the entire human genome to identify all sequences that have significant similarity to the targeted DNA sequence. Based on our internal algorithms, we eliminate any guide RNAs that have certain defined degrees of similarity to other sites across the genome. We continually refine our guide RNA design algorithms based on results from large‑scale guide RNA screens and further confirmation and refinement experiments. We expect that this will enhance our ability to design efficient and specific guide RNAs as our database expands over time.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Use multiple unbiased, comprehensive methods to empirically assess specificity in vitro. While computational tools are helpful, they are only a starting point and are insufficient to understand specificity completely. It is critical to make and test molecules in unbiased assays to assess the specificity of their activity. We use multiple methods to empirically assess specificity in order to test for a variety of potential off‑target cuts at sites both similar and dissimilar to the targeted DNA site so that we can select for advancement those molecules with no off-target activity in these assays.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Create validated assay panels composed of potential off‑target sites identified by both computational approaches and other unbiased methods. These verification assay panels, or targeted resequencing assay, will then be applied to in vitro and in vivo experimental systems to confirm specificity as we advance to the clinic. Included in these assay panels are genome detection methods that allow detection of multiple editing events in a single reaction. Our proprietary Uni-Directional Targeted Sequencing method (“UDiTaS”) is a simple, efficient way to simultaneously measure small and large editing events at single nucleotide resolution and provide accurate quantification of these events.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  To optimize the specificity of our product candidates, there are a number of different aspects of the product configuration that we customize in addition to the sequence and quality of the guide RNA, including the length of the guide RNA, the type of Cas9 or Cpf1 enzyme, the delivery vector, the use of tissue‑selective promoters, and the duration of exposure all contribute to overall specificity. For example, to reduce the potential persistence of genome editing activity, we are developing self‑regulating genome editing systems designed to deliver not only the endonuclease‑guide RNA complex, but also an “off switch” that reduces the presence of the endonuclease‑guide RNA complex over time. We have completed studies of these systems that demonstrate the ability to both maintain on‑target editing and also reduce levels of editing components once the on‑target edit is expected to have been completed.
 Directed Editing
 There are different mechanisms that a cell can use to repair cuts in DNA. Each mechanism results in different kinds of genetic changes. We are developing approaches to selectively harness specific DNA repair mechanisms to be able to drive the appropriate type of repair for a given disease. The ability to direct the DNA repair mechanism and influence the utilization of a DNA repair template is critical to achieving the broadest potential for our platform. We believe that our ability to understand and direct the repair mechanisms used by cells creates opportunities to improve our existing programs and opens up new opportunities to develop medicines, including medicines that rely on specific template utilization events.

We have achieved significant levels of DNA template directed genetic change in ex vivo edited primary human T cells and hematopoietic stem cells. Using long single stranded DNA template molecules, we have achieved greater than 40% directed editing. Using vial donor templates, we have achieved greater than 70% targeted insertion at specific genomic locations. We believe that these advancements will enable us to create medicines that may be superior to traditional gene therapy.
 Our Genomic Medicine Programs
 We have initiated a diversified range of research programs across multiple therapeutic areas. Our initial product development strategy is to primarily target genetically defined diseases with a focus on debilitating illnesses where there 

 
 
 10

 
are poor or no approved treatments and where the genetic basis of disease is well understood. While our discovery efforts have ranged across several different diseases and therapeutic areas, the two areas where programs are more mature are ocular diseases and engineered cell medicines. We believe the therapeutic programs and delivery technologies we have chosen to date will demonstrate the depth and breadth of our ability to deploy our genome editing platform to treat patients in need with either genetically defined or genetically treatable diseases. A summary of our experimental medicines under development is presented in the following graphic:

 Eye Diseases
 We have granted Allergan an exclusive option to exclusively license from us up to five collaboration development programs for the treatment of ocular disorders, including our LCA10 program, subject to our right to elect to participate in a profit-sharing arrangement with Allergan in the United States with respect to our LCA10 program and up to one other collaboration development program. See “Our Collaboration and Licensing Strategy" below for more information. Leber Congenital Amaurosis 10
 Leber Congenital Amaurosis (“LCA”) is a heterogeneous group of inherited retinal dystrophies caused by mutations in at least 18 different genes and is the most common cause of inherited childhood blindness, with an incidence of two to three per 100,000 live births worldwide. Symptoms of LCA appear within the first year of life with significant vision loss, rapid involuntary movements of the eyes, painful eye response to bright light, and absence of measurable electroretinogram recordings due to a lack of functional photoreceptor cells. The most common form of the disease is LCA10, a monogenic disorder that represents approximately 20-30% of all LCA subtypes. LCA10 is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the CEP290 gene, which encodes a protein required for the survival and proper function of photoreceptor cells. The most frequently found mutation within the CEP290 gene, occurring in approximately 85% of north and west European patients with LCA10, is an A to G nucleotide change that disrupts 

 
 
 11

 
normal splicing, or processing, of the gene message, ultimately resulting in a deficiency of functional CEP290 protein. Decreased CEP290 protein leads to loss of photoreceptor function and cells over time, which leads to blindness.
 We are developing a genome editing therapeutic for LCA10 that uses an AAV5 vector to deliver the DNA encoding Cas9 and two guide RNAs to photoreceptor cells in the eye. Our product candidate is called EDIT-101 and it is designed to eliminate the A to G nucleotide change in a non-coding region, or intron, of the CEP290 gene by cutting out that nucleotide and surrounding DNA. We believe this genome editing approach has the potential to restore normal protein expression and function of the remaining photoreceptor cells, which could arrest or improve the further loss of vision in LCA patients.
 We have tested combinations of Cas9 and guide RNA pairs in vitro in cells that were obtained from patients with the CEP290 mutation to determine whether they could successfully edit the mutation and lead to correctly spliced messenger RNA (“mRNA”) and correctly produced CEP290 protein. We isolated and analyzed DNA from these edited cells and observed removal of the mutation-containing region in the DNA. These studies also demonstrated that the edit restored significant levels of normal mRNA and lowered the levels of mutant mRNA, as compared to controls of untreated patient cells. This restoration of normal mRNA expression suggests that we successfully edited the LCA10 gene defect in these cells.
 In these studies, we also observed two-fold and greater increases in full-length CEP290 protein expression compared to untreated patient cell controls. We believe this demonstrates that successful editing of the genetic defect that causes LCA10 also leads to increased expression of the normal CEP290 protein. It is our view that increased expression of normal CEP290 protein could improve or arrest the further loss of vision in LCA10 patients.
 Certain clinical research studies estimated that retention of 10% of photoreceptors can impart meaningful vision in humans. Based on these studies, we have prespecified a therapeutic target of 10% productive editing of photoreceptors with the assumption that each productively edited photoreceptor will be fully functional.
 To investigate genome editing in vivo, we conducted studies in nonhuman primates using subretinal injection of an AAV5 expressing Cas9 and nonhuman primate specific guide RNAs. After either six or 13 weeks, animals were euthanized and retinal tissue from the injected region was removed for analysis. These studies showed that AAV genomes and Cas9 expression were limited to photoreceptors. In addition, we estimate that 12-22% and 50% of CEP-290 alleles were productively edited at six weeks and at 13 weeks, respectively. In these studies, productive editing is defined as the proportion of photoreceptor cells edited in a manner that we believe will restore CEP290 protein function. All of these values exceed our prespecified therapeutic target of 10% productive editing. 

In addition, we developed a retinal explant system to explore the potential effectiveness EDIT-101 in human tissue. In these studies, retinas from human cadavers were dissected, placed in culture, and exposed to EDIT-101 at a low and a high dose. After 14 days or 28 days in culture, genome editing was analyzed to determine the rate of productive editing in photoreceptors. These studies showed time-dependent and dose-dependent editing that exceeded our therapeutic target at all times and doses tested, including over 50% editing after 28 days at the high dose. 

To characterize editing specificity, we have applied a combination of methods to quantify the frequency of modification at the targeted DNA location and to assess the potential for modification at off-target locations in the genome. For each guide RNA included in the studies above, we measured the potential for off-target activity using multiple analytical techniques, including GUIDE-Seq, Digenome-Seq, our proprietary UDiTaS system, and bi-directional polymerase chain reaction and deep sequencing. With these techniques we have assessed the specificity of each guide RNA in certain cell culture systems and tissue types and we were able to clearly identify several guide RNAs that showed no detectable off-target activity. We believe our detailed characterization of editing specificity allows us to select guide RNA and endonuclease combinations with the highest likelihood of providing clinical benefit in patients while working to minimize potential safety risks.
 Other Eye Diseases
 We are also pursuing the development of therapies for eye diseases other than LCA10, including HSV‑1, infections and USH2A. We believe that our experience with the LCA10 program will support the development of 

 
 
 12

 
therapies for these other eye diseases. For example, the successful construction, packaging, and testing of the components of the AAV vector we are pursuing for LCA10 will continue to inform our approach to treating the most common cause of USH2A.
 Herpes Simplex Virus 1
 HSV‑1 causes lifelong infections mainly leading to ocular and oral disease. Infected individuals develop persistent latent infections, mainly in the nerves in the affected part of the body. During latency, the HSV‑1 DNA does not integrate into the infected individual’s genome, but rather it remains within the individual’s cells as independent viral genomic material. The latent HSV‑1 virus can then be reactivated by illness, emotional or physical stress, and other conditions. Ocular infection with HSV‑1 is a major health problem, especially in developed countries. It is the most common infectious cause of blindness in developed economies with over 25,000 recurrent cases each year. Recurrent activation of HSV-1 virus causes corneal damage and scarring, which impairs the ability to see. Existing therapies have only partial benefit in preventing the initial HSV‑1 infection or recurrences. As a result, there is a need for an effective therapy that prevents or reduces reactivation of latent HSV‑1. Our ongoing research program aims to deliver the CRISPR molecular machinery to the eye and specifically cleave and inactivate latent HSV‑1 DNA with the goal of eliminating or reducing reactivation. Usher Syndrome 2A
 USH2A gene mutations are the most common cause of Usher syndrome, a form of retinitis pigmentosa that also includes hearing loss. Loss of the usherin protein encoded by the USH2A gene leads to a degeneration of the retina and progressive vision loss. More than 200 mutations have been identified for this gene. Our initial goal in this research program is to address mutations within exon 13, which is the location of the highest percentage of USH2A gene mutations. We believe there are approximately 14,000 USH2A patients including up to approximately 4,000 Usher syndrome patients with the mutation we aim to correct.
 We have granted Allergan an exclusive option to exclusively license from us up to five collaboration development programs for the treatment of ocular disorders, including our LCA10 program, subject to our right to elect to participate in a profit-sharing arrangement with Allergan in the United States with respect to our LCA10 program and up to one other collaboration development program. See “Our Collaboration and Licensing Strategy" below for more information.
 Engineered Cell Medicines
 Collaboration with Juno Therapeutics on Engineered T Cells to Treat Cancer
 Engineered T cells have shown encouraging clinical activity against multiple cancers, culminating in the recent approval of two such therapies in the United States. Because of these promising results, there is significant interest in the medical community in expanding the application of this technology across a broader range of cancers and patients. We believe that our genome editing technology has the potential to improve multiple properties of these T cell therapies. If we are successful, genome-edited engineered T cells have the potential to significantly expand the types of cancers treatable by chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”)/engineered T cell receptor (“Engineered TCR”) T cells and to improve the outcomes of these therapies.
    Through our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics, a leader in the emerging field of immuno-oncology, we have applied our genome editing technology to multiple gene targets in order to improve the efficacy and safety of CAR/ Engineered TCR T cells directed against a range of tumor types. In addition, we are currently optimizing genome editing components and delivery methods compatible with engineered T cell manufacturing methods developed by Juno Therapeutics. We have achieved success in a number of areas within our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics and have received two milestone payments to date, totaling $5.0 million. 

One important challenge in the field of T cell therapies for cancer has been to use Engineered TCRs to direct the elimination of cancers based on the presence of intracellular cancer antigens. Engineered TCRs differ from CARs in that they recognize small peptides that are generally derived from proteins that reside inside the cell. These intracellular

proteins are important potential targets for cancer immunotherapy. With Juno Therapeutics, we have demonstrated in preclinical studies that disruption of the natural T cell receptor combined with the introduction of an Engineered TCR resulted in significantly improved in vitro T cell function. Furthermore, the elimination of the natural T cell receptor (“TCR”) has the potential to make a safer medicine as the Engineered TCR will not be able to interact with the natural TCR to create new, and potentially unwanted, functionality. We believe this innovation may broaden the therapeutic opportunity for engineered T cells. 

Non‑malignant Hematologic Diseases

We are developing approaches for genome editing in HSCs to support the advancement of research programs to treat non-malignant hematological diseases. For example, we are actively pursuing multiple gene editing approaches to treating hemoglobinopathies and assessing other opportunities to develop medicines for diseases where we believe gene editing of HSCs is likely to produce a therapeutic effect. 
 We have taken two distinct genome editing approaches at the hemoglobin locus with the aim of developing best-in-class medicines for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. Our first approach is focused on editing a novel site within the hemoglobin locus that we believe has the potential to create superior expression of fetal hemoglobin. Based on the observation that patients with elevated fetal hemoglobin levels have better clinical outcomes, we believe this approach could significantly benefit people with sickle cell disease. Our second genome editing approach uses CRISPR editing and targeted insertion to restore natural hemoglobin expression and eliminate the sickle cell mutation. Using this approach, we have shown in studies that we can achieve greater than 30% targeted insertion at the beta globin gene locus, the gene locus that contains the sickle cell mutation, in CD34+ human stem cells, and we believe that this may restore hemoglobin expression and eliminate the sickle cell mutation. 
 Early Discovery Programs
 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
 Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”) is a genetic disorder primarily affecting boys and is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy that presents in early childhood and rapidly results in loss of ambulation and respiratory muscle function. Additionally, DMD often causes cardiomyopathy in adolescence. Death occurs typically in early adulthood. The incidence of DMD is approximately one in every 3,500 male births with a prevalence of approximately 15,000 cases in the United States. The United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has approved only two therapies for the treatment of DMD. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes dystrophin, a structural protein that is important for normal muscle health. Loss of dystrophin function leads to muscle degeneration. We believe that restoring dystrophin activity before the onset of severe loss of muscle function could significantly and favorably alter disease progression.
 The dystrophin gene is one of the largest in the human genome spanning 2.2 million base pairs. Pathogenic mutations can occur throughout the gene. Many disease‑causing mutations in the dystrophin gene consist of deletions that lead to non‑functional protein. Interestingly, large deletions in the middle of the dystrophin protein have been identified that cause only mild to moderate disease. For example, deletions of selected exons have been shown to cause the much less severe Becker muscular dystrophy. Our genome editing approach is to introduce targeted deletions of mutation‑containing segments of the gene in order to create smaller, yet functional versions of the dystrophin gene. Based on the known spectrum of DMD‑causing mutations, an NHEJ‑mediated small deletion of exon 51 would be expected to address approximately 13% of patients whereas an NHEJ‑mediated large deletion encompassing exons 45 through 55 would expand coverage to up to 60% of patients.
 Cystic Fibrosis
 Cystic fibrosis (“CF”) is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disease in the Caucasian population. The overall birth prevalence of CF in the United States is approximately one in 3,700. The gene that causes CF encodes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (“CFTR”), which helps maintain the water balance within the lung. Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to an imbalance of ion and water movement, leading to accumulation of mucus, chronic bacterial infection and inflammation of the airway epithelium. Correcting the CF mutations in lung epithelial 

 
 
 14

 
cells will require efficient editing of these cells and development of advanced pulmonary delivery modalities. We aim to establish multiple collaborations with academics, foundations, and other companies developing novel lung delivery approaches to achieve these goals. To that end, in May 2016 we entered into an award agreement with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc. (“CFFT”) pursuant to which CFFT has agreed to pay us up to $5.0 million over the agreement’s three year term to support our CF development program and related technology research and development. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to contribute additional funds to the program in an amount equal to the funds contributed by CFFT and to pay certain amounts to CFFT upon the achievement of specified events.
 Alpha‑1 Antitrypsin Deficiency
 Alpha‑1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disease caused by production of an abnormal alpha‑1 antitrypsin (“A1AT”) protein, leading to lung and liver disease. A1AT is one of the primary proteins made in the liver and its normal activity protects the lungs from pro‑inflammatory enzymes. This disease affects about one in 1,500 to 3,500 individuals of European ancestry. Mutations in A1AT lead to accumulation of A1AT aggregates in the liver and may cause cirrhosis. In addition, loss of A1AT activity in the lung may result in emphysema. The current standards of care are weekly intravenous infusions of functional A1AT protein obtained from human donor plasma, and lung or liver transplant for severe cases. Our genome editing approach starts with deleting, through NHEJ, the gene in the liver to prevent liver disease, followed by gene correction in the liver to address both liver and lung disease. Our Collaborations and Licensing Strategy
 Juno Therapeutics Collaboration and License Agreement
 In May 2015, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Juno Therapeutics for the research and development of engineered T cells with CARs and TCRs that have been genetically modified to recognize and kill other cells. In particular, Juno Therapeutics and we will research and develop CAR and TCR engineered T cell products across three research programs over a five‑year period, ending on May 26, 2020. Juno Therapeutics has the option to extend the research period through May 26, 2022, upon payment of one‑year extension fees in the mid‑single‑digit millions of dollars per year. We refer to the five‑ to seven‑year period as the research program term of the collaboration.
 During the research program term, we are responsible for generating genome editing reagents that modify gene targets selected by Juno Therapeutics. Juno Therapeutics is responsible for evaluating and selecting for further research and development CAR and TCR engineered T cell products modified with our genome editing reagents. Except for our obligations under the mutually agreed research plan, Juno Therapeutics has sole responsibility, at its own cost, for the worldwide development, manufacturing, and commercialization of the selected CAR and TCR engineered T cell products for the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of any cancer in humans, excluding the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of medullary cystic kidney disease 1 (the “Exclusive Field”).
 Under the collaboration agreement, we granted to Juno Therapeutics an exclusive (even as to us), worldwide, milestone and royalty‑bearing, sublicensable license to certain of our owned and in‑licensed patent rights to research, develop, make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell and import selected CAR and TCR engineered T cell products in the Exclusive Field. In addition, we granted to Juno Therapeutics a non‑exclusive, worldwide, milestone and royalty‑bearing, sublicensable license to certain of our owned and in‑licensed patent rights to use genome editing reagents that are used in the creation of a CAR or TCR engineered T cell product on which Juno Therapeutics has filed an IND for the treatment or prevention of a cancer in humans for researching, developing, making, having made, using, offering for sale, selling, and importing that CAR or TCR engineered T cell product in all fields outside of the Exclusive Field, excluding the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of medullary cystic kidney disease 1. We further granted to Juno Therapeutics a non‑exclusive, worldwide, non‑sublicensable license to certain of our owned and in‑licensed patent rights to, among other things, conduct the activities assigned to Juno Therapeutics under the mutually agreed research plan and to our genome editing reagents for further research and development of CAR and TCR engineered T cell products. Juno Therapeutics granted to us a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free, and non‑sublicensable license to certain Juno Therapeutics patents solely for the purpose of our conducting the research activities assigned to us under the mutually agreed research plan.

 During the research program term and except pursuant to the collaboration agreement, we may not conduct or participate in, and may not license, fund or otherwise enable a third party to conduct or participate in, research, development, manufacture, or commercialization of CAR and TCR engineered T cells in the Exclusive Field. In addition, we may not enter into any collaboration, license, or other relationship with a third party to use our genome editing technology with respect to CAR and TCR engineered T cells in any other field, excluding the diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of medullary cystic kidney disease 1, unless we first provide written notice to Juno Therapeutics and provide Juno Therapeutics an opportunity to discuss a comparable collaboration, license, or other relationship. Juno Therapeutics has agreed to certain exclusivity obligations with us with respect to certain gene editing technologies.
 During the term of the collaboration agreement and except pursuant to the collaboration agreement, we may not conduct or participate in, and may not license, fund, or otherwise enable a third party to conduct or participate in, research, development, manufacturing, or commercialization activities involving the use of our genome editing technology, or any genome editing technology similar to ours, with respect to the gene targets selected by Juno Therapeutics during the research program term for further research and development in the Exclusive Field. During the term of the collaboration agreement and except pursuant to the collaboration agreement, we may not conduct or participate in, and may not license, fund, or otherwise enable a third party to conduct or participate in, research, development, manufacturing, or commercialization activities with respect to a certain type of CAR or TCR engineered T cell product for use in the Exclusive Field, where such product targets a protein designated by Juno Therapeutics during the research program term as a target for Juno Therapeutics’ further research and development of that certain type of CAR or TCR engineered T cell product.
 Juno Therapeutics and we each must use diligent efforts to perform all activities for which Juno Therapeutics or we are responsible under the collaboration. Juno Therapeutics also is required to achieve certain regulatory objectives with respect to the engineered T cells in each of the three programs by specified dates. Under the agreement, if Juno Therapeutics does not meet its initial regulatory objective by the required date with respect to an engineered T cell in a specified program, then we can, as our exclusive remedy to Juno Therapeutics’ failure, convert the exclusive license we granted to Juno Therapeutics to a non‑exclusive license to Juno Therapeutics with respect to the particular program to which Juno Therapeutics’ failure relates. If Juno Therapeutics does not meet a subsequent regulatory objective with respect to an engineered T cell within a program, then we can, as our exclusive remedy to Juno Therapeutics’ failure, convert the exclusive license we granted to Juno Therapeutics to a non‑exclusive license to Juno Therapeutics with respect to the particular engineered T cell to which Juno Therapeutics’ failure relates.
 The collaboration is supervised by a joint research committee (“JRC”) comprising an equal number of representatives from each of Juno Therapeutics and us. The JRC oversees and coordinates research activities during the research program term. Moreover, each party will appoint a project leader and the project leaders will be responsible for, among other things, coordinating the day‑to‑day work and raising cross‑party disputes in a timely manner. Decisions of the JRC are made by unanimous vote, with each of Juno Therapeutics and us having one vote. If the JRC is not able to reach a unanimous decision, Juno Therapeutics’ and our respective chief executive officers will attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith. If the chief executive officers cannot resolve the dispute, subject to certain requirements, Juno Therapeutics has the final decision making authority with respect to disputes relating to the development of the licensed products within the research plan, and we have the final decision making authority with respect to disputes relating to our patents, know‑how and technology.
 Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we received an upfront payment of $25.0 million from Juno Therapeutics and we have received two milestone payments totaling $5.0 million under the collaboration for technical progress in two research programs. In addition, we have the potential to receive up to $22.0 million in research support over a five year term across the three programs under our collaboration, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the agreement, of which we had recognized $12.2 million as of December 31, 2017, inclusive of the $5.0 million in milestone payments. We are eligible to receive future research and regulatory milestones of approximately $160.0 million for each of the first products developed in each of the three research programs, of which we have achieved two milestone payments of $2.5 million each. We also are eligible to receive future commercial sales milestones of $75.0 million based on certain specified thresholds of aggregate, worldwide net sales of all engineered T cell products within each of the three research programs. Further, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties of low double‑digit percentages of Juno Therapeutics’ net sales of products licensed under our collaboration agreement. Juno Therapeutics’ obligation to pay royalties on a licensed product will expire on a product‑by‑product and 

 
 
 16

 
country‑by‑country basis upon the later of the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product and the expiration of the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents covering such licensed product. If Juno Therapeutics is required to pay royalties on net sales of a licensed product to a third party because the licensed product is covered under the third party’s patent, then Juno Therapeutics can credit a certain percentage of its payments to the third party against the royalties it owes us, subject to certain maximum deduction limits.
 We will own any inventions developed by our employees and agents during our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics. Juno Therapeutics and we will jointly own any inventions made jointly by employees or agents of Juno Therapeutics and us during our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics. We retain control, at our own cost, of the prosecution and maintenance of our solely owned patents. Juno Therapeutics and we will be jointly responsible for the prosecution and maintenance of any jointly owned patents. We hold the final decision making authority with respect to claims of jointly owned patents relating to our genome editing technology and Juno Therapeutics holds the final decision making authority with respect to claims of jointly owned patents relating to CAR and TCR engineered T cell products.
 Unless terminated earlier, the term of the collaboration agreement will expire on a product‑by‑product and country‑by‑country basis until the date no further payments are due to us from Juno Therapeutics. Juno Therapeutics may terminate the agreement for convenience in its entirety upon six months’ written notice to us. Either Juno Therapeutics or we may terminate the agreement if the other party is in material breach and fails to cure such breach within the specified cure period. Either Juno Therapeutics or we may terminate the agreement in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party.
 If Juno Therapeutics terminates the agreement as a result of our uncured material breach, Juno Therapeutics’ rights and licenses to our specified patent rights, Juno Therapeutics’ obligations to pay us certain research milestones and royalties, and Juno Therapeutics’ rights to prosecute, maintain, and enforce certain patent rights each continue as set forth under the agreement. If Juno Therapeutics terminates the agreement for convenience or we terminate the agreement as a result of Juno Therapeutics’ uncured material breach, the licenses we granted to Juno Therapeutics will terminate. 
 As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Juno Therapeutics has been acquired by Celgene Corporation. We do not anticipate that this acquisition will have a significant impact on our collaboration with Juno Therapeutics.
 Allergan Strategic Alliance and Option Agreement 
 In March 2017, we entered into a strategic alliance and option agreement with Allergan to discover, develop, and commercialize new gene editing medicines for a range of ocular disorders. Over a seven-year research term, Allergan will have an exclusive option to exclusively license from us up to five collaboration development programs for the treatment of ocular disorders (each, a “Collaboration Development Program”), including our LCA10 Program. We will use commercially reasonably efforts to develop at least five Collaboration Development Programs and deliver preclinical results and data meeting specified criteria with respect to each Collaboration Development Program (each, an “Option Package”) to Allergan. We will generally have responsibility for the conduct of each Collaboration Development Program and sole responsibility for all development costs of each Collaboration Development Program prior to any exercise by Allergan of its option to acquire an exclusive license to such Collaboration Development Program under the terms of the agreement. If at the end of the seven-year research term we have not delivered five Collaboration Development Programs that satisfy the Option Package criteria for each such program, the research term shall automatically extend by one-year increments until such obligation is satisfied, up to three additional years (the “Research Term”). In connection with entering into this agreement, Allergan paid us a one-time up-front payment of $90.0 million. In addition, within 45 days of the acceptance by the applicable regulatory authority of our submission of an investigational new drug application with respect to the LCA10 Program, Allergan is required to pay us a one-time payment of $25.0 million, whether or not Allergan exercises its option under the agreement to acquire an exclusive license with respect to the LCA10 Program.
 Upon delivery of an Option Package with respect to a Collaboration Development Program to Allergan, Allergan is entitled, for specified periods of time thereafter (each, an “Initial Option Period”), to exercise an option (an “Option”) to acquire from us an exclusive (even as to us and our affiliates) world-wide right and license to our background intellectual property and our interest in the Collaboration Development Program intellectual property to 

 
 
 17

 
develop, commercialize, make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, and import any gene editing therapy product that results from such Collaboration Development Program during the term of the agreement (a “Licensed Product”) in any category of human diseases and conditions other than the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of any cancer in humans through the use of engineered T-cells and subject to specified other limitations. Following the exercise of an Option, Allergan will have the right to grant sublicenses subject to specified terms, under Allergan’s exclusive license to our background intellectual property and our interest in the Collaboration Development Program intellectual property, to develop, commercialize, make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, and import Licensed Products. 
 Upon the exercise of an Option within the Initial Option Period, Allergan is required to pay to us an option exercise fee of $15.0 million. At any time during the Initial Option Period, Allergan may also elect to extend the period of time in which it may exercise the Option to permit additional development work with respect to the Collaboration Development Program, and in connection with such extension Allergan will be required to pay us an option extension fee of $5.0 million. If, following such an extension, Allergan exercises the Option following the Initial Option Period, Allergan will be required to pay us a higher option exercise fee of $22.5 million plus specified costs incurred by us in connection with the additional development work. If Allergan does not exercise an Option within a specified option exercise period and any extension thereof, such Option will terminate.
 In addition, subject to specified limitations, at the end of the Research Term, Allergan will have the right, for a specified period of time, to exercise an Option with respect to each Collaboration Development Program for which we have not yet delivered an Option Package. Upon the exercise by Allergan of any such option, Allergan is required to pay to us an option exercise fee in the low-seven digits. 
 Following the exercise by Allergan of an Option with respect to a Collaboration Development Program, Allergan will be responsible for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of any Licensed Products thereunder and will be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize at least one Licensed Product thereunder. If Allergan exercises its Option for the LCA10 Program, subject to Allergan’s financial responsibility and final decision-making authority with respect to any development activities following such exercise, we will remain primarily responsible for conducting the LCA10 Program through the acceptance for filing of the first IND application with respect to the LCA10 Program.
 We are entitled to receive clinical, regulatory, and launch milestone payments from Allergan up to a low-nine-digit amount in the aggregate and further commercial milestone payments up to a high-eight-digit amount in the aggregate with respect to each Collaboration Development Program for which Allergan exercises its Option, with certain of such milestone payments subject to reduction under certain circumstances. In the aggregate, we are eligible to receive clinical, regulatory, launch, and commercial milestone payments that could exceed $200.0 million for an indication in the first field per Collaboration Development Program, as well as the potential for additional regulatory milestones for indications in up to two additional fields. We are also entitled to receive royalties in the high-single digit percentages with respect to net sales of Licensed Products, subject to certain reductions under specified circumstances, and we will remain obligated to pay all license fees, milestone payments, and royalties due to its upstream licensors based on Allergan’s exercise of its license rights with respect to Licensed Products. Allergan’s obligation to pay royalties will expire on a country-by-country/Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis upon the latest of the expiration of patent-based exclusivity with respect to the applicable Licensed Product in the applicable country, expiration of regulatory-based exclusivity with respect to the applicable Licensed Product in the applicable country and the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale by Allergan of the applicable Licensed Product in the applicable country. We are generally required to pay to Allergan royalties in the low- to mid-single digit percentages on net sales of products developed under Collaboration Development Programs that Allergan terminated following exercise of its Option, in each case over royalty terms equivalent to those for the royalties due to us under the agreement.
 With respect to the LCA10 Program and up to one other Collaboration Development Program of our choosing, following the exercise by Allergan of its Option to such programs, we will have the right to elect to participate in a profit-sharing arrangement with Allergan in the United States, on terms mutually agreed by us and Allergan and subject to a right of Allergan to reject such election under certain circumstances, under which we and Allergan would share equally in net profits and losses on specific terms to be agreed between us and Allergan, in lieu of Allergan paying royalties on net sales of any applicable Licensed Products in the United States and in such event Allergan’s milestone payment obligations would be reduced, with our being eligible to receive clinical, regulatory, and launch milestone 

 
 
 18

 
payments up to a low nine-digit amount in the aggregate and further commercial milestone payments up to a high-eight digit amount in the aggregate, subject to reduction under certain circumstances. If we elect to participate in a profit-sharing arrangement, we are obligated to reimburse Allergan for half of the development costs incurred by Allergan with respect to the applicable Collaboration Development Program and Allergan will retain control of all development and commercialization activities for the applicable Licensed Products. Under the agreement, we and Allergan will establish an alliance steering committee (“ASC”) comprised of three members from each of us and Allergan, which will have review, oversight and decision-making responsibility for selecting the targets and indications and certain Option Package criteria for the Collaboration Development Programs and determining whether the Option Package criteria for a Collaboration Development Program have been satisfied. With respect to a given Collaboration Development Program, all decisions of the ASC will be made by consensus, subject to specified final decision-making rights, with each of us and Allergan having one vote.
 During the Research Term, neither we nor any of our affiliates will, subject to specified exceptions in the agreement, develop, manufacture or commercialize any gene editing therapy in the ocular field, or grant a license or sublicense to develop, manufacture or commercialize any gene editing therapy in the ocular field. During the Research Term, neither Allergan nor any of its affiliates will, subject to specified exceptions in the agreement, develop, manufacture or commercialize, or grant a license or sublicense to develop, manufacture or commercialize, any gene editing therapy in the ocular field directed to any ocular indication to which any gene editing therapy in any non-terminated Collaboration Development Program is directed or the same target to which any gene editing therapy in any non-terminated Collaboration Development Program is directed. After the Research Term, neither we, Allergan nor any of their respective affiliates will, subject to specified exceptions in the agreement, develop, manufacture or commercialize, or grant a license or sublicense to develop, manufacture or commercialize, any gene editing therapy in the ocular field directed to any ocular indication to which any Licensed Product is directed or any target to which any Licensed Product is directed. 
 Unless earlier terminated, the term of the agreement will expire upon (i) the expiration of the Research Term if Allergan does not exercise any Option or (ii) the expiration of all payment obligations under the agreement. In addition to other termination rights, Allergan has the right to terminate the agreement (i) in its entirety for an uncured material breach by us and (ii) in its entirety for any reason on a program-by-program basis for the Collaboration Development Programs for which Allergan has exercised its Option with 90 days’ written notice. Additionally, Allergan may terminate the Research Term (a) on a Collaboration Development Program-by-Collaboration Development Program basis upon written notice to us in the event of a change of control of us or (b) for all Collaboration Development Programs, provided that, Allergan will not have any right to exercise any Option for any such Collaboration Development Program following any such termination. If Allergan terminates the Agreement for our material breach, subject to Allergan’s continued payment, reporting, and audit obligations under the agreement, Allergan has the right to retain all licenses granted under the agreement and Allergan will no longer have any diligence obligations with respect to the Licensed Products.
 Intellectual Property Licenses
 We are a party to a number of license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property from third parties. The licensed intellectual property covers, in part, CRISPR and transcription activator‑like effector (“TALE”)‑related compositions of matter and their use for genome editing. These licenses impose various diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future. We consider the following license agreements to be material to our business. The Broad Institute and President and Fellows of Harvard College License Agreement
 In October 2014, we entered into a license agreement with The Broad Institute, Inc. (“Broad”) and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (“Harvard”), for specified patent rights. In December 2016, we amended and restated this license agreement and further amended the agreement in March 2017 (the “Cas9‑I License Agreement”). Among other things, the Cas9‑I License Agreement amended the original license agreement by excluding additional fields from the scope of the exclusive license granted to us; converting the exclusive license to three specified targets to a non‑exclusive license, subject to specified limitations; revising certain provisions relating to the rights of Harvard and Broad to grant further licenses under specified circumstances to third parties that wish to develop and commercialize 

 
 
 19

 
products that target a particular gene and that otherwise would fall within the scope of our exclusive license; and providing Harvard and Broad with certain rights to designate, and reserve all rights to, gene targets for which the designating institution has an interest in researching and developing products that would otherwise be covered by rights licensed to us. The licenses granted to us under the Cas9‑I License Agreement include rights to certain patents solely owned by Harvard (the “Harvard Cas9‑I Patent Rights”), certain patents co‑owned by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”) and Broad, certain patents co-owned by MIT, The Rockefeller University (“Rockefeller”), and Broad, and certain patents co‑owned by MIT, Broad and Harvard. We refer to all the patents and patent applications licensed to us under the Cas9‑I License Agreement as the Harvard/Broad Cas9‑I Patent Rights.
 Certain patent applications in the Harvard/Broad Cas9-I Patent Rights are jointly owned by Rockefeller. In February 2017, Broad and Rockefeller entered into an inter-institutional agreement pursuant to which Rockefeller authorized Broad to act as its sole and exclusive agent for the purposes of licensing Rockefeller’s rights in such Harvard/Broad Cas9-I Patent Rights and any additional related patents or patent applications that Rockefeller may jointly own with Broad. The March 2017 amendment to the Cas9-I License Agreement included a license to Rockefeller’s rights in such patents and patent applications.
 The Harvard/Broad Cas9‑I Patent Rights are directed, in part, to certain CRISPR/Cas9 and TALE‑related compositions of matter and their use for genome editing and to certain CRISPR/Cas9 and TALE‑related delivery technologies. Pursuant to the Cas9‑I License Agreement, and as of December 31, 2017, we have certain rights under 37 U.S. patents, 64 pending U.S. patent applications, 11 European patents and related validations, 38 pending European patent applications, and other related patent applications in jurisdictions outside of the United States and Europe.
 Pursuant to the Cas9‑I License Agreement, Harvard and Broad granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑bearing, sublicensable license to the Harvard/Broad Cas9‑I Patent Rights to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, have sold, import, and export products and services in the field of the prevention and treatment of human disease, subject to certain limitations and retained rights. The exclusive license granted by Broad and Harvard excludes certain fields, including the modification of animals or animal cells for the creation and sale of organs suitable for xenotransplantation into humans; the research, development and commercialization of products or services in the field of livestock applications; plant‑based agricultural products; and, subject to certain limitations, products providing nutritional benefits. Moreover, the license granted by Broad is non‑exclusive with respect to the treatment of medullary cystic kidney disease 1 and three other specified targets, subject to the limitation that for such three targets, each of Broad and Harvard is only permitted to grant a non‑exclusive license to one third party at a time with respect to each such target within the field of exclusive license granted to us. Harvard and Broad also granted us a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑bearing, sublicensable license to the Harvard/Broad Cas9‑I Patent Rights for all purposes, with the exception that the non‑exclusive license to certain Harvard Cas9‑I Patent Rights excludes the modification of animals or animal cells for the creation and sale of organs suitable for xenotransplantation into humans and the development and commercialization of products or services in the field of livestock applications. In addition to the exclusions described above, the following are excluded from the scope of both the exclusive and non‑exclusive licenses granted to us under the Cas9‑I License Agreement: human germline modification; the stimulation of biased inheritance of particular genes or traits within a population of plants or animals; the research, development, manufacturing, or commercialization of sterile seeds; and the modification of the tobacco plant with specified exceptions.
 We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, and commercialize products for the prevention or treatment of human disease under the Cas9‑I License Agreement. Also, we are required to achieve certain development milestones within specified time periods for products incorporating the CRISPR/Cas9, TAL, and delivery‑related technologies covered by the Harvard/Broad Cas9‑I Patent Rights. Harvard and Broad have the right to terminate our license with respect to the Harvard/Broad Cas9‑I Patent Rights covering the technology or technologies with respect to which we fail to achieve these development milestones.
 The licenses granted by Broad and Harvard to us under the Cas9‑I License Agreement are subject to retained rights of the U.S. government in the Harvard/Broad Cas9‑I Patent Rights and the rights retained by Broad, Harvard, MIT, and Rockefeller on behalf of themselves and other academic, government and non‑profit entities, to practice the Harvard/Broad Cas9‑I Patent Rights for research, educational, or teaching purposes. In addition, certain rights granted to us under the Cas9‑I License Agreement are further subject to a non‑exclusive license to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for research purposes. Our exclusive license rights also are subject to rights retained by Broad, Harvard, MIT, 

 
 
 20

 
and Rockefeller any third party to research, develop, make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, have sold, import or otherwise exploit the Harvard/Broad Cas9‑I Patent Rights and licensed products as research products or research tools, or for research purposes.
 We have the right to sublicense our licensed rights provided that the sublicense agreement must be in compliance and consistent with the terms of the Cas9‑I License Agreement. Any sublicense agreement cannot include the right to grant further sublicenses without the written consent of Broad and Harvard. In addition, any sublicense agreements must contain certain terms, including a provision requiring the sublicensee to indemnify Harvard, Broad, MIT, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute according to the same terms as are provided in the Cas9‑I License Agreement and a statement that Broad, Harvard, MIT, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute are intended third party beneficiaries of the sublicense agreement for certain purposes.
 Under the agreement, Harvard and Broad also retained rights to grant further licenses under specified circumstances to third parties, other than specified entities, that wish to develop and commercialize products that target a particular gene and that otherwise would fall within the scope of our exclusive license from Harvard and Broad. If a third party requests a license under the Harvard/Broad Cas9‑I Patent Rights for the development and commercialization of a product that would be subject to our exclusive license grant from Harvard and Broad under the Cas9‑I License Agreement, Harvard and Broad may notify us of the request (the “Cas9‑I Third Party Proposed Product Requests”). A Cas9‑I Third Party Proposed Product Request must be accompanied by a research, development and commercialization plan reasonably satisfactory to Harvard and Broad, including evidence that the third party has, or reasonably expects to have, access to any necessary intellectual property and funding. Harvard and Broad may not grant a Cas9‑I Third Party Proposed Product Request (i) if we, directly or through any of our affiliates, sublicensees, or collaborators are researching, developing, or commercializing a product directed to the same gene target that is the subject of the Cas9‑I Third Party Proposed Product Request (“Cas9‑I Licensee Product”) and we can demonstrate such ongoing efforts to Harvard’s and Broad’s reasonable satisfaction, or (ii) if we, directly or through any of our affiliates or sublicensees, wish to do so either alone or with a collaboration partner, and we can demonstrate to Harvard and Broad’s reasonable satisfaction that we are interested in researching, developing, and commercializing the Cas9‑I Licensee Product, that we have a commercially reasonable research, development, and commercialization plan to do so, and we commence and continue reasonable commercial efforts under such plan. If we, directly or through any of our affiliates, sublicensees, or collaborators, are not researching, developing, or commercializing a Cas9‑I Licensee Product nor able to develop and implement a plan reasonably satisfactory to Harvard and Broad, Harvard and Broad may grant an exclusive or non‑exclusive license to the third party on a gene target‑by‑gene target basis. Beginning in December 2018, our process to address Cas9‑I Third Party Proposed Product Requests will conform to the process established in our Cpf1 license agreement described below.
 The Cas9‑I License Agreement also provides Broad with the right, after a specified period of time and subject to certain limitations, to designate gene targets for which Broad, whether alone or together with an affiliate or third party, has an interest in researching and developing products that would otherwise be covered by rights licensed to us under the Cas9‑I License Agreement. Broad may not so designate any gene target for which we, directly or through any of our affiliates, sublicensees, or collaborators, are researching, developing, or commercializing a product, or for which we can demonstrate to Broad’s reasonable satisfaction that we are interested in researching, developing, and commercializing a product, that we have a commercially reasonable research, development, and commercialization plan to do so, and we commence and continue reasonable commercial efforts under such plan. If we directly or through any of our affiliates, sublicensees, or collaborators, are not researching, developing, or commercializing a product directed toward the gene target designated by Broad and are not able to develop and implement a plan reasonably satisfactory to Broad, Broad is entitled to reserve all rights under the Cas9‑I License Agreement, including the right to grant exclusive or non‑exclusive licenses to third parties, to develop and commercialize products directed to such gene target and our license granted with respect to such gene target will terminate, and we will not be entitled under the Cas9‑I License Agreement to develop and commercialize products directed to that gene target.
 Under the Cas9‑I License Agreement, we paid Broad and Harvard an upfront license fee in the low six figures and issued a single‑digit percentage of shares of our common stock to Broad (with Broad holding a right to request re‑issuance to its designees, including MIT or MIT’s designee) and Harvard. We also must pay an annual license maintenance fee ranging from the low‑ to mid‑five figures to the low‑six figures, depending on the calendar year. This annual license maintenance fee is creditable against royalties owed on licensed products and services in the same year as 

 
 
 21

 
the maintenance fee is paid. We are obligated to reimburse Broad and Harvard for expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the Harvard/Broad Cas9‑I Patent Rights, including expenses associated with any interference proceedings in the USPTO, any opposition proceedings in the EPO, or any other inter partes or other post grant proceedings in these or other jurisdictions where we are seeking patent protection. Therefore, we are obligated to reimburse Broad and/or Harvard for expenses associated with the interference and opposition proceedings involving patents licensed to us under this agreement (described in more detail under “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
 Broad and Harvard are collectively entitled to receive clinical and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $14.8 million in the aggregate per licensed product approved in the United States, the European Union and Japan for the prevention or treatment of a human disease that afflicts at least a specified number of patients in the aggregate in the United States. If we undergo a change of control during the term of the Cas9‑I License Agreement, these clinical and regulatory milestone payments will be increased by a certain percentage in the mid double‑digits. We are also obligated to make additional payments to Broad and Harvard, collectively, of up to an aggregate of $54.0 million upon the occurrence of certain sales milestones per licensed product for the prevention or treatment of a human disease that afflicts at least a specified number of patients in the aggregate in the United States. Broad and Harvard are collectively entitled to receive clinical and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $4.1 million in the aggregate per licensed product approved in the United States and at least one jurisdiction outside the United States for the prevention or treatment of a human disease that afflicts fewer than a specified number of patients in the aggregate in the United States or a specified number of patients per year in the United States, which we refer to as an ultra‑orphan disease. We are also obligated to make additional payments to Broad and Harvard, collectively, of up to an aggregate of $36.0 million upon the occurrence of certain sales milestones per licensed product for the prevention or treatment of an ultra‑orphan disease.
 Broad and Harvard, collectively, are entitled to receive mid single‑digit percentage royalties on net sales of licensed products for the prevention or treatment of human disease, and ranging from low single‑digit to high single‑digit percentage royalties on net sales of other licensed products and services, made by us, our affiliates, or our sublicensees. The royalty percentage depends on the licensed product and licensed service, and whether such licensed product or licensed service is covered by a valid claim within the Harvard/Broad Cas9‑I Patent Rights. If we are legally required to pay royalties to a third party on net sales of our licensed products because such third party holds patent rights that cover such licensed product, then we can credit up to a mid double‑digit percentage of the amount paid to such third party against the royalties due to Harvard and Broad in the same period. Our obligation to pay royalties will expire on a product‑by‑product and country‑by‑country basis upon the later of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the Harvard/Broad Cas9‑I Patent Rights that cover the composition, manufacture, or use of each covered product or service in each country or the tenth anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the licensed product or licensed service. If we sublicense any of the Harvard/Broad Cas9‑I Patent Rights to a third party pursuant to our exclusive license under the Cas9‑I License Agreement, Broad and Harvard, collectively, have the right to receive a low double‑digit percentage of the sublicense income, which percentage decreases to a high single‑digit percentage for licensed products for the prevention or treatment of human disease under sublicenses executed after we meet certain clinical milestones.
 Broad and Harvard retain control of the prosecution of their respective patent rights. If an interference is declared or a derivation proceeding is initiated, with respect to any Harvard/Broad Cas9‑I Patent Rights, then our prosecution related rights, including our right to receive correspondence from a patent office, will be suspended with respect to the patent rights involved in the interference or derivation proceeding until, under some circumstances, we enter into a common interest agreement with that institution. Nevertheless, we remain responsible for the cost of such interference or derivation proceeding. An interference was filed with respect to 12 U.S. patents and one U.S. patent application that are co-owned by Broad and MIT, and in some cases, Harvard, in-licensed by us under the Cas9-I License Agreement. For more information regarding this interference proceeding, see Intellectual Property below, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” in Part I, Item 1A, and “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3. We are responsible for the cost of the interference proceeding and appeal with respect to these patents and this patent application. Broad and Harvard are required to maintain any application or patent within the Harvard/Broad Patents Rights so long as we meet our obligation to reimburse Broad and Harvard for expenses related to prosecution and there is a good faith basis for doing so. If we cease payment for the prosecution of any Harvard/Broad Patent Right, then any license granted to us with respect to such Harvard/Broad Patent Right will terminate.

 
 
 22

 

 We have the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce the Harvard/Broad Cas9‑I Patent Rights with respect to our licensed products so long as certain conditions are met, such as providing Broad and Harvard with evidence demonstrating a good faith basis for bringing suit against a third party. We are solely responsible for the costs of any lawsuits we elect to initiate and cannot enter into a settlement without the prior written consent of Broad and Harvard (and MIT and Rockefeller, if applicable). Any sums recovered in such lawsuits will be shared between us, Broad, and Harvard.
 Unless terminated earlier, the term of the Cas9‑I License Agreement will expire on a country‑by‑country basis, upon the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the Harvard/Broad Cas9‑I Patent Rights in such country. However, our royalty obligations, discussed above, may survive expiration or termination. We have the right to terminate the agreement at will upon four months’ written notice to Broad and Harvard. Broad and Harvard may terminate the agreement upon a specified period of notice in the event of our uncured material breach, such notice period varying depending on the nature of the breach. Both Broad and Harvard may terminate the Cas9‑I License Agreement immediately if we challenge the enforceability, validity, or scope of any Harvard/Broad Patent Right or assist a third party to do so, or in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency. Neither Broad nor Harvard acting alone has the right to terminate the Cas9‑I License Agreement. However, Broad and Harvard may separately terminate the licenses granted to us with respect to their respective patent rights upon the occurrence of the same events that would give rise to the right of both institutions acting collectively to terminate the Cas9‑I License Agreement.
 The Broad Institute—Cpf1 License Agreement
 In December 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Broad, for specified patent rights (“Cpf1 Patent Rights”) related primarily to Cpf1 compositions of matter and their use for gene editing (the “Cpf1 License Agreement”). Pursuant to the Cpf1 License Agreement, Broad, on behalf of itself, Harvard, MIT, Wageningen University (“Wageningen”), and the University of Tokyo (“Tokyo” and collectively with the other institutions, the “Cpf1 Institutions”) granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑bearing, sublicensable license to the Cpf1 Patent Rights, to make, have made, use, have used, sell, offer for sale, have sold, export and import products solely in the field of the prevention or treatment of human disease using gene therapy, editing of genetic material, or targeting of genetic material, subject to certain limitations and retained rights (collectively, the “Exclusive Cpf1 Field”), as well as a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑bearing, sublicensable license to the Cpf1 Patent Rights for all other purposes, subject to certain limitations and retained rights. The licenses granted to us under the Cpf1 License Agreement exclude certain fields, including human germline modification; the stimulation of biased inheritance of particular genes or traits within a population of plants or animals; the research, development, manufacturing, or commercialization of sterile seeds; and the modification of the tobacco plant with specified exceptions.
 Tokyo and the National Institute of Health (“NIH”) are joint owners on certain Cpf1 Patent Rights. Broad has only granted a license to us with respect to its interests and to Tokyo’s interests in these U.S. patent applications but not to any foreign equivalents thereof. Broad does not, and does not purport to, grant any rights in NIH’s interest in these U.S. patent applications under our agreement. As a result, we may not have exclusive rights under any U.S. patents that issue from these U.S. patent applications and we may not have any rights under any foreign patents that issue from any foreign equivalents thereof.
 Pursuant to the Cpf1 License Agreement, and as of December 31, 2017, we have certain rights under one U.S. patent, three pending U.S. patent applications, one European patent and related validations, two pending European patent applications, five pending PCT patent applications, and other related patent applications in jurisdictions outside of the United States and Europe.
 We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, and commercialize licensed products in the Exclusive Cpf1 Field. We are also required to achieve certain development milestones within specified time periods for products covered by the Cpf1 Patent Rights, with Broad having the right to terminate the Cpf1 License Agreement if we fail to achieve these milestones within the required time periods. We have the right to sublicense our licensed rights provided that the sublicense agreement must be in compliance and consistent with the terms of the Cpf1 License Agreement. Any sublicense agreement cannot include the right to grant further sublicenses without the written consent of Broad. In addition, any sublicense agreements must contain certain terms, including a provision requiring the sublicensee to indemnify the Cpf1 Institutions according to the same terms as are provided in the Cpf1 License 

 
 
 23

 
Agreement and a statement that the Cpf1 Institutions are intended third party beneficiaries of the sublicense agreement for certain purposes.
 The licenses granted to us under the Cpf1 License Agreement are subject to retained rights of the U.S. government in the Cpf1 Patent Rights and rights retained by the Cpf1 Institutions on behalf of themselves and other academic, government and non‑profit entities, to practice the Cpf1 Patent Rights for research, teaching, or educational purposes. Our exclusive license rights also are subject to rights retained by the Cpf1 Institutions for themselves and any third party to research, develop, make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell, have sold, import or otherwise exploit the Cpf1 Patent Rights and licensed products as research products or research tools, or for research purposes.
 Under the Cpf1 License Agreement, Broad also retained rights to grant further licenses under specified circumstances to third parties that wish to develop and commercialize products that target a particular gene and that otherwise would fall within the scope of our exclusive license from Broad. Beginning in December 2018, if a third party requests a license under the Cpf1 Patent Rights for the development and commercialization of a product that would be subject to our exclusive license grant from Broad (a “Cpf1 Third Party Proposed Product Request”), Broad may notify us of such request. A Cpf1 Third Party Proposed Product Request must be accompanied by a research, development and commercialization plan reasonably satisfactory to Broad, including evidence that the third party has, or reasonably expects to have, access to any necessary intellectual property and funding. Broad may not grant a Cpf1 Third Party Proposed Product Request (i) if we, directly or through any of our affiliates, sublicensees, or collaborators are researching, developing, or commercializing a product directed to the same gene target that is the subject of the Cpf1Third Party Proposed Product Request (“Cpf1 Licensee Product”) and we can demonstrate such ongoing efforts to Broad’s reasonable satisfaction, or (ii) if we, directly or through any of our affiliates or sublicensees, wish to do so either alone or with a collaboration partner, and we can demonstrate to Broad’s reasonable satisfaction that we are interested in researching, developing, and commercializing a Cpf1 Licensee Product, that we have a commercially reasonable research, development, and commercialization plan to do so, and we commence and continue reasonable commercial efforts under such plan. If we, directly or through any of our affiliates, sublicensees, or collaborators, are not researching, developing, or commercializing a Cpf1 Licensee Product nor able to develop and implement a plan reasonably satisfactory to Broad, Broad may grant an exclusive or non‑exclusive license to the third party on a gene target‑by‑gene target basis.
 The Cpf1 License Agreement also provides Broad with the right, beginning in December 2017 and subject to certain limitations, to designate gene targets for which Broad, whether alone or together with a Cpf1 Institution, affiliate or third party, has an interest in researching and developing products that would otherwise be covered by rights licensed to us under the Cpf1 License Agreement. Broad may not so designate any gene target for which we, directly or through any of our affiliates, sublicensees, or collaborators, are researching, developing, or commercializing a product, or for which we can demonstrate to Broad’s reasonable satisfaction that we are interested in researching, developing, and commercializing a product, that we have a commercially reasonable research, development, and commercialization plan to do so, and we commence and continue reasonable commercial efforts under such plan. If we, directly or through any of our affiliates, sublicensees, or collaborators, are not researching, developing, or commercializing a product directed toward the gene target designated by Broad and are not able to develop and implement a plan reasonably satisfactory to Broad, Broad is entitled to reserve all rights under the Cpf1 License Agreement, including the right to grant exclusive or non‑exclusive licenses to third parties, to develop and commercialize products directed to such gene target, our license with respect to such gene target will terminate, and we will not be entitled under the Cpf1 License Agreement to develop and commercialize products directed to such gene target.
 Under the Cpf1 License Agreement, we paid Broad and Wageningen an aggregate upfront license fee in the mid seven digits and issued to Broad and Wageningen promissory notes (the “Initial Promissory Notes”) in an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million. The Initial Promissory Notes bore interest at 4.8% per annum. Principal and interest on the Initial Promissory Notes were payable on the first anniversary of the issuance date (or if earlier, a specified period of time following a sale of our company). We could elect to make any payment of amounts outstanding under the Initial Promissory Notes either in the form of cash or, subject to certain conditions, in shares of our common stock of equal value, with such shares being valued for such purpose at the closing price of our common stock as reported the Nasdaq Stock Market for the trading day immediately preceding the date of such payment if our common stock was then listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. In the event of a change of control of our company or a sale of our company, we were required to pay all remaining principal and accrued interest on the Initial Promissory Notes in cash within a specified 

 
 
 24

 
period following such event. We settled the Initial Promissory Notes in shares of our common stock in 2017 and they are no longer outstanding.
 Broad and Wageningen are collectively entitled to receive clinical and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $20.0 million in the aggregate per licensed product approved in the United States, the European Union and Japan for the prevention or treatment of a human disease that afflicts at least a specified number of patients in the aggregate in the United States. If we undergo a change of control during the term of the Cpf1 License Agreement, certain of these clinical and regulatory milestone payments will be increased by a certain percentage in the mid double‑digits. We are also obligated to make additional payments to Broad and Wageningen, collectively, of up to an aggregate of $54.0 million upon the occurrence of certain sales milestones per licensed product for the prevention or treatment of a human disease that afflicts at least a specified number of patients in the aggregate in the United States. Broad and Wageningen are collectively entitled to receive clinical and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $6.0 million in the aggregate per licensed product approved in the United States, the European Union and Japan for the prevention or treatment of an ultra‑orphan disease. We are also obligated to make additional payments to Broad and Wageningen, collectively, of up to an aggregate of $36.0 million upon the occurrence of certain sales milestones per licensed product for the prevention or treatment of an ultra‑orphan disease.
 Broad and Wageningen, collectively, are entitled to receive mid single‑digit percentage royalties on net sales of products for the prevention or treatment of human disease, and ranging from sub single‑digit to high single‑digit percentage royalties on net sales of other products and services, made by us, our affiliates, or our sublicensees. The royalty percentage depends on the product and service, and whether such licensed product or licensed service is covered by a valid claim within the Cpf1 Patent Rights. If we are legally required to pay royalties to a third party on net sales of our products because such third party holds patent rights that cover such licensed product, then we can credit up to a mid double‑digit percentage of the amount paid to such third party against the royalties due to Broad and Wageningen in the same period. Our obligation to pay royalties will expire on a product‑by‑product and country‑by‑country basis upon the later of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the Cpf1 Patent Rights that covers each licensed product or licensed service in each country or the tenth anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the product or service. If we sublicense any of the Cpf1 Patent Rights to a third party, Broad and Wageningen, collectively, have the right to receive high single‑digit to low double‑digit percentages of the sublicense income, depending on the stage of development of the products or services in question at the time of the sublicense.
 Under the Cpf1 License Agreement, Broad and Wageningen are also entitled, collectively, to receive success payments in the event our market capitalization reaches specified thresholds ascending from a high nine digit dollar amount to $10.0 billion (“Market Cap Success Payments”) or sale of our company for consideration in excess of those thresholds, (“Company Sale Success Payments,” which with the Market Cap Success Payments, the “Success Payments”). The Success Payments that may be paid to Broad and Wageningen range from a mid-seven digit dollar amount to a mid-eight digit dollar amount, and collectively will not exceed, in aggregate, $125.0 million, which maximum would be payable only if we achieve a market capitalization threshold of $10.0 billion and have at least one product candidate covered by a claim of a patent right licensed to us under either the Cpf1 License Agreement or the Cas9‑I License Agreement that is or was the subject of a clinical trial pursuant to development efforts by us or any of our affiliates or sublicensees. Market Cap Success Payments are payable by us in cash or in the form of promissory notes on substantially the same terms and conditions as the Initial Promissory Notes, except that the maturity date of such notes will, subject to certain exceptions, be 150 days following issuance. Following a change in control of our company, Market Cap Success Payments are required to be made in cash. Company Sale Success Payments are payable solely in cash.
 In March 2017, a Market Cap Success Payment in the amount of $5.0 million under the Cpf1 License Agreement became due upon our market capitalization reaching $750 million, and we issued promissory notes to Broad and Wageningen in the aggregate original principal amount of $5.0 million (the “March Success Payment Notes”). The principal and interest on the March Success Payment Notes was due and payable in August 2017. In August 2017, we issued an aggregate of 271,347 shares of our common stock to Broad and paid $0.4 million to Wageningen as payment of all outstanding principal and interest under the March Success Payment Notes. Upon such issuance and payment, the March Success Payment Notes were cancelled. In September 2017, Wageningen designated Broad as the recipient of any future promissory notes that are owed to Wageningen pursuant to the Cpf1 License Agreement.

 
 
 25

 

 In December 2017, a success payment in the amount of $5.0 million under the Cpf1 License Agreement became due upon our market capitalization reaching $1.0 billion for a specified period of time, and we issued a promissory note to Broad in the original principal amount of $5.0 million (the “December Cpf1 Success Payment Note”). The principal and interest on the December Cpf1 Success Payment Note was due and payable in May 2018. In January 2018, we issued 150,606 shares of our common stock to Broad as payment of all outstanding principal and interest under the December Cpf1 Success Payment Note. Upon such issuance and payment, the December Cpf1 Success Payment Note was cancelled. 
 In addition, in the event that a sale of our company or change of control has occurred and the maximum amount of potential Success Payments under the Cpf1 License Agreement has not been paid to Broad and Wageningen, Broad and Wageningen are entitled to receive, upon the subsequent achievement of specified regulatory milestones, percentages ranging from high single digits to mid‑to‑low double digits of the remaining unpaid maximum amount of Success Payments. Broad and Wageningen are further entitled to receive up to the full remaining unpaid maximum amount of Success Payments upon the subsequent achievement of specified sales milestones. All such post‑sale or post‑change of control milestone payments are required to be made in cash.
 Broad retains control of the prosecution and maintenance of the Cpf1 Patent Rights. We have the right to provide input in the prosecution of the Cpf1 Patent Rights, including to direct Broad to file and prosecute patents in certain countries. We are also obligated to reimburse Broad and Wageningen for all unreimbursed expenses incurred by them in connection with the prosecution and maintenance of the Cpf1 Patent Rights prior to the date of the Cpf1 License Agreement, and to reimburse Broad for expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the Cpf1 Patent Rights following the date of the Cpf1 License Agreement.
 We have the first right, but not the obligation, to enforce the Cpf1 Patent Rights with respect to our licensed products in the Exclusive Cpf1 Field so long as certain conditions are met, such as providing Broad and the applicable Cpf1 Institutions with evidence demonstrating a good faith basis for bringing suit against a third party. We are solely responsible for the costs of any lawsuits we elect to initiate and cannot enter into a settlement without the prior written consent of Broad. Any sums recovered in such lawsuits will be shared between Broad, Wageningen, and us.
 Unless terminated earlier, the term of the Cpf1 License Agreement will expire on a country‑by‑country basis, upon the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the Cpf1 Patent Rights in such country. However, our royalty obligations, discussed above, may survive expiration or termination. We have the right to terminate the Cpf1 License Agreement at will upon four months’ written notice to Broad. Either party may terminate the Cpf1 License Agreement upon a specified period of notice in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach of a material obligation, such notice period varying depending on the nature of the breach. Broad may terminate the Cpf1 License Agreement immediately if we challenge the enforceability, validity, or scope of any Cpf1 Patent Right or assist a third party to do so, or in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency.
 The Broad Institute—Cas9‑II License Agreement
 In December 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Broad for specified patent rights (the “Cas9‑II Patent Rights”) related primarily to certain Cas9 compositions of matter and their use for gene editing (the “Cas9‑II License Agreement”). Pursuant to the Cas9‑II License Agreement, Broad, on behalf of itself, MIT, Harvard, and the University of Iowa Research Foundation (“Iowa,” and collectively with the other institutions, the “Cas9‑II Institutions”), granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑bearing sublicensable license to certain of the Cas9‑II Patent Rights in the field of the prevention or treatment of human disease using gene therapy, editing of genetic material, or targeting of genetic material, subject to certain limitations and retained rights, as well as a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑bearing sublicensable license to all of the Cas9‑II Patent Rights for all purposes, subject to certain limitations and retained rights, in each case on terms substantially similar to the licenses granted to us under Cpf1 License Agreement, except that:
· | the terms relating to retained rights of the Cas9‑II Institutions to grant licenses to the Cas9‑II Patent Rights under specified circumstances to third parties, including to third parties that wish to develop and commercialize products that target a particular gene and that otherwise would fall within the scope of our exclusive license are on terms substantially similar to those under the Cas9‑I License Agreement;

Pursuant to the Cas9‑II License Agreement, and as of December 31, 2017, we have certain rights under 13 pending U.S. patent applications, 13 pending European patent applications, and other related patent applications in jurisdictions outside of the United States and Europe. 
    
In December 2017, a success payment in the amount of $2.5 million under our Cas9-II License Agreement became due upon our market capitalization reaching $1.0 billion for a specified period of time, and we issued a promissory note to Broad in the original principal amount of $2.5 million (the “December Cas9-II Success Payment Note”). The principal and interest on the December Cas9-II Success Payment Note was due and payable in May 2018. In January 2018, we issued 75,303 shares of our common stock to Broad as payment of all outstanding principal and interest under the December Cas9-II Success Payment Note. Upon such issuance and payment, the December Cas9-II Success Payment Note was cancelled.

 The General Hospital Corporation License Agreements
 In August 2014, we entered into a license agreement with The General Hospital Corporation, d/b/a Massachusetts General Hospital (“MGH”), for specified patent rights (the “First License MGH Patent Rights”) and specified know‑how and biological materials (the “First MGH License Agreement”). The First License MGH Patent Rights are directed, in part, to CRISPR/Cas9 and TALE‑related compositions of matter and their use for genome editing. Pursuant to the First MGH License Agreement, and as of December 31, 2017, we have certain rights under two U.S. patents, 14 pending U.S. patent applications, one European patent and related validations, ten pending European patent applications, and other related patent applications in jurisdictions outside of the United States and Europe.
 Pursuant to the First MGH License Agreement, MGH granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑bearing, sublicensable license to the First License MGH Patent Rights, to make, have made, use, have used, sell, offer for sale, and import products and processes in the fields of the prevention or treatment of human or animal disease and agriculture, which includes plants and animals bred and raised for human consumption (such field, the “First MGH Exclusive License Field”). Products and processes used for clinical diagnostic assays, and the research, development and sale of research tools, kits, and reagents in the field of agriculture are specifically excluded from our exclusive license to the First License MGH Patent Rights. MGH also granted us a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑bearing, sublicensable license to the First License MGH Patent Rights to make, have made, use, have used, sell, offer for sale, and import products and processes in substantially all fields other than the First MGH Exclusive License Field. Products and processes used for clinical diagnostic assays are specifically excluded from our non‑exclusive license to the First License MGH Patent Rights. In addition, MGH granted us a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑bearing sublicensable license under specified MGH know‑how and biological materials to make, have made, use, have used, sell, offer for sale, and import products and processes in all fields, except for products and processes used for clinical diagnostic assays. The licenses granted to us by MGH under the First MGH License Agreement are subject to retained rights of the U.S. government in the First License MGH Patent Rights and a royalty‑free right of MGH, academic, and not‑for‑profit institutions, to practice the First License MGH Patent Rights for educational, research, and clinical purposes.
 We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, and commercialize products and processes in the exclusive license field and outside the First MGH Exclusive License Field under the First MGH License Agreement. Also, we are required to achieve certain development milestones within specified time periods for products and processes in the First MGH Exclusive License Field and outside the First MGH Exclusive License Field. MGH has the right to terminate our license if we fail to achieve these development milestones.
 Under the First MGH License Agreement, we paid MGH an upfront license fee in the low six digit dollar amount and issued less than one percent of our common stock to MGH. We also must pay an annual license maintenance fee ranging from low‑ to mid‑five digit dollar amount, depending on the calendar year, beginning in 2017. We are obligated to reimburse MGH for expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the First License MGH Patent Rights, including expenses associated with any interference proceedings in the USPTO, any opposition proceedings in the EPO, or any other inter partes or other post grant proceedings in these or other jurisdictions where we are seeking patent protection.
 MGH is entitled to receive clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments totaling up to $1.4 million in the aggregate for the first licensed product or process, clinical, and regulatory milestone payments totaling up to $125,000 in the aggregate for each of the second, third, and fourth indications for which we conduct clinical trials of a licensed product or process and commercial milestone payments totaling up to $625,000 in the aggregate for each of the second, third, and fourth licensed products or process we introduce into the market. We are obligated to make additional payments to MGH of up to an aggregate of $1.8 million upon the occurrence of certain sales milestones.
 We are also obligated to pay MGH low single‑digit percentage royalties on net sales of products for the prevention or treatment of human disease, and ranging from low single‑digit to low double‑digit percentage royalties on net sales of other products and services made by us, our affiliates, or our sublicensees. The royalty percentage depends on the product and service, and whether such licensed product or licensed service is covered by a valid claim within the First License MGH Patent Rights. If we pay royalties to a third party on net sales of our products, then we can credit up to a mid double‑digit percentage of the amount paid to such third party against the royalties due to MGH. Our obligation to pay royalties will expire on a product‑by‑product and country‑by‑country basis upon the later of the expiration of the 

 
 
 28

 
last to expire valid claim of the First License MGH Patent Rights that cover the composition, manufacture or use of each covered product or service in each country or the tenth anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the product or service. If we sublicense any of the First License MGH Patent Rights or know‑how or materials licensed under the First MGH License Agreement to a third party in the First MGH Exclusive License Field, MGH has the right to receive a low double‑digit percentage of the sublicense income, which percentage decreases to a high single‑digit percentage after a specified period of time. If we sublicense any of the First License MGH Patent Rights or know‑how or materials licensed under the First MGH License Agreement to a third party in the field of research products or processes, MGH has the right to receive a high double‑digit percentage of the sublicense income. If we sublicense any of the First License MGH Patent Rights or know‑how or materials licensed under the First MGH License Agreement to a third party in any field outside the First MGH Exclusive License Field and outside the field of research products or processes, MGH has the right to receive a low double‑digit percentage of the sublicense income.
 MGH retains control of the prosecution and maintenance of the First License MGH Patent Rights. We have the right to provide input in the prosecution of the First License MGH Patent Rights, including directing MGH to file and prosecute patents in certain countries. MGH controls the enforcement of the First License MGH Patent Rights, except for the enforcement of the rights exclusively licensed to us, which we control at our expense. We may not enter into any settlement without the prior written consent of MGH. We also retain the first right to defend against any legal or administrative action taken by a third party against a First License MGH Patent Right at our own costs.
 Unless terminated earlier, the term of the First MGH License Agreement will expire, on a country‑by‑country basis, upon the expiration or abandonment of all First License MGH Patent Rights in such country. However, our royalty obligations, discussed above, may survive expiration or termination. We have the right to terminate the First MGH License Agreement at will upon 90 days’ written notice to MGH. MGH may terminate the First MGH License Agreement upon a specified period of written notice in the event of our uncured material breach, such notice period varying depending on the nature of the breach. MGH also may terminate the First MGH License Agreement immediately if we challenge the enforceability, validity, or scope of any First License MGH Patent Right or assist a third party to do so, or in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency.
 In August 2016, we entered into a second license agreement with MGH for specified patent rights (the “Second License MGH Patent Rights” and such agreement, the “Second MGH License Agreement”). Pursuant to the Second MGH License Agreement, and as of December 31, 2017, we have certain rights under two issued U.S. patents, six pending U.S. patent applications, one pending European patent application, one pending PCT patent application, and other related patent applications in jurisdictions outside of the United States and Europe. The Second License MGH Patent Rights are directed, in part, to CRISPR/Cas9 compositions of matter and their use for genome editing.
 Pursuant to the Second MGH License Agreement, MGH granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑bearing, sublicensable license to the Second License MGH Patent Rights, to make, have made, use, have used, sell, offer for sale and have sold products and processes in the fields of the prevention and treatment of human and animal disease, or collectively, the Second MGH Exclusive Field. MGH also granted us a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑bearing, sublicensable license to use research data and other information pertaining to the Second License MGH Patent Rights to make, have made, use, have used, sell, offer for sale and have sold products and processes in the Second MGH Exclusive Field. The licenses granted to us by MGH under the Second MGH License Agreement are subject to retained rights of the U.S. government in the Second License MGH Patent Rights and the royalty‑free right of MGH, its affiliates, and academic, government, and not‑for‑profit institutions to practice the Second License MGH Patent Rights for research and educational purposes.
 We are obligated under the Second MGH License Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, and commercialize products and processes in the Second MGH Exclusive Field. As part of these obligations, we are required to achieve certain development milestones within specified time periods, with MGH having the right to terminate the Second MGH License Agreement if we fail to achieve these milestones within the required time periods.
 Under the Second MGH License Agreement, we paid MGH an upfront license fee in the high six digits. We also must pay an annual license maintenance fee beginning in 2018 that increases over time within a specified dollar range in the low six digits, with such maintenance fee being creditable against any royalties due to MGH under the 

 
 
 29

 
Second MGH License Agreement in the same calendar year. We are obligated to reimburse MGH for expenses associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the Second License MGH Patent Rights.
 MGH is entitled to receive clinical and regulatory milestone payments totaling less than $1.0 million in the aggregate for up to four licensed products or processes to achieve the specified clinical and regulatory milestones. In addition, MGH is entitled to receive commercial sales milestone payments totaling up to $4.9 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of milestones relating to first commercial sales of up to four licensed products or processes in the United States and abroad as well as milestones relating to annual net sales of products or processes meeting specified thresholds.
 We are also obligated to pay MGH royalties of less than 1% on net sales of products and processes for the prevention or treatment of human disease, and royalties of a low single‑digit percentage on net sales of products and processes for the prevention or treatment of a non‑human animal disease, made by us, our affiliates, or our sublicensees. Our obligation to pay royalties will expire on a product/process‑by‑product/process and country‑by‑country basis upon the later of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the Second License MGH Patent Rights that covers the applicable product or process and the tenth anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the applicable product or process. The royalty percentages that we are obligated to pay are subject to reduction if at the time of sale the applicable product or process is not covered by a valid claim within the Second License MGH Patent Rights. If we pay royalties to a third party on net sales of a product or process for which a royalty is due under both First MGH License Agreement and the Second MGH License Agreement, we can credit up to a mid double‑digit percentage of the amount paid to such third party against the royalties due to MGH under the Second MGH License Agreement, provided that the royalties due to MGH under the Second MGH License Agreement may not be reduced by more than a low to mid double‑digit percentage.
 Under the Second MGH License Agreement, MGH is also entitled to receive certain payments in the event our market capitalization reaches specified thresholds ranging from low to high ten digit dollar amounts (the “MGH Market Cap Success Payments”). The MGH Market Cap Success Payments payable to MGH range from a low seven digit dollar amount to a low eight digit dollar amount, which low eight digit dollar amount would be payable only if we achieve at least market capitalization of a high ten digit dollar amount and if we have one licensed product that (i) is the subject of a Phase 1 clinical trial of which we or one of our affiliates or sublicensees is the sponsor, (ii) was the subject of a Phase 1 clinical trial of which we or one of our affiliates or sublicensees was the sponsor with us having determined to conduct a subsequent clinical trial with respect to such product candidate, or (iii) has been approved for sale in either the United States or the European Union. In addition, in the event of an asset sale or merger of our company to a third party for consideration in excess of one or more market capitalization thresholds, we must pay MGH all MGH Market Cap Success Payments corresponding to such market capitalization thresholds that have not previously been paid (the “MGH Company Sale Success Payments”). MGH Market Cap Success Payments are payable in cash or shares of our common stock at our discretion, and MGH Company Sale Success Payments are payable solely in cash. In December 2017, an MGH Market Cap Success Payment of $2.0 million became due under our Second MGH License Agreement in connection with our market capitalization reaching $1.0 billion, which we settled in January 2018 through the issuance of 80,000 shares of our common stock to MGH.
 MGH retains control of the prosecution and maintenance of the Second License MGH Patent Rights. We have the right to provide input in the prosecution of the Second License MGH Patent Rights, including to direct MGH to file and prosecute patents in certain countries at our cost. We control, at our expense, the enforcement of the rights exclusively licensed to us. We may not enter into any settlement without the prior written consent of MGH. We also retain the first right to defend against any legal or administrative action taken by a third party against a Second License MGH Patent Right at our own cost.
 Unless terminated earlier, the term of the Second MGH License Agreement will expire upon the expiration or abandonment of all the Second License MGH Patent Rights. However, our royalty obligations may survive expiration or termination. We have the right to terminate the Second MGH License Agreement at will upon 90 days written notice to MGH. MGH may terminate the Second MGH License Agreement upon specified periods of written notice in the event of our uncured material breach, with the length of such notice period varying depending on the nature of the breach. MGH also may terminate the license agreement immediately if we challenge the validity of any Second License MGH Patent Rights or in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency.

 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our platform technology, programs, and know‑how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, exclusively licensing and filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our platform technology, existing and planned programs, and improvements that are important to the development of our business, where patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets, know‑how, continuing technological innovation, and confidential information to develop and maintain our proprietary position and protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
 Our in‑licensed patents and patent applications cover various aspects of our genome editing platform technology, including CRISPR systems that employ Cas9 including S. aureus Cas9, high‑fidelity Cas9 nucleases and Cas9 PAM variants, self‑inactivating forms of Cas9, Cas9 nickases, CRISPR systems that employ Cpf1 including Cpf1 nickases and other variants and self‑inactivating forms of Cpf1, and also CRISPR systems that employ viral vectors for delivery, single guide RNAs, or modified guide RNAs. We also have filed patent applications and have in‑licensed rights to filed patent applications directed to each of the four components of our genome editing platform technology. We intend to pursue, when possible, additional patent protection, including composition of matter, method of use, and process claims, directed to each component of our platform technology. We also intend to obtain rights to existing delivery technologies through one or more licenses from third parties.
 Notwithstanding these efforts, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we have licensed or filed or may license or file in the future, and we cannot be sure that any patents we have licensed or patents that may be licensed or granted to us in the future will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. Moreover, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 As of December 31, 2017, we owned one U.S patent, 19 pending U.S. non‑provisional patent applications, 16 pending European patent applications, 16 pending U.S. provisional patent applications, 16 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) patent applications, and other related patent applications in jurisdictions outside the United States and Europe, which include claims to compositions of matter and methods of use. One of these U.S. patents and its U.S. and foreign counterpart applications are co‑owned with Broad and Iowa and we have obtained an exclusive license to such co‑ownership rights from these third parties in the field of prevention or treatment of human disease using gene therapy or genome editing. In addition, three of these pending PCT patent applications and four of these pending U.S. provisional patent applications are co‑owned with certain of our collaborators because they encompass inventions developed under our collaborations. We intend to pursue, when possible, composition of matter, method of use, dosing, and formulation patent protection for genome editing products that we develop during the course of our business.
 As of December 31, 2017, we in‑licensed 44 U.S. patents, which include claims to compositions of matter, methods of use, and certain processes as well as approximately 103 pending U.S. non‑provisional patent applications, 13 European patents and related validations, 66 pending European patent applications, six pending PCT patent applications, and other related patent applications in jurisdictions outside the United States and Europe, which include claims to compositions of matter, methods of use, and certain processes. The patents and patent applications outside of the United States and Europe are held primarily in Canada, Japan, and Australia, although some of our in‑licensed patent families were filed in a larger number of countries. Our in‑licensed patents and patent applications claim the inventions of investigators at various universities and institutions and the majority of these licensed patents and patent applications are licensed on an exclusive basis. The exclusive licenses are, in some cases, limited to certain technical fields. Certain U.S. patent applications licensed to us by Broad include Tokyo and NIH as joint applicants. Broad has only granted a license 

 
 
 31

 
to us with respect to its interests and to Tokyo’s interests in these U.S. patent applications but not to any foreign equivalents thereof. Broad does not and does not purport to grant any rights in NIH’s interest in these U.S. patent applications under our agreement. As a result, we may not have exclusive rights under any U.S. patents that issue from these U.S. patent applications and we may not have any rights under any foreign patents that issue from any foreign equivalents thereof. For more information regarding these license agreements, please see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled “Business —Intellectual Property Licenses.”
 On January 11, 2016, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the USPTO (the “PTAB”) declared an interference between a pending U.S. patent application (U.S. Serial No. 13/842,859) that is owned by the University of California, the University of Vienna, and Emmanuelle Charpentier and 12 U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,697,359; 8,771,945; 8,795,965; 8,865,406; 8,871,445; 8,889,356; 8,895,308; 8,906,616; 8,932,814; 8,945,839; 8,993,233; and 8,999,641) that are co‑owned by Broad and MIT, and in some cases Harvard, and in‑licensed by us. On March 17, 2016, the PTAB re‑declared the interference to add a pending U.S. patent application (U.S. Serial No. 14/704,551) that is co‑owned by Broad, MIT, and Harvard, and in‑licensed by us. An interference is a proceeding within the USPTO to determine priority of invention of the subject matter of patent claims filed by different parties. In the interference, the University of California, the University of Vienna and Emmanuelle Charpentier asserted that inventors from the University of California and the University of Vienna, and Emmanuelle Charpentier made certain inventions claimed in the Broad, MIT and Harvard patents before the inventors from Broad, MIT and, in certain cases, Harvard. The declaration of interference defined the invention that was subject to the declaration of interference, also referred to as “the count,” as relating to a method that involves contacting a target DNA in a eukaryotic cell with certain defined CRISPR/Cas9 components for the purpose of cleaving or editing a target DNA molecule or modulating transcription of at least one gene encoded thereon. All of the claims in the pending U.S. patent application that is owned by the University of California, the University of Vienna, and Emmanuelle Charpentier and all of the claims in the 12 U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent application that are co-owned by Broad and MIT, and in some cases, Harvard, and in-licensed by us were implicated in the interference.
 On February 15, 2017, the PTAB held that there is no interference‑in‑fact between the parties for the subject matter of the count. A judgment of no interference‑in‑fact means that no interference is needed to resolve priority between the parties because the PTAB determined that our in-licensed claims are directed to subject matter that is patentably distinct from those of the University of California, the University of Vienna, and Emmanuelle Charpentier. The interference proceeding has therefore ended. Therefore, the 12 U.S. patents and one U.S. patent application that we have in‑licensed from Broad, acting on behalf of itself, MIT, and Harvard, as well as the U.S. patent application owned by the University of California, the University of Vienna, and Emmanuelle Charpentier, with respect to which the PTAB had declared an interference were not modified or revoked as a result of this interference proceeding. 
 Having filed a notice of appeal on April 12, 2017, the University of California, the University of Vienna, and Emmanuelle Charpentier filed an appeal brief to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on July 25, 2017 for review of the no interference-in-fact decision made by the PTAB in the interference proceeding. Broad filed its responsive brief on October 25, 2017. The University of California, the University of Vienna and Emmanuelle Charpentier filed a reply brief on November 22, 2017. It is uncertain when or in what manner the Federal Circuit will act on this appeal. A final, non‑appealable judgment of no interference‑in‑fact bars any further interference between the same parties for claims to the same invention as the count of the interference. However, as discussed below, certain of these 12 U.S. patents and one U.S. patent application are, or may in the future be, subject to further intellectual property proceedings and disputes, including interference proceedings.
 Separately, ToolGen Inc. (“Toolgen”) filed Suggestions of Interference in the USPTO on April 13, 2015 suggesting that it believes some of the claims pending in its applications (U.S. Serial No. 14/685,568 and U.S. Serial No. 14/685,510) interfere with certain claims in five U.S. patents, which we have in‑licensed from Broad, acting on behalf of itself, MIT, and Harvard. These five U.S. patents are among the 12 U.S. patents with respect to which the PTAB had declared an interference with the pending U.S. patent application (U.S. Serial No. 13/842, 859) that is owned by the University of California, the University of Vienna, and Emmanuelle Charpentier. The Suggestions of Interference that were filed by ToolGen are still pending, and it is uncertain when and in what manner the USPTO will act on them.
 A request for ex parte re‑examination was filed with the USPTO on February 16, 2016 against one patent that we have in‑licensed from Broad, acting on behalf of itself and MIT (U.S. Patent No. 8,771,945), which was subject to 

 
 
 32

 
the interference proceeding involving the University of California, the University of Vienna, and Emmanuelle Charpentier and referenced in the Suggestions of Interference filed by ToolGen. Ex parte re‑examination is a procedure through which a third party can anonymously request the USPTO to re‑examine a granted patent because the third party believes the granted patent may not be patentable over prior art in the form of a printed publication or another patent. Before the USPTO will re‑examine a granted patent, the third party requestor must establish that the submitted prior art establishes a substantial and new question of patentability. If the USPTO determines there is a substantial and new question of patentability, it grants the re‑examination request and re‑examines the patent after giving the patent owner the option of filing an initial statement. The request for ex parte re‑examination of U.S. Patent No. 8,771,945 was granted on May 9, 2016 thereby initiating a re‑examination procedure between the USPTO and Broad, acting on behalf of itself and MIT. The third party requestor does not participate in the re‑examination procedure after filing the request except that it has the option of responding if the patent owner chooses to file an initial statement. On May 12, 2016, the PTAB suspended the re‑examination of U.S. Patent No. 8,771,945 noting that it has jurisdiction over any file that involves a patent involved in the interference. It is uncertain when the PTAB will lift the suspension, however the PTAB may do so in light of the PTAB’s no interference‑in‑fact holding. If Broad is unsuccessful during the re‑examination, U.S. Patent No. 8,771,945 may be revoked or narrowed.
 The 12 in‑licensed U.S. patents and one in‑licensed U.S. patent application that were the subject of the interference with the pending U.S. patent application (U.S. Serial No. 13/842,859) that is owned by the University of California, the University of Vienna, and Emmanuelle Charpentier (which includes the five in‑licensed U.S. patents that are the subject of the Suggestions of Interference filed by ToolGen and the one in‑licensed U.S. patent that is the subject of the request for ex parte re‑examination) relate generally to the CRISPR/Cas9 system and its use in eukaryotic cells. The claims of the 12 in‑licensed U.S. patents and one in‑licensed U.S. patent application vary in scope and coverage and include claims that are directed to CRISPR/Cas9 systems that employ viral vectors for delivery, single guide RNAs, modified guide RNAs, S. aureus Cas9, or a Cas9 nickase and are relevant to our genome editing platform technology. The loss or narrowing in scope of one or more of these in-licensed patents could have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business.
 In addition, we or our licensors may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators, or other third parties have an interest in our owned or in‑licensed patents, patent applications, or other intellectual property as an inventor or co‑inventor. If we are unable to obtain an exclusive license to any such third party co‑owners’ interest in such patents or patent applications, such co‑owners may be able to license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors. In addition, we may need the cooperation of any such co‑owners to enforce such patents against third parties, and such cooperation may not be provided to us.
 We or our licensors are subject to and may in the future become a party to similar proceedings or priority disputes in Europe or other foreign jurisdictions. On January 17, 2018, the European Patent Office Opposition Division (the “Opposition Division”) revoked in the European Patent Office (the “EPO”) a European patent that we have in‑licensed from Broad, acting on behalf of itself, MIT and Harvard (European Patent No. EP 2,771,468 B1). On January 18, 2018, Broad, acting on behalf of itself, MIT and Harvard filed a notice of appeal to the Boards of Appeal of the EPO for review of the Opposition Division’s decision to revoke this patent. It is uncertain when or in what manner the Boards of Appeal will act on this appeal. The Opposition Division has also initiated opposition proceedings against six other European patents that we have in‑licensed from Broad, acting on behalf of itself, MIT and Harvard (European Patent Nos. EP 2,784,162 B1, EP 2,896,697 B1, EP 2,898,075 B1, EP 2,921,557 B1, EP 2,931,898 B1, and EP 3,009,511 B1), one European patent that we have in‑licensed from Broad, acting on behalf of itself and MIT (European Patent No. EP 2,764,103 B1), and two European patents that we have in-licensed from Broad, acting on behalf of itself, MIT, Harvard and Rockefeller (European Patent Nos. EP 2,825,654 B1 and EP 2,840,140 B1). The EPO opposition proceedings may involve issues including, but not limited to, procedural formalities related to filing the European patent application, priority, and the patentability of the involved claims. One or more of the third parties that have filed oppositions against European Patent Nos. EP 2,771,468 B1, EP 2,784,162 B1, EP 2,764,103 B1, EP 2,825,654 B1, EP 2,840,140 B1, EP 2,896,697 B1, EP 2,898,075 B1, EP 2,921,557 B1, EP 2,931,898 B1, and/or EP 3,009,511 B1 or other third parties may file future oppositions against other European patents that we in‑license or own. For example, we are aware that notices of opposition have been filed against one other European patent that we in-license from Broad, acting on behalf of itself, MIT and Harvard (European Patent No. EP 2,931,897 B1). The deadline for filing oppositions against this European patent is August 1, 2018. There may be other oppositions against this European patent that have not yet been filed or that 

 
 
 33

 
have not yet been made available to the public. The loss of priority for, or the loss of, these European patents could have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business.
 For more information regarding the risks associated with the interference, the Suggestions of Interference, the request for ex parte re‑examination, the European oppositions, and other potential third party intellectual property related disputes, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non‑provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug or a method for using it may be extended.
 CRISPR
 As of December 31, 2017, we owned one U.S. patent, 19 pending U.S. non‑provisional patent applications, 16 pending European patent applications, 16 pending U.S. provisional patent applications, 16 pending PCT patent applications, and other related patent applications in jurisdictions outside the United States and Europe that are related to our CRISPR technology and which include claims directed to our genome editing platform, including our directed editing component, as well as composition of matter and method of use claims for our therapeutic programs, including LCA10 and other genetic and infectious eye disorders, and engineered T cells. One of these U.S. patents and its U.S. and foreign counterpart applications is co‑owned with Broad and Iowa and we have obtained an exclusive license to such co‑ownership rights from these third parties in the field of prevention or treatment of human disease using gene therapy or genome editing. In addition, three of these pending PCT patent applications and four of these pending U.S. provisional patent applications are co‑owned with certain of our collaborators because they encompass inventions developed under our collaborations. If issued as U.S. patents, and if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, the U.S. patent applications would be expected to expire between 2034 and 2038, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.
 As of December 31, 2017, we in‑licensed 35 U.S. patents, 11 European patents and related validations, and over 500 pending patent applications, including approximately 91 pending U.S. non‑provisional patent applications, 57 pending European patent applications, six pending PCT patent applications, and other related patent applications in jurisdictions outside the United States and Europe that are related to our CRISPR technology collectively from various universities and institutions. The claims from our in‑licensed portfolio include claims to compositions of matter, methods of use, and certain processes. These include claims directed to CRISPR systems that employ Cas9 including Cas9 nickases, S. aureus Cas9, high‑fidelity Cas9 nucleases, Cas9 PAM variants and self‑inactivating forms of Cas9, CRISPR systems that employ Cpf1 including Cpf1 nickases and other variants and self-inactivating forms of Cpf1, and also CRISPR systems that employ viral vectors for delivery, single guide RNAs, or modified guide RNAs. Our current in‑licensed U.S. patents, if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid, are expected to expire between 2033 and 2036, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions.

Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the gene therapy and genome‑editing fields, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on intellectual property and proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience, and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, biotechnology companies, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies may become available in the future.
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other related markets that utilize technologies encompassing genomic medicines to create therapies, including genome editing and gene therapy. There are additional companies that are working to develop therapies in areas related to our research programs. Our platform and product focus is the development of therapies using CRISPR technology. Other companies developing CRISPR technology include Caribou Biosciences, Casebia Therapeutics, CRISPR Therapeutics, ERS Genomics, Exonics Therapeutics, Intellia Therapeutics, and TRACR Hematology. In addition, there have been and may continue to be discoveries of new CRISPR‑based gene editing technologies. There are additional companies developing therapies using other genome editing technologies, including TALENs, meganucleases, Mega‑TALs, and zinc finger nucleases. The companies developing these other genome editing technologies include bluebird bio, Cellectis, Poseida Therapeutics, Precision Biosciences, and Sangamo Therapeutics. Additional companies developing gene therapy products include Abeona Therapeutics, Adverum Biotechnologies, AGTC Therapeutics, Audentes Therapeutics, Homology Medicines, Nightstar Therapeutics, REGENXBIO, Spark Therapeutics, uniQure, and Voyager Therapeutics. In addition to competition from other genome editing therapies or gene therapies, any products that we develop may also face competition from other types of therapies, such as small molecule, antibody, protein, oligonucleotide, or ribonucleic acid therapies.
 In addition, many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, may have greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and gene therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early‑stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, and availability of reimbursement.
 If our current programs are approved for the indications for which we are currently planning clinical trials, they may compete with other products currently under development, including genome editing and gene therapy products. Competition with other related products currently under development may include competition for clinical trial sites, patient recruitment, and product sales.

 Manufacturing
 We currently contract with third parties for the manufacturing of our materials for preclinical studies and our planned clinical trials. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our program materials. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. The use of contracted manufacturing and reliance on collaboration partners is relatively cost‑efficient and has eliminated the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional staff early in development. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with manufacturing experience to oversee our contract manufacturers. We expect third‑party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our program materials to meet anticipated needs for preclinical studies and clinical trials. To meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, third parties with whom we currently work might need to increase their scale of production or we will need to secure alternate suppliers. We believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our preclinical, clinical, and commercial requirements, although we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs. Commercialization
 We currently intend to build the commercial infrastructure in the United States and Europe necessary to effectively support the commercialization of all of our programs, if and when we first believe a regulatory approval of a product candidate under one of our programs in a particular geographic market appears probable. The commercial infrastructure for orphan products typically consists of a targeted, specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians supported by sales management, medical liaisons, internal sales support, an internal marketing group, and distribution support.
 Additional capabilities important to the orphan marketplace include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies, and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that any product candidate we may develop will be approved.
 Outside of the United States and Europe, where appropriate, we may elect in the future to utilize strategic partners, distributors, or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our products. In certain instances, we may consider building our own commercial infrastructure.
 As product candidates advance through our pipeline, our commercial plans may change. In particular, some of our research programs target potentially larger indications. Data, the size of the development programs, the size of the target market, the size of a commercial infrastructure, and manufacturing needs may all influence our strategies in the United States, Europe, and the rest of the world.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products, including biological products. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 Licensure and Regulation of Biologics in the United States
 In the United States, our candidate products would be regulated as biological products, or biologics, under the Public Health Service Act (the “PHSA”) and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and its implementing regulations and guidances. The failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, including non‑clinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process or post‑approval

process, may subject an applicant to delays in the conduct of the study, regulatory review and approval, and/or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions may include, but are not limited to, the FDA’s refusal to allow an applicant to proceed with clinical testing, refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension, or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, adverse publicity, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, and civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA or the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and other governmental entities, including state agencies.
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new biologic in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps:

· | preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency, and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication, in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation and submission to the FDA of a Biologic License Application (“BLA”) for a biologic product requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications, including submission of detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product in clinical development and proposed labelling;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity, and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practice (“GTP”) for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the non‑clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of clinical data in support of the BLA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | payment of user Prescription Drug User Free Act (“PDUFA”) securing FDA approval of the BLA and licensure of the new biologic product; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | compliance with any post‑approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) and any post‑approval studies required by the FDA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Preclinical Studies and Investigational New Drug Application
 Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, including a gene therapy product candidate, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate the potential for efficacy and toxicity in animal studies. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. 

 
 
 37

 

 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the product or conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before the clinical trials can begin.
 As a result, submission of the IND may result in the FDA not allowing the trials to commence or allowing the trial to commence on the terms originally specified by the sponsor in the IND. If the FDA raises concerns or questions either during this initial 30‑day period, or at any time during the IND process, it may choose to impose a partial or complete clinical hold. This order issued by the FDA would delay either a proposed clinical study or cause suspension of an ongoing study, until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed. This could cause significant delays or difficulties in completing planned clinical studies in a timely manner.
 With gene therapy protocols, if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (“RAC”) of the NIH decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non‑compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of a BLA
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients with the disease to be treated under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator in accordance with GCP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the trial complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the trial as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, the FDA requires that such trials be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical trials. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical trials, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign trials are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for clinical trials in the United States.
 Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, clinical trial design, patient informed consent, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. The FDA, IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP rules and the requirements for informed consent. 
 Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group may recommend continuation of the study as planned, changes in study conduct, or cessation of the study at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. Finally, research activities involving infectious agents, hazardous chemicals, recombinant DNA, and genetically altered organisms and agents may be subject to review and approval of an Institutional Biosafety 

 
 
 38

 
Committee in accordance with NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules.
 Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may be required after approval.

· | Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion, and pharmacodynamics in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3 clinical trials proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy, and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well‑controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a biologic; such Phase 3 studies are referred to as “pivotal.”
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In some cases, the FDA may approve a BLA for a product candidate but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product candidate’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post‑approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of biologics approved under accelerated approval regulations. If the FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase 4 clinical trial requirement or to request a change in the product labeling. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
 Special Regulations and Guidance Governing Gene Therapy Products
 It is possible that the procedures and standards applied to gene therapy products and cell therapy products may be applied to any CRISPR product candidates we may develop, but that remains uncertain at this point. The FDA has defined a gene therapy product as one that mediates its effects by transcription and/or translation of transferred genetic material and/or by integrating into the host genome and which are administered as nucleic acids, viruses, or genetically engineered microorganisms. The products may be used to modify cells in vivo or transferred to cells ex vivo prior to administration to the recipient. Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) regulates gene therapy products. Within the CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. The CBER works closely with the NIH and the RAC, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical, and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing, and control information in gene therapy INDs.
 In addition to the foregoing, products classified as gene therapies are subject to additional regulation. The FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies. Although the FDA has indicated that these guidance documents are not legally binding, we believe that our compliance with them is likely necessary to gain approval for any product candidate we may develop. The guidance documents provide additional factors that the FDA will consider at 

 
 
 39

 
each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things, the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing, and control information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. Further, the FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy‑related delayed adverse events for a 15‑year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire.

If a gene therapy trial is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving the NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, a protocol and related documentation must be submitted to, and the study registered with, the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities (“OBA”) pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA. In addition, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH will convene the RAC, a federal advisory committee, to discuss protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA web site and may be accessed by the public.
 Finally, to facilitate adverse event reporting and dissemination of additional information about gene therapy trials, the FDA and the NIH established the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System or GeMCRIS. Investigators and sponsors of a human gene transfer trials can utilize this web‑based system to report serious adverse events and annual reports. GeMCRIS also allows members of the public to access basic reports about human gene transfer trials registered with the NIH and to search for information such as trial location, the names of investigators conducting trials, and the names of gene transfer products being studied.

Compliance with cGMP and GTP Requirements
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in full compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products like biologics whose attributes cannot be precisely defined.
 For a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with GTP. These standards are found in FDA regulations and guidances that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products (“HCT/Ps”), which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing.
 Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of products must also register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Any product manufactured by or imported from a facility that has not registered, whether foreign or domestic, is deemed misbranded under the FDCA. Establishments may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Inspections must follow a “risk‑based schedule” that may result in certain establishments being inspected more frequently. Manufacturers may also have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated.

 Review and Approval of a BLA
 The results of product candidate development, preclinical testing, and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting license to market the product. The BLA must contain extensive manufacturing information and detailed information on the composition of the product and proposed labeling as well as payment of a user fee. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2018 is $2,421,495 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2018 is $304,162. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.
 The FDA has 60 days after submission of the application to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth review of the application. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA, the FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority review of the application. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs. The review process may often be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or if the applicant otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
 Under the PHSA, the FDA may approve a BLA if it determines that the product is safe, pure, and potent and the facility where the product will be manufactured meets standards designed to ensure that it continues to be safe, pure, and potent.
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities and any FDA audits of non‑clinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. If the application is not approved, the FDA will issue a complete response letter, which will contain the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application, and when possible will outline recommended actions the sponsor might take to obtain approval of the application. Sponsors that receive a complete response letter may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA. Such resubmissions are classified under PDUFA as either Class 1 or Class 2. The classification of a resubmission is based on the information submitted by an applicant in response to an action letter. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has two months to review a Class 1 resubmission and six months to review a Class 2 resubmission. The FDA will not approve an application until issues identified in the complete response letter have been addressed.
 The FDA may also refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. In particular, the FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates, and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product. It may also require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may call for post‑approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess the product’s safety after approval. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain 

 
 
 41

 
circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post‑market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation and regenerative advanced therapy designation.
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 Second, in 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”). This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as “breakthrough therapies.” A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross‑disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case‑by‑case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment‑limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
 With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”) in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.

 Accelerated Approval Pathway
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life‑threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”) and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a product, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product.
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post‑approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post‑marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post‑approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post‑approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post‑marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 Post‑Approval Regulation
 If regulatory approval for marketing of a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all regular post‑approval regulatory requirements as well as any post‑approval requirements that the FDA have imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third‑party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.
 A product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official lot release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, 

 
 
 43

 
the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post‑market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning letters or holds on post‑approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

  The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information. In the United States, health care professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug’s labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. 
 If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion, and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Orphan drug designation in the United States is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United 

 
 
 44

 
States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the biologic for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
 Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for tax credits and market exclusivity for seven years following the date of the product’s marketing approval if granted by the FDA. An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. A product becomes an orphan when it receives orphan drug designation from the Office of Orphan Products Development at the FDA based on acceptable confidential requests made under the regulatory provisions. The product must then go through the review and approval process like any other product.
 A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved product or new orphan indication for an already marketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek and obtain orphan drug designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition if it can present a plausible hypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first drug. More than one sponsor may receive orphan drug designation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking orphan drug designation must file a complete request for designation.
 The period of exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA and applies only to the indication for which the product has been designated. The FDA may approve a second application for the same product for a different use or a second application for a clinically superior version of the product for the same use. The FDA cannot, however, approve the same product made by another manufacturer for the same indication during the market exclusivity period unless it has the consent of the sponsor or the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities.
 Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, a BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 For products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors and FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than 90 days after FDA’s receipt of the study plan.
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non‑patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non‑patent and orphan exclusivity. This six‑month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or 

 
 
 45

 
patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in March 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”). The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. As of January 1, 2018, the FDA has approved nine biosimilar products for use in the United States. No interchangeable biosimilars, however, have been approved. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Additional guidances are expected to be finalized by the FDA in the near term.
 Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 A patent claiming a new biologic product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch‑Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one‑half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
 FDA Approval of Companion Diagnostics
 In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the drug therapeutic and in vitro companion diagnostic device on issues related to co-development of the products.  

 
 
 46

 

 Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post‑market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution.
 The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product candidate to obtain pre-market approval (“PMA”) simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $250,000 for most PMAs; for federal fiscal year 2018, the standard fee for review of a PMA is $310,764 and the small business fee is $77,691. 
     After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
 The 21st Century Cures Act
 On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed the Cures Act into law. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increased funding for the FDA to spend on innovation projects. The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) to reauthorize and expand funding for the NIH. The Cures Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigators and research. It also charges the NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research. Further, the Cures Act directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand surveillance of neurological diseases.
 With amendments to the FDCA and the PHSA, Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the existing priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases until 2020; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications; requires the FDA to evaluate the potential use of “real world evidence” to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; provides a new “limited population” approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorizes the FDA to designate a drug as a “regenerative advanced therapy,” thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations.
 Regulation and Procedures Governing Approval of Medicinal Products in the European Union
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. Specifically, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and 

 
 
 47

 
well‑controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application (“MAA”) and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the European Union.
 Clinical Trial Approval
 Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of member states. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will become applicable no earlier than 2019. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the European Union. Specifically, the new legislation, which will be directly applicable in all member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. For instance, the new Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
 PRIME Designation in the EU
 In March 2016, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority Medicines (“PRIME”) scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated EMA contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (“CHMP”) or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at the EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
 Marketing Authorization
 To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under the European Union regulatory system, an applicant must submit an MAA, either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in European Union Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure, or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA‑approved Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”), covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product‑specific waiver, class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU member states. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated 

 
 
 48

 
for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.
 Specifically, the grant of marketing authorization in the European Union for products containing viable human tissues or cells such as gene therapy medicinal products is governed by Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community code on medicinal products. Regulation 1394/2007/EC lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision, and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products, and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of advanced therapy medicinal products must demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to EMA which provides an opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization in light of the opinion delivered by EMA.
 Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP established at the EMA is responsible for conducting an initial assessment of a product. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
 Regulatory Data Protection in the European Union
 In the European Union, new chemical entities approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for a period of eight years. During the additional two‑year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten‑year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals
 A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed after five years on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk‑benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To that end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five‑year renewal period. Any authorization that is not followed by the placement of the drug on the EU market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid.

 
 
 49

 

 Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization
 Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include compliance with the European Union’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post‑authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. In addition, the manufacturing of authorized products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the EMA’s GMP requirements and comparable requirements of other regulatory bodies in the European Union, which mandate the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. Finally, the marketing and promotion of authorized products, including industry‑sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended. Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan drug by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life‑threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (2) a life‑threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
 An orphan drug designation provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory assistance, and the possibility to apply for a centralized European Union marketing authorization. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten‑year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA nor the European Commission or the member states can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a “similar medicinal product.” A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation because, for example, the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the United Kingdom provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the EU Treaty. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom. covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom.
 Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may seek regulatory approval by the FDA or other government authorities. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third‑party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use any product candidates we may develop unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a 

 
 
 50

 
significant portion of the cost of such product candidates. Even if any product candidates we may develop are approved, sales of such product candidates will depend, in part, on the extent to which third‑party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers, and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such product candidates. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third‑party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third‑party payor not to cover any product candidates we may develop could reduce physician utilization of such product candidates once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third‑party reimbursement and coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of pharmaceuticals have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost‑containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost‑containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third‑party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for any product candidates we may develop will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of any product candidates we may develop to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost‑effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessments) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic, and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement 

 
 
 51

 
has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low‑priced and high‑priced member states), can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries.
 Healthcare Law and Regulation
 Healthcare providers and third‑party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third‑party payors, and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti‑kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:
· | the U.S. federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious, or fraudulent or knowingly making, using, or causing to made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”), as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non‑governmental third‑party payors, including private insurers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

 Healthcare Reform
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States.
 By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the PPACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the PPACA of importance to our potential product candidates are:

· | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price” for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for products that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point‑of‑sale‑discount off the negotiated price of applicable products to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient products to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new Patient‑Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the Independent Payment Advisory Board (“IPAB”), which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription products. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. The PPACA provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription product spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the PPACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering

the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was enacted in January 2013, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing.
 Further, since enactment of the PPACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by the President on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, will become effective in 2019. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and premiums in insurance markets may rise. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. The Congress will likely consider other legislation to replace elements of the PPACA, during the next Congressional session.
 The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the PPACA. In January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the PPACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. In October 2017, the President signed a second Executive Order allowing for the use of association health plans and short-term health insurance, which may provide fewer health benefits than the plans sold through the PPACA exchanges. At the same time, the Administration announced that it will discontinue the payment of cost-sharing reduction (“CSR”) payments to insurance companies until Congress approves the appropriation of funds for such CSR payments. The loss of the CSR payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the PPACA. A bipartisan bill to appropriate funds for CSR payments was introduced in the Senate, but the future of that bill is uncertain.
 There have been, and likely will continue to be, additional legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal, and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
