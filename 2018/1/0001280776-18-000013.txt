Item 1. Business.
Overview 
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focusing on the discovery, development and commercialization of cell-based therapies capable of transforming the management of life-threatening conditions. Our initial product candidate, the ELAD® System, or ELAD, is a human-cell-based, bio-artificial liver which is being developed to improve rates of survival among patients with acute forms of liver failure. 
We believe that the ELAD System may improve rates of overall survival and transform the management of acute forms of liver failure. Therapy with ELAD consists of a single, up to five-day treatment session, during which a patient’s blood plasma is passed continuously through four cartridges containing approximately one pound of VTL C3A cells. These cells, which are grown by us from our proprietary cell banks, are human, liver-derived cells, which have been shown to retain a large number of the liver’s synthetic and metabolic functions. During therapy with the ELAD System, we believe that the VTL C3A cells may infuse the patient’s plasma with beneficial proteins, including growth factors, cell survival proteins, and anti-inflammatory proteins, and also remove certain harmful substances, such as endotoxin, all of which may better allow the patient’s own liver to recover and regenerate, thereby potentially improving patient survival. The ELAD System has been granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Commission, for the treatment of patients with acute liver failure, including alcoholic hepatitis.
In May 2016, we commenced our pivotal VTL-308 clinical study. This is a randomized and controlled study comparing the efficacy and safety of the ELAD System plus standard-of-care to standard-of-care alone in adults, under the age of 50 and without secondary organ failure, with liver failure from severe alcoholic hepatitis, or sAH. VTL-308 is designed to enroll at least 150 subjects, and the study’s primary endpoint is a Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival to be performed after the last subject to be enrolled has been followed for at least ninety days. The secondary endpoints are to evaluate the proportion of survivors at study days 28 and 91, as well as the proportion of subjects achieving a certain threshold of bilirubin reduction and surviving without transplant. As of March 12, 2018, 147 subjects have been enrolled in the VTL-308 study, and we expect to announce topline data in the third quarter of 2018. If the data is positive, these results are expected to form the basis for a marketing application to the FDA and other global health regulatory authorities for the approval of the ELAD System for the treatment of sAH. We anticipate performing follow-on studies in other acute forms of liver failure.
Results from a prior study, VTI-208, informed the design of the VTL-308 study and guided its focus on subjects under the age of 50 without secondary organ failure. The VTI-208 study enrolled 203 subjects between 2013 and 2015 with alcohol-induced liver decompensation, most of whom were experiencing liver failure as a result of sAH. In August 2015, we learned that the Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival was not statistically different between groups in the intention-to-treat, or ITT, population. However, in a pre-specified subset of 120 subjects with Model for End-stage Liver Disease, or MELD, scores <28, the Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival did approach statistical significance. A subject’s MELD score is a tool for characterizing the severity of liver disease and degree of secondary organ dysfunction, and also provides a prognosis for survival at 90 days. In another pre-specified exploratory analysis of 101 subjects with less than the median age of 46.9 years, the Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival also favored the ELAD-treated subjects. 
Earlier studies, prior to VTI-208, were primarily designed to identify patient populations and clinical trial designs that were appropriate to pursue in pivotal clinical studies. Two randomized controlled trials (VTI-201 and VTI-206) were conducted primarily in U.S. subjects to help better define the population that would be appropriate for study in pivotal clinical trials. The outcomes of these studies suggested that subjects in whom alcohol was the predominant factor leading to their acute liver failure were a particularly suitable population for study in pivotal clinical trials.
Additionally, a 69-subject randomized, controlled clinical trial (VTIC-301) was performed at two hospital centers in Beijing, China, primarily in subjects with an acute form of liver failure caused by viral hepatitis B. Data showed a statistically significant improvement in transplant-free survival rates in the ELAD-treated group as compared with the control group, while data from a subset comprising the first 49 subjects in this clinical trial revealed a statistically significant difference in overall transplant-free survival. 
In the United States, we estimate that at least 40,000 patients annually experience an acute form of liver failure that may be addressed by the ELAD System. These include liver failure from sAH, post-surgical liver failure, and fulminant hepatic failure. Except for liver transplant, which is severely limited by the availability of organs or not advisable for many patients under current guidelines, the current standard-of-care is primarily focused on the management of complications, which does not restore lost liver function and is associated with a high rate of mortality.
In addition to the ELAD System, we are also exploring the use of proteins produced by our VTL C3A cells to resuscitate donated livers prior to transplantation into patients as there is a need to increase the number and quality of livers available for 
2

transplant. Our pre-clinical research in this field is being done in collaboration with leading research centers in the U.S. and the UK.
We currently retain worldwide rights to the ELAD System free of royalties. If we receive marketing authorization for our products, we intend to establish targeted commercialization and marketing capabilities for our products in the United States and Europe by developing a sales force that would focus on academic medical centers and other centers of excellence treating liver failure. In the United States, for instance, we believe that the approximately 125 active liver transplant centers, as well as a few dozen other specialized liver centers, represent appropriate sites for the placement of the ELAD System. As such, we believe a small, targeted sales force could effectively cover these institutions and successfully commercialize our ELAD System, if approved. We believe a similar sized sales force would be appropriate for Europe. For commercialization of the ELAD System, if approved, outside of the United States and Europe, we may enter into collaborations or license agreements with strategic partners.
We are led by a team of executives and directors with significant experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization. Our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, Russell J. Cox, joined us in January 2018 and has been responsible for developing, launching and selling products in the hospital market for Genentech, Scios Inc. (acquired by Johnson and Johnson in 2003), Tercica (acquired by Ipsen Group) and Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc. Other members of our management team have held senior positions at Baxter, Biogen, Bristol Myers Squibb, IDEC Pharmaceuticals and Medimmune. In addition, our Chairman, Faheem Hasnain, is the former CEO and President of Receptos, Inc., which was acquired by Celgene in 2015. Other members of our Board of Directors currently hold or have held leadership positions with Amgen, BioMarin Pharmaceutical, HeartWare and Medivation. 
Our Strategy 
Our vision is to become a leading global biotechnology company that discovers, develops and commercializes novel therapies capable of extending survival in patients suffering from acute forms of liver failure. We intend to utilize our product development and commercial execution strategies to achieve this vision. Key elements of our execution strategy are as follows:

• | Successfully complete the ELAD System’s clinical development in sAH subjects. For VTL-308, we expect to enroll at least 150 subjects in an event-driven clinical design at approximately 50 sites in the U.S. and Europe, and we expect to report top-line data for VTL-308 in the third quarter of 2018.


• | Obtain regulatory approval for the ELAD System in the U.S. and Europe. If our VTL-308 clinical trial is statistically and clinically successful, we plan to submit a Biologics License Application, or BLA, to the FDA and a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. An additional phase 3 trial may or may not be required for these approvals.


• | Maximize the commercial potential of the ELAD System in the U.S. and Europe. If approved, we intend to directly commercialize the ELAD System in the U.S. and Europe with a targeted sales force focusing on liver transplant centers and other specialist intensive care centers. We believe that we can price the ELAD System in a range consistent with other currently marketed lifesaving therapies, such as left ventricular assist devices, orphan biologic medications for hereditary metabolic diseases and monoclonal antibody medications for cancer.


• | Explore commercial opportunities for the ELAD System in other international markets. We have completed a trial for the ELAD System that may be considered pivotal in China. The study predominantly enrolled subjects with viral hepatitis B, and our application for marketing approval, filed in 2007, is still under review. However, we do not currently anticipate receiving approval in China prior to our receipt of regulatory approval, if any, in the U.S. or Europe. We would expect to address the commercial opportunity in China following approval in the U.S. or Europe. We also plan to evaluate commercial opportunities in Australia, Japan, India, other Asian markets, the Middle East, Brazil and Africa.


• | Pursue development of the ELAD System in therapeutic areas beyond sAH. If the ELAD System is approved for use in patients with sAH, we may pursue the ELAD System’s clinical development in viral hepatitis B, FHF, post-surgical liver failure and bridge-to-transplant.


• | Develop technical improvements and new applications. We plan to continue our development of the ELAD System with the incorporation of technical improvements to our ancillary delivery device, customized disposable sets, and cells. In addition, we plan to explore the development of next generation systems and other uses for VTL C3A cells, such as resuscitation of donated livers.

Our ELAD System Product Candidate
ELAD System
The ELAD System is a phase 3 investigational, extracorporeal human hepatic cell-based liver treatment designed to supplement hepatic function in order to potentially improve survival rates among patients with acute forms of liver failure. The ELAD System consists of four disposable ELAD C3A cell cartridges attached to a reusable ancillary delivery device using customized disposable tubing. The four ELAD cartridges collectively contain approximately eight thousand hollow fibers and approximately one pound of VTL C3A cells from our proprietary cell bank.
The figure below is a schematic of the ELAD System:
During ELAD treatment, an extracorporeal pumping unit draws blood from the subject via a central venous line which then passes into the system to generate ultra-filtrated plasma (ultrafiltrate). The subject’s ultrafiltrate is pumped through the hollow fibers of the cartridge, wherein the semipermeable membrane permits a bidirectional flow between the cells (grown between the exterior of the hollow fibers) and the ultrafiltrate (contained in the lumen of the hollow fibers). Toxins, nutrients and dissolved gases pass from the ultrafiltrate to the cells, while the potentially beneficial macromolecules and other substances synthesized by the cells simultaneously pass into the subject’s ultrafiltrate.
After circulation through the ELAD C3A cell cartridges, the ultrafiltrate passes through a 0.2-µm pore size filter, is recombined with the cellular components of the subject’s blood, and is returned to the subject via the central venous line. VTL C3A cells’ metabolic byproducts are thereby returned to the subject to be utilized or to be excreted by the renal or gastrointestinal system. This circulation can be maintained continuously for the duration of the ELAD treatment for up to five days, as determined by the treating physician. The ELAD System monitors and enables adjustment of glucose and oxygen concentrations in the ultrafiltrate, as well as temperature and other parameters, in order to maintain the viability of the C3A cells.
Our Proprietary VTL C3A Cell Bank
The liver is a complex organ comprising several different cell types to perform the majority of its biochemical functions, with hepatocytes being most widely recognized for their roles in synthesis and metabolism. Hepatocyte viability is limited when cultured or expanded outside the body as they very quickly de-diffferentiate or die. Therefore, normal hepatocytes present practical and logistical obstacles for use in a liver-assist product. Cell lines derived from liver cells can alleviate many of these practical and logistical obstacles. The specific cell line that was selected for the allogeneic ELAD System, the VTL C3A cell line, is a sub-clone of a human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2. The C3A cell line was developed at Baylor College of Medicine and deposited at the American Type Culture Collection. The specific cells stored in our proprietary cell banks and their progeny are referred to as VTL C3A cells. Under the right conditions, VTL C3A cells rapidly proliferate, allowing growth of the large amount of cells necessary to treat the subject with a liver support system, and with cells that remain metabolically active during treatment. Each ELAD treatment uses approximately one pound of cells.

Treatment with the ELAD System is not patient-specific, and our VTL C3A cells, which are derived from a single source, are used to treat all patients. This process is known as allogeneic cellular therapy. In contrast, autologous cellular therapy uses a patient’s own cells, which are manipulated in individual production batches, a costly and complex process. As a result, the production and logistics of treatment with our VTL C3A cells does not face some of the challenges commonly associated with autologous cellular therapies.
The VTL C3A cell bank has been subjected to rigorous safety testing for adventitious agents in accordance with regulatory guidance documents. This bank contains enough cells to enable our clinical development and commercialization. We own this VTL C3A cell bank exclusively and on a royalty-free basis. In addition, we have developed proprietary methods for growing, storing and optimizing the function of these cells.
Our proprietary VTL C3A cell bank is stored in three separate locations around the world for security purposes and is used as the basis for growing the cells needed for each patient at our production facility in San Diego, California.
ELAD Mechanism of Action 
While the mechanism(s) of action for the ELAD System have not been fully elucidated, several potential mechanisms have been modeled during in vitro studies as outlined below. More recently, ongoing work has related these in vitro results to clinical responses. For example, in 25 subjects (14 treated with ELAD and 11 control) from our VTI-208 study meeting VTL-308 criteria, three proteins produced by the VTL C3A cells (IL-1Ra, VEGF-A, sFas), that showed activity during our in vitro models, have also been shown to increase in VTI-208 subject plasma while on ELAD treatment as compared to control subjects. In contrast, other proteins (procalcitonin and ferritin, markers of inflammation and endothelin-1, a marker of endothelial dysfunction) have been shown to decrease in concentration during ELAD treatment as compared to control subjects, suggestive of a pharmacodynamic response to ELAD treatment consistent with the in vitro findings. 
The VTL C3A cells may: 

1. | Provide acute-phase response proteins to help dampen the pro-inflammatory environment and restore the patient’s immune responses. The VTL C3A cells secrete several anti-inflammatory proteins, including alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), the latter of which is upregulated in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines typically found in alcoholic hepatitis patients. Further, VTL C3A cell-secreted factors were shown to reduce levels of pro-inflammatory interleukin 1-beta (IL-1beta) in activated macrophage cultures.


2. | Provide factors which have been shown to prevent hepatocyte and endothelial cell death, through dampening oxidative stress and/or stimulating survival. The VTL C3A cells secrete a number of recognized factors that are involved with regeneration and have been shown, in vitro, to prevent death and promote survival of hepatocytes including soluble Fas receptor and amphiregulin (a recognized potent mitogen during liver regeneration in small-animal models of partial hepatectomy). These factors have also been shown to increase the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione reserves (glutathione being one of the most potent intracellular anti-oxidants). VTL C3A cells secrete a number of proteins involved in angiogenesis such as vascular endothelial growth factor, placental growth factor and angiopoietin, which may be beneficial by improving vascularity in damaged liver sinusoids as well as in other organs. VTL C3A cell-secreted proteins were shown in vitro to prevent cell death in endothelial cells and to reduce intracellular oxidative stress.


3. | Produce blood coagulation factors to address blood clotting imbalances that are common in alcoholic hepatitis patients. Blood coagulation factors, Factor V, Factor VII, Factor VIII, Factor IX, Factor X, Factor XI, Factor XII, Factor XIII, fibrinogen, tissue factor, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, prothrombin, antithrombin III, Protein C, kininogen, prekallikrein, 2-macroglobulin, plasminogen,and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 have been shown to be produced by the VTL C3A cells.


4. | Assist in in the restoration of liver function by providing liver-specific metabolism and detoxification capabilities. The VTL C3A cells express messenger RNA, or mRNA, for cytochrome P450, or CYP, isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, which are collectively responsible for metabolizing nearly 90% of all drugs. Moreover, this CYP expression appears to respond dynamically as evidenced by different expression patterns in VTL C3A cells exposed to different clinical subjects.

While a statistically significant reduction in bilirubin has been demonstrated in subjects over the three to five days of ELAD treatment, because the VTL C3A cells lack the transporters required for unconjugated bilirubin uptake, the metabolistic pathway of bilirubin reduction is not supported through our in vitro studies. However, bilirubin has been shown to be non-specifically sequestered by the VTL C3A cell membranes, which may help contribute to reducing overall bilirubin levels in ELAD-treated subjects.
5

VTL C3A cells have also been shown to express mRNA for bile acid gene targets involved in synthesis, conjugation and transport functions. Bile acid metabolism appears to be moderate in comparison to the cholestatic environment (a condition in which substances normally excreted into bile are retained) of alcoholic patients, based on initial studies; however, total bile acid levels trended lower, decreased more rapidly, and showed enhanced secondary bile acid conjugation over 5 days in a survey of subjects receiving ELAD treatment compared to control subjects.
Further studies are continuing to characterize ELAD's mechanisms of action.
Differentiating Factors of the ELAD System
Unlike other potential therapies developed for acute forms of liver failure in the past, we believe the ELAD System has a unique combination of attributes:

• | Biologically active. The ELAD System contains biologically active VTL C3A cells and is designed to replicate many liver functions. We believe that an acellular solution to liver failure is unlikely to effectively replace lost liver function. We believe that a cellular approach like ours, capable of replicating key biologic processes, is best able to provide the requisite flexibility and breadth of function to sufficiently supplement liver function and improve survival in patients with acute liver failure.


• | Human cellular therapy. The ELAD System is based on human cells, which confer a considerable advantage over non-human, animal-based cell therapies. Given the widespread availability of animal tissues, much work has been done on the use of animal liver cells, often derived from pigs, to treat humans with liver failure. While immunological risk is always present in cellular therapy, the use of non-human animal tissues presents greater immunological risk compared to human cellular therapy. Humans possess naturally occurring antibodies that react with antigens on porcine cell surfaces. These antibodies can mount an immediate attack in the presence of porcine cells, causing these cells to rapidly lose function and die. Moreover, repeated treatments with a porcine cell may cause subsequent immune responses to become increasingly severe. The infusion of porcine enzymes into a patient’s blood stream also poses immunologic risk. We are not aware of any FDA-approved, non-human animal-based cellular therapy for use in patients.


• | Commercially scalable. Our VTL C3A cells used in the ELAD System are immortal and can be expanded in quantities to scale production. Each set of four cartridges used to treat a single patient is grown in a production process that takes up to two months. The process is carefully controlled and is performed under ultra-clean conditions to avoid contamination in our current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, compliant production plant. The process is scalable by modular units.


• | Minimal manipulation needed by site. Prior to shipment, the ELAD cartridges are put into a dormant state and shipped under cool conditions. They have been validated to survive for up to 60 hours before being used for treatment. When the hospital receives the cartridges, they are unpacked by our ELAD System specialists on site, placed on the system, flushed with saline and are ready to be used for patient treatment. Our VTL C3A cells usually remain viable for the duration of the patient treatment.

Liver Failure
The liver performs a wide variety of vital life functions including metabolic, regulatory, detoxification and synthetic activities. The primary liver cell, the hepatocyte, is believed to be responsible for approximately 500 or more specific biologic processes. In addition, the liver also serves as a reservoir for immune cells which clear the blood of pathogens. As a result, the liver’s failure to perform its normal role can have devastating or fatal consequences. Causes of liver failure are numerous, and the condition is typically described in terms of rapidity of onset. The two main categories are acute liver failure and chronic liver failure. In the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis represented the twelfth leading cause of death in 2015. In China, where viral hepatitis is endemic, liver and liver-related disease including liver cancer and hepatitis B represented the fifth leading cause of death in 2014.
Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis (sAH)
Alcoholic hepatitis arises when the cause of the acute liver decompensation appears to be directly related to excessive consumption of alcohol. Severe alcoholic hepatitis, or sAH, is defined as progressive inflammatory liver disease, leading to an acute form of alcohol-induced liver injury that occurs with the consumption of large amounts of alcohol in patients with relatively mild, underlying chronic alcoholic liver disease. 
6

Various degrees of fibrosis and hepatitis are present in sAH patients. Those patients with characteristics of acute alcoholic hepatitis, or AAH, and a Maddrey Discriminant Function (a calculation used to predict the prognosis of alcoholic hepatitis) of ≥32 are deemed to have sAH. Other AAH patients (non-AAH Liver Disease) may have underlying chronic liver disease due to other etiologies, but the cause of their acute decompensation is considered to be related to excessive alcohol consumption. In sAH, there appears to be sufficient hepatocyte mass to allow hepatic regeneration and reversal of the decompensation. It can be discriminated from patients with end-stage liver disease by measurements of liver size using imaging techniques such as ultrasound or CT scan as they tend to present with enlarged livers, rather than with the shrunken livers characteristic of subjects with end-stage liver disease.
Treatment options for patients with sAH are limited. In particular sAH patients with a Maddrey Discriminant Function of >32 have a poor prognosis, with 90-day survival of around 50%. Regimens that have been used for at least the last 40 years, including corticosteroids, theophylline with corticosteroids, pentoxifylline and infliximab, have had no significant effect on the long-term survival of patients with sAH. Steroid use has been associated with an increased rate of infections, a frequent complication of liver failure. Other contraindications to steroid use in patients with sAH include active gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, acute pancreatitis, active tuberculosis, uncontrolled diabetes and psychosis. Subjects who do not respond to seven days of steroid therapy have a particularly dismal prognosis, with six-month survival rates of less than 25%. A major study of more than 1,100 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of sAH demonstrated a reduction in 28-day mortality in subjects administered steroids that did not reach statistical significance, with no improvement in survival at 90 days or one year. This study also revealed no survival benefit at any time point for pentoxifylline relative to placebo. Under current guidelines, transplantation is generally not recommended for subjects with sAH.
The Department of Health and Human Services in the U.S. estimates that for 2014 the number of hospital admissions related to sAH in the U.S. was approximately 102,000, with approximately 15,000 of these admissions identifying sAH as the primary diagnosis. In addition, approximately 323,000 hospital admissions occurred in 2014 related to alcoholic cirrhosis, alcohol liver damage not-otherwise-specified or alcoholic fatty liver, with approximately 50,000 hospital admissions identifying these conditions as the primary diagnosis. We believe that a subset of these patients have a form of non-sAH Liver Disease that may be treatable with the ELAD System. Incidence rates for both sAH and non-sAH Liver Disease appear to be similar in Europe.
Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF)
Hepatocellular damage, secondary to a variety of insults (infectious agents, alcohol, exogenous drugs autoimmunity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis etc.), can result in chronic liver disease, if the underlying etiology is not effectively treated. This condition is characterized histopathologically by increasing degrees of fibrosis and cirrhosis, and frequently remains subclinical or undiagnosed. Often as a result of a secondary insult, the liver can decompensate, leading to a life-threatening disorder known as acute-on-chronic liver failure, or ACLF.
The damage to the liver from continuing insults causes the gradual development of fibrosis in the liver over time, which results in a decrease of both liver function and the ability to regenerate after decompensation. The fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis when this process continues for many years. The progression of fibrosis to cirrhosis results in a shrunken liver, distortion of hepatic lobules, and continued loss of hepatocytes (due to replacement with fibrotic tissue) that leads to progressive and recurrent episodes of decompensation. This progressive loss of hepatocyte mass impairs the liver’s inherent ability to regenerate following decompensation.
Fulminant Hepatic Failure (FHF)
Another form of acute liver failure is fulminant hepatic failure, or FHF, a relatively rare condition characterized by a rapid deterioration of liver function with altered mental state and coagulopathy in individuals without known pre-existing liver disease. The most frequent causes include drug or toxin-induced liver injury, viral hepatitis, autoimmune disease and hypoperfusion. Two thousand cases of FHF are estimated to occur in the U.S. each year. The standard of care includes liver transplantation, and these patients get priority on the liver transplant list although they tend to progress very rapidly and may succumb to their disease before a suitable organ becomes available. We believe the ELAD System may provide these patients with a bridge-to-transplant, or potentially, recovery without transplantation.
Post-Surgical Liver Failure
Another form of acute liver failure can arise following surgical procedures. For example post-surgical liver failure can arise due to:

1. | Primary Graft Non-Function, which occurs when a newly transplanted liver fails to function. This is a life threatening medical emergency, and can lead to death if a new organ does not become available quickly. We believe the ELAD System may provide patients with a bridge-to-transplant until a second liver becomes available.

7


2. | Small-For-Size or Split Liver Transplant occurs when the transplanted liver is functioning, but may be too small to sustain the patient, either because only a small donor liver was available, or because a live person donated a portion of their liver for transplantation. We believe the ELAD System may be able to support the patient’s liver function until the donated organ regenerates to a size large enough to become independent of external support. Moreover, the ELAD System may also enable transplantation of smaller liver fragments than typically used, potentially expanding the available pool of donor organs.


3. | Liver Cancer Resection. Primary liver cancer can sometimes be cured by resecting the cancerous part of the liver after which the remaining liver regenerates to full size. Currently, surgeons will typically only resect up to 50% of the liver in order to avoid death from liver failure. However, more extensive resections occasionally occur, and resection of smaller portions can also lead to liver failure. We believe the ELAD System may be able to support these patients while their liver regenerates and may also enable surgeons to perform larger tumor resections.

We estimate that the first two categories of post-surgical liver failure could account for several hundred patients a year in the U.S. However, it is estimated that there were over 15,000 liver resections performed in 2014 in the U.S.
Chronic Liver Failure
Chronic liver failure refers to a gradual loss of liver function and is usually characterized by the presence of widespread cirrhosis, which refers to the replacement of normal liver tissue by fibrosis, scar tissue and regenerative nodules. As normal liver tissue is destroyed, the organ gradually fails to perform its normal metabolic, regulatory and synthetic functions. Unfortunately, damage from cirrhosis cannot be reversed, and lost liver function can only be regained through transplantation. For this reason, we do not believe that the ELAD System would be effective for cirrhotic patients other than possibly to bridge these patients to transplant.
Limitations of Currently Available Treatment Options for Acute Forms of Liver Failure
Given the liver’s complexity, there are no simple or widely effective medical solutions to acute forms of liver failure. The only long-term cure for acute liver failure is surgical transplantation. As published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, there were 8,082 liver transplants performed in the U.S. in 2017. Also, according to a research report on the 2017 U.S. organ and tissue transplant cost estimates from Milliman, one of the world's largest providers of actuarial and related product services, the average billable charge for a liver transplant in 2017, including the one month before surgery and six months after surgery, was $812,500. There are approximately 14,000 patients currently on the transplant waiting list and approximately 1,200 patients die while waiting each year. Similarly, there are approximately 7,000 liver transplants performed per year in Europe. Outside of transplant, current therapy is defined by the treating facility and is mostly supportive and designed to manage the symptoms and complications associated with acute forms of liver failure.
Pharmaceuticals
N-acetylcysteine is approved by the FDA for the prevention of acute liver injury following the ingestion of toxic amounts of acetaminophen. Other treatments, including steroids and pentoxifylline, are often used off-label to manage symptoms associated with acute forms of liver failure, although steroids in particular have been shown to increase the risk of potentially fatal infections. Results from the Steroids or Pentoxifylline for Alcoholic Hepatitis study, or STOPAH, were presented at the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease, or AASLD, meeting in November 2014. STOPAH enrolled 1,103 subjects with sAH at 65 sites in the U.K., but failed to demonstrate any significant benefit in the primary analysis of overall survival for subjects treated with either steroids, pentoxifylline or a combination of the two at one, three or twelve months, as compared with placebo. In a secondary, multivariate analysis of the data, a small benefit was observed for those subjects taking steroids at one month, although this benefit was not seen in multivariate analyses at either three months or at twelve months. Despite the availability of these treatments, the one-year mortality rate for acute forms of liver failure remains above 50%. We are not aware of any mechanisms for pharmacologically addressing liver failure specifically or restoring lost liver function.
Liver Support Devices
Two commercially available liver dialysis systems, MARS from Baxter (formerly Gambro) and Prometheus from Fresenius, have undergone extensive clinical development. Another company, Hepa Wash GmbH has begun a limited market introduction of an albumin dialysis system in Europe, and HepaNet has introduced the OPAL system, an evolution of the MARS albumin dialysis system in Germany. All rely on not only traditional dialysis circuits to remove water-soluble toxins, but also albumin dialysis circuits to remove albumin-bound molecules. To our knowledge none of these non-cellular systems has shown an improvement in long-term survival among patients with liver failure. It was also recently reported that a team from the Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London and Yaqrit Ltd had initiated a clinical trial in decompensated liver disease for a novel liver dialysis (non-bioartificial) system to be known as YAQ-002 incorporating 
8

albumin dialysis along with selective adsorption technology. There are also reports of a human cell-based system under development in China, but the clinical status of this program has not been confirmed.

The ELAD System’s Clinical Development in sAH
VTI-208
In August 2015, we announced that the VTI-208 clinical trial did not achieve its primary endpoint of overall survival through study day 91. In the extended follow-up of the VTI-208 subjects, referred to as VTI-208E, we have an additional twenty-nine months of survival data as of December 31, 2017. The year end 2017 survival data continues to support the August 2015 conclusions (N=203; Kaplan Meier: p-value 0.859, hazard ratio 1.031).

Seventy-two subjects remained in the VTI-208E extension study at December 31, 2017 and are being monitored annually for survival, transplant and cancer for up to five years.
Pre-specified subgroup analyses of overall survival were conducted on medically-pertinent baseline demographic factors to identify the extent of influence these known factors had, if any, on the overall study outcome. These factors had been previously identified as potential influences on outcome based on scientific considerations, including the outcomes of the STOPAH study (Thursz 2015), results from the CLIF-SOFA consortium (Arroyo 2015), and previous ELAD clinical data. Results of these subgroup analyses revealed that overall survival outcomes in the ITT population were substantially influenced by MELD score and, to a lesser degree, age.
The MELD score is a numerical scale, ranging from 6 (less ill) to 40 (gravely ill), developed for use in liver transplant candidates age 12 and older. It gives each person a ‘score’ (number) based on how urgently he or she needs a liver transplant within the next three months. The number is calculated by a formula using three routine lab test results:
- bilirubin, which measures how effectively the liver excretes bile;
- INR (prothrombin time), which measures the liver’s ability to make blood clotting factors; and
- creatinine, which measures kidney function (impaired kidney function is often associated with severe liver disease).
The specific formula is as follows:
MELD = 3.78×ln[serum bilirubin (mg/dL)] + 11.2×ln[INR] + 9.57×ln[serum creatinine (mg/dL)] + 6.43
The MELD score has also been used to assess mortality risk in other types of liver dysfunction, including sAH. For example an sAH patient with a MELD score of 28 is projected to have a 54% chance of dying over a period of 90 days.
The pre-specified subgroup analysis of MELD, evaluated as a dichotomous variable of <28 and ≥28, identified two distinct populations with respect to ELAD treatment outcomes versus the control group: in subjects with lower MELD scores, treatment outcomes favored ELAD, and, in the similar population with higher MELD scores, outcomes shifted in favor of the control group. Data revealed clinically-meaningful differences as shown by p-value and hazard ratio, or HR, favoring ELAD in the primary endpoint of overall survival up to at least study day 91 in a large subset of subjects with MELD scores <28 (N=120; Kaplan Meier at December 31, 2017: p-value=0.101, HR 0.633). This was also observed in the secondary endpoint of proportion of survivors at study day 91 (N=120; survival: ELAD 80.4% versus control 65.2%, Pearson's chi-squared: p-value=0.068). For those subjects with MELD scores ≥28, the opposite outcome was observed in overall survival (N=83; Kaplan Meier at December 31, 2017: p-value=0.139, HR 1.471) and in the secondary endpoint of proportion of survivors at study day 91 (N=83; survival: ELAD 35.6% versus control 55.3%, Pearson's chi-squared: p-value=0.072).

A more granular post-hoc analysis of MELD score parameters as compared to outcome revealed an important directional association between MELD scores and relative overall survival outcomes. These additional pre-specified and post-hoc analyses helped to discriminate the contribution of each of the individual MELD parameters (bilirubin, creatinine, and INR) on these dichotomized outcomes. Results indicate that higher creatinine and INR levels, reflective of kidney injury and coagulopathy, respectively, are the key drivers associated with less favorable ELAD treatment outcomes compared with controls. The reduced tolerance of subjects with evidence of acute kidney injury and coagulopathy appears to be due to an interventional effect of the extracorporeal administration of ELAD. The limits set in VTI-208 to control the impact of extracorporeal treatment on subjects with secondary organ dysfunction, which had been established based on these critical indicators from our prior datasets, have been set lower in VTL-308.
Although less pronounced than the impact of MELD scores on overall survival, subject age was also identified in a pre-specified subgroup analysis as a demographic factor found to influence study outcomes. In subjects with less than the median age of 46.9 years, the Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival favored ELAD (N=101; Kaplan Meier at December 31, 2017: p-value=0.141, HR 0.663). This was also observed in the secondary endpoint of proportion of survivors at study day 91 with ELAD survival of 81.4% versus control survival of 67.2% (Pearson's chi-squared: p-value=0.112). In those subjects with greater than the median age, the opposite outcome was observed in overall survival. This finding is consistent with the liver resection literature indicating that the liver’s capacity for regeneration diminishes with age. This effect appears to be somewhat exacerbated if there is evidence of acute kidney injury or coagulopathy.

VTI-210
The VTI-210 clinical trial was based on a design suggested by the European regulatory authority and sought to only include subjects who had failed conventional therapy. However, the trial was voluntarily discontinued by us after only 18 subjects were enrolled when our August 2015 analysis of the VTI-208 data suggested that the VTI-210 enrollment criteria were unlikely to lead to a successful trial outcome. In particular, within the VTI-208 data set, healthy secondary organ function at baseline appeared to be a critical determinant of positive outcome with ELAD. In contrast, the VTI-210 criteria allowed subjects to be enrolled with severe secondary organ dysfunction.
It is difficult to draw any conclusions from the small sample of subjects enrolled in VTI-210. That said, there were no significant differences in mortality between the ELAD-treated and control groups either at day 28 or day 91, with three deaths in each group at day 28 and one additional death in the ELAD-treated group at day 91. Additional deaths occurred in both groups after 91 days, consistent with the very low survival expectations of patients who have failed conventional therapy. The adverse event profile was consistent with findings in other ELAD studies and typical for subjects treated with extracorporeal therapies.
VTL-308
Based on our pre-specified and post-hoc analyses of VTI-208 subsets, we initiated our new phase 3 clinical trial in sAH, referred to as VTL-308, in early 2016. VTL-308 is a phase 3 randomized, open-label, multicenter, controlled, pivotal study, designed to evaluate the ELAD System in subjects with sAH who meet criteria based on the data from the pre-specified and post-hoc analyses of the VTI-208 clinical trial. 
The key changes from the VTI-208 clinical trial protocol include restrictions on subjects’ age, MELD score and the three components of the MELD score associated with kidney dysfunction (creatinine), blood clotting dysfunction (INR) and liver function (bilirubin). The VTL-308 inclusion criteria have been established to reflect the same study population as that enrolled in a subset of the VTI-208 population with baseline criteria including MELD <30, age <50, INR ≤2.5, creatinine <1.3mg/dL and serum total bilirubin ≥16mg/dL. When we apply the baseline criteria that we are using in the VTL-308 clinical trial to the subjects in the VTI-208 clinical trial on a post-hoc basis, the study would have reached a nominal p-value of <0.01 with respect to overall survival. These VTI-208 analyses provided the rationale for our current VTL-308 phase 3 clinical trial in sAH. 
The Kaplan-Meier graph of this subset in VTI-208 as of December 31, 2017 is shown below. The hazard ratio is maintained below 0.4 and the significant separation between the survival of treated and control patients remains evident. Data from this post-hoc analysis indicated that there remains a statistically significant difference between treated and control subjects in the primary endpoint of overall survival in this population (N=60; Kaplan Meier at December 31, 2017: nominal p-value=0.018, HR 0.391). This was also observed in the secondary endpoint of proportion of survivors at study day 91 (N=60; survival: ELAD 93.1% versus control 61.3%, Pearson's chi-squared: nominal p-value=0.004). It should be noted that there remain relatively few subjects with four-year follow up data. No death was reported in either the treated or control groups during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. As we continue to collect data, the shape of the curves will continue to change as the data mature and more subjects achieve the milestones. While there is no guarantee that VTL-308 will replicate this result, we believe these VTI-208 subset results are a sound basis to proceed with VTL-308.

The sample size for the VTL-308 study was defined by applying these criteria to the analysis of the primary endpoint of overall survival in the ITT population, and assuming: (1) that this prospectively-defined population behaves similarly to this subgroup of the VTI-208 study; (2) the use of a log-rank test (Kaplan Meier) comparing two survival curves with a two-sided significance level of 0.05; (3) exponential survival curves with proportional hazards; (4) uniform accrual with an accrual time of at least 720 days and a minimum follow-up time of 90 days; and (5) a drop-out rate of 10%. Based on these parameters, a sample size for VTL-308 of 75 subjects per each the ELAD-treated and control groups is consistent with power of at least 0.95 with estimated median survival times of 438 and 175 days, respectively.
In November 2015, we received written responses from the FDA to our Type C meeting request on the planned VTL-308 clinical trial. At the FDA's suggestion, we have incorporated an event-driven feature into the trial design consistent with the primary endpoint of overall survival. Under the modified design, enrollment will continue until at least 150 subjects have been enrolled and approximately 55 events are expected to have occurred by data lock, consistent with the event rate seen in the target subpopulation from VTI-208. In early 2018, independent statistical experts evaluated blinded event rate data from the VTL-308 study. These statisticians concluded that the blinded event rate observed in VLT-308 was consistent with the predicted event rate that was modeled in the trial’s original statistical plan. As a result, the statisticians recommended that we retain our original enrollment target of at least 150 subjects in order to achieve the expected number of 55 events.
We expect to enroll subjects at about 50 sites in the United States and Europe. Many of the sites have been selected based on their high enrollment in the VTI-208 trial or their demonstrated capability to enroll these types of subjects. We expect to report top-line data for VTL-308 in the third quarter of 2018. The VTL-308 phase 3 has been designed to demonstrate statistical significance based on the subset results of the VTI-208 trial; however, there can be no assurance that the trial will be successful or that a single trial will be sufficient to support a marketing application in any country.
The ELAD System’s Clinical Development in Acute Flare of Viral Hepatitis
VTIC-301
Between 2006 and 2007, we enrolled 69 subjects with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) in a randomized, controlled open-label trial at two hospitals in Beijing, China. Inclusion criteria focused the trial’s enrollment on subjects anticipated to have a 50% chance of death by 84 days, and the majority of enrolled subjects were experiencing an acute flare of viral hepatitis. The study was designed to enroll 120 subjects but was terminated early by one of the hospital’s ethics committee because, in light of the results discussed below, it would have been unethical to continue to treat control subjects with standard of care alone. Endpoints included survival at 14, 28, 56 and 84 days, as analyzed using a log-rank method.
A significant protocol amendment was enacted after the enrollment of the first 49 subjects, in which inclusion criteria were changed, reducing the severity of disease, and a shorter ELAD System treatment time was recommended. This change in study design resulted in far fewer deaths or transplants in the second subset of 20 ELAD-treated and control subjects. A revised statistical plan was prepared to accommodate these differences in subject populations. Separate analyses were performed on the 49-subject subset and the full 69-subject population, and additional statistical analysis techniques were proposed, such as the use of Wilcoxon rank-sum techniques to analyze continuous variables such as survival time.
13

Analysis of the first 49 subjects (32 subjects randomized to be treated with the ELAD System for three days along with standard of care for the treating institution and 17 subjects randomized to be treated with standard of care alone) revealed the following:

• | significant differences in 28 and 56-day survival using the log-rank test (p=0.015 and 0.026, respectively); (log-rank was not significant at 14 and 84 days, p=0.074 and 0.058, respectively);


• | significant differences in 84-day survival using the Wilcoxon test (HR=0.45; p=0.049); and


• | no unexpected safety issues.

Generally, the serious adverse events reported in this study were reflective of the severity of disease and co-morbidities present in the patient population. There were 16 post-treatment adverse events in eight of the 32 treated subjects that the investigators reported as possibly or probably related to treatment.
These efficacy results are depicted in the below Kaplan-Meier curve:
Kaplan Meier Curve for VTIC-301 Transplant Free Survival up to Study Day 84 
Analysis of all 68 subjects treated (44 subjects randomized to be treated with the ELAD System for one to three days along with standard of care for the treating institution and 25 subjects randomized to be treated with standard of care alone; note one control subject withdrew consent immediately following randomization and is not included in this analysis, so only 24 controls are included for a total of 68 subjects) revealed the following:

• | Significant differences in 28-day survival using the log-rank test (p=0.015);


• | No significant differences in 14, 56 and 84-day survival using the log-rank test; and


• | No unexpected safety issues.

Based on these results, it was concluded that the Wilcoxon test is a more sensitive technique to elucidate differences between groups in the ELAD System clinical trials, and that a more severely diseased population and more extended treatment times should be evaluated in future clinical studies.
One further observation from the 49 subjects in the first part of this study was that the ELAD System can significantly decrease bilirubin levels, an important biomarker of liver function in patients with ACLF. The overall magnitude of the decrease in mean end of treatment total bilirubin in the ELAD group was 25.1% (17.5 to 13.1 mg/dL) compared to an increase in the control group of 36.8% (17.1 to 23.4 mg/dL). Serum sodium, another biomarker associated with survival in subjects with ACLF, also was significantly improved in the subjects treated with the ELAD System relative to control subjects.
These China pivotal trial data formed the basis of a submission for marketing approval to the China FDA, or CFDA, in September 2007. It should also be noted that this study was not designed, and will not be used, as a pivotal trial to support approval of the ELAD System in the U.S. and Europe.
Subsequent to the completion of the VTIC-301 clinical study, an additional protocol was prepared by the treating physicians to explore the long-term survival of subjects enrolled in this study. Following the grant of informed consent, subjects enrolled in VTIC-301 were contacted and invited to return to the treating hospital for examination for recurrence of liver disease or the incidence of cancer. This study was carried out in 23 and 22 subjects, respectively, three and five years following initial randomization.
14

These data from the first 49 subjects suggest that the survival benefit (statistically significant at three years and five years, Kaplan Meier: p<0.05, log-rank) afforded to those subjects treated with the ELAD System is maintained over a three and five-year period relative to those subjects in the control group. These trends are depicted in the Kaplan-Meier curves below:
While these follow-up analyses were not prospectively defined in the VTIC-301 protocol, we believe they provide valuable information on the long-term survival of this group of patients.
The results of VTIC-301 were submitted to the CFDA for marketing approval in September 2007. However, a regulation enacted in 2009 prevents the approval of novel foreign medical products until they are approved in their home markets first. Accordingly, we would not expect activity or approval by the regulatory authorities in China unless and until we have approval in the U.S.
Commercialization Strategy and Organization
Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. If approved, we intend to directly commercialize the ELAD System in the U.S. and Europe with a targeted hospital sales force and to either commercialize directly or utilize a variety of types of collaboration in other markets.
Sales, Marketing and Reimbursement
Following FDA and/or EMA approval, if any, we intend to launch the ELAD System commercially in the U.S. and Europe, respectively. We expect to direct our initial sales and marketing efforts at sites which have participated in our phase 3 clinical trials in the U.S. and Europe. Subsequently, we would expect to gradually expand our focus in the U.S. to approximately 100 liver-transplant centers, as well as to another 100 specialist intensive care centers with a similar penetration in Europe. We expect that our commercial infrastructure would be comprised of a targeted hospital sales force led by several experienced sales management personnel, an internal marketing and medical affairs staff, and a reimbursement support team. We currently intend to focus our initial commercial efforts on the U.S. and European markets, which we believe represent the largest and most readily addressable market opportunities for the ELAD System. In addition, we believe that Australia, China, Japan, India, other Asian markets, the Middle East, Brazil, and Africa represent significant opportunities because of the prevalence of liver disease in these geographies, and we intend to pursue the commercialization of the ELAD System in certain of these markets through collaborations.
15

We expect the ELAD System to be reimbursed as an in-patient drug in the U.S. For patients eligible for Medicare, who we anticipate to constitute a minority of the ELAD System-addressable patients, reimbursement to the hospital is expected to occur under a diagnosis related group, which may be eligible for a New Technology Add-on Payment and outlier payments. We have begun the process to request appropriate codes and groupings for the ELAD System therapy from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which may take several years to complete, if successful. We have been notified by the American Medical Association, or AMA, that a temporary, or Category III, Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code for physician care oversight of an extra-corporeal liver system was accepted in February 2015, and which became effective on January 1, 2016. However, implementation of a permanent, or Category I, CPT code with a predetermined physician payment value is a lengthy process and is not expected to be complete until several years after potential marketing approval in the U.S. We also expect to work with private payors to develop appropriate case-rates for the ELAD System reimbursement in the U.S. We believe we will ultimately be able to price the ELAD System in a range consistent with other currently marketed life-saving therapies, such as left ventricular assist devices, orphan biologic medications for hereditary metabolic diseases, and monoclonal antibody medications for cancer.
Manufacturing and Supply
Our manufacturing facility is licensed as a drug and medical device manufacturer by the California Food and Drug Bureau. This facility was remodeled in 2014 in order to expand manufacturing capacity to support worldwide clinical trials and early marketing demands for the ELAD System. We intend to make additional modifications that we expect to complete prior to a preapproval inspection, if any.
At our facility, we manufacture the ELAD System, which is comprised of our proprietary VTL C3A cells, cartridges and the bedside unit. The system contains both reusable and disposable medical device components. We source certain components of the ELAD System from third-party suppliers. Most components of our ELAD System are FDA-cleared and CE marked. In a few cases, we manufacture a device or a device component ourselves. Based on discussions with the regulatory authorities, we have determined that all components will have to be submitted for approval for use with the ELAD System as part of the BLA.
All biopharmaceutical production activities must be conducted under cGMP, the standards established by the FDA for pharmaceutical and biologics production. Medical devices must be manufactured in accordance with pertinent device regulations. The equipment used in the manufacturing process is based on designs typically encountered in the production of other biotechnology products and has been customized to tailor their use to the ELAD System production. The ELAD cartridges and bedside units are tested according to the FDA’s and other applicable regulatory bodies’ standards before they can be released for use in humans. All device components shipped from us to our investigational sites are subject to quality control inspection.
Training and Support
We also expect to deploy a training and support team at the liver transplant and specialist intensive care centers that our sales and marketing team are expected to target. During the initial commercialization period, it will be essential for us to have our own trained staff present during the delivery of the ELAD System therapy. This may entail the construction and operation of training centers and will require the hiring of personnel capable of being adequately trained.
Future Commercialization Opportunity
The VTL C3A cells which we grow in our facility produce large quantities of proteins and other cell products, such as albumin, alpha-fetoprotein, alpha-1 antichymotrypsin, alpha-1 antitrypsin, C3 complement, anti-thrombin 3, Factor V, Factor VII, fibrinogen, and transferrin. For example, we are exploring the use of proteins produced by our VTL C3A cells to resuscitate donated livers prior to transplantation in patients. In addition, many of these compounds have known or potential industrial and/or therapeutic applications. We have been exploring the potential commercialization of proteins and other C3A-produced compounds. However, to date, we have not yet identified any feasible opportunities.

Intellectual Property
We have a patent portfolio and substantial know-how relating to the ELAD System. Our patent portfolio includes patents with claims directed to our ELAD System, specific clonal cells and cell-lines derived from human liver-derived C3A cells, as well as methods of growing such cells. We are currently the owner of record of four issued U.S. patents and over a dozen issued or allowed foreign patents. Additionally, we are the owner of record of two pending Patent Corporation Treaty international applications and three pending U.S. patent applications, as well as numerous corresponding pending foreign applications. One granted U.S. patent claims a method of using C3A cells to treat a patient’s blood. The patent has a term that extends to 2027 and may possibly be extended further if the patent is determined to be eligible for patent term extension. Additionally, a second granted U.S. patent includes claims to an extracorporeal device configuration which is cell type independent and which we believe encompasses our ELAD System. The patent has a term that extends to 2025 and may possibly be extended further if the patent is determined to be eligible for patent term extension. Foreign counterparts of these patents have been issued in countries throughout the world, including, for example, in Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines. Furthermore, related applications remain pending in certain other jurisdictions including, for example, Europe, Brazil, Hong Kong and India.
We strive to protect the proprietary technology that underlies the ELAD System. We seek patent protection in the U.S. and internationally for the ELAD System, its methods of use and processes of manufacture, and any other technology to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
A predecessor company initially developed the ELAD System after the technology was spun out of Baylor College of Medicine in 1990. In 2003, we acquired substantially all of the assets of the predecessor, including trade secrets, know how, clinical experience and key employees and facilities.
Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, the validity and enforceability of our patents, and the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets as well as on our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also expect to rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional priority application. In the U.S., a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
The term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved biologic may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the biologic is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved biologic may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of our BLA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions.
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our proprietary technology are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. This includes our methods of expanding, culturing and optimizing the performance of the human VTL C3A cell line.
17

Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
We seek trademark protection in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. where available and when appropriate. We have registered trademark rights for Vital Therapies in the U.S. and Australia and for ELAD in the U.S., Europe and Australia.
Competitive Environment
The biotherapeutic and medical device industries are highly competitive, and we face potential competition from pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies worldwide. Given the significant unmet medical need for novel therapies to treat liver failure, many companies, universities and research organizations are actively engaged in the discovery, research and development of potential therapies in this field. This includes entities engaged in research on cell-based approaches to liver failure.
There are reports of a human cell-based system under development in China, but the clinical status of this program has not been confirmed. Additionally, a number of companies have performed research work on various human hepatocyte cell lines, and several academic researchers and companies are actively pursuing animal research in this area. Companies have also attempted to develop extracorporeal therapy based upon primary porcine hepatocytes and may be in early stage clinical studies with pig-cell based systems designed for the treatment of liver failure. Other than noted above, we are not aware of other entities being close to undergoing human clinical trials with a human cell-based product for the treatment of liver failure; however, it is possible that these trials are occurring without our knowledge, and that such a product may get to market much faster than we expect.
Liver dialysis systems are commercially available in the U.S. and Europe, and further development of albumin dialysis systems is ongoing. These systems rely on not only traditional dialysis circuits to remove water-soluble toxins, but also albumin dialysis circuits to remove albumin-bound molecules. To our knowledge none of these non-cellular systems has shown an improvement in long-term survival among patients with liver failure. It has also been reported that a clinical trial in decompensated liver disease for a novel liver dialysis (non-bioartificial) system incorporating albumin dialysis along with a selective adsorption technology has been initiated. 
In addition, there are several drugs available to treat symptoms associated with liver failure, including steroids, pentoxifylline and N-acetylcysteine. These three drugs, alone or in combination, are used frequently in patients with liver failure resulting from acute hepatocellular insult. Gilead Sciences has initiated a phase 2 trial to evaluate the safety of a non-cellular, drug therapy known as GS-4997 in combination with a steroid named prednisolone, compared with prednisolone alone, in subjects with severe alcoholic hepatitis.
Government Regulation
We operate in a highly-regulated industry that is subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign regulation. Our present and future business has been, and will continue to be, subject to a variety of laws including, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, among others. Biologics and medical devices are subject to regulation under the PHS Act and FDC Act.

The FDA has specified a definition for the term “combination product,” which includes: (1) a product comprised of two or more regulated components, i.e., drug/device, biologic/device, drug/biologic, or drug/device/biologic, that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; (2) two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; (3) a drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or (4) any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.
The FDA is divided into various “Centers” by product type. Different Centers typically review drug, biologic, or device applications. In order to review an application for a combination product, the FDA must decide which Center should be responsible for the review. FDA regulations require that the FDA determine the combination product’s primary mode of action, or PMOA, which is the single mode of a combination product that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. The Center that regulates that portion of the product that generates the PMOA becomes the lead evaluator. If there are two independent modes of action, neither of which is subordinate to the other, the FDA makes a determination as to which Center to assign the product based on consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions or to the Center with the most expertise in evaluating the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product. When evaluating an application, a lead Center may consult other Centers but still retain complete reviewing authority, or it may collaborate with another Center, by which the Center assigns review of a specific section of the application to another Center, delegating its review authority for that section. Typically, the FDA requires a single marketing application submitted to the Center selected to be the lead evaluator, although the agency has the discretion to require separate applications to more than one Center. One reason to submit multiple evaluations is if the applicant wishes to receive some benefit that accrues only from approval under a particular type of application, like new drug product exclusivity. If multiple applications are submitted, each may be evaluated by a different lead Center.
The ELAD System is regulated as a combination biologic/device in the U.S. Based upon the proposed mechanism of action, the primary Center within the FDA responsible for its regulation is the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER. The CBER office responsible for review is the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies, and the marketing application will be a BLA. CBER will consult with the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, in reviewing the device components of the ELAD System.
FDA Approval Process
In the U.S., pharmaceutical and biological products and medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FDC Act, PHS Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of these products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending license applications, warning and other letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
Preclinical Studies
Biological product development in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an investigational new drug application, or IND, along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has not objected to the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
19

Clinical Studies
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational biologic to healthy volunteers or subjects with the targeted indication, or disease, under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations and good clinical practices, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors, as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The clinical trial protocol, protocol amendments and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of investigational products are required to register on clinicaltrials.gov, a National Institute of Health website registry database, and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Marketing Approval
Clinical trials to support BLAs, which are applications for marketing approval, are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In phase 1, the initial introduction of the investigational biologic candidate into healthy human subjects, the investigational biologic is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited subject population, to determine the effectiveness of the investigational biologic for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and identify common adverse effects and safety risks. In the case of product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases such as cancer, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients rather than in healthy volunteers.
If an investigational biologic demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in phase 2 evaluations, phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide adequate information for its labeling. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the biologic for use in a specific indication or population. A single phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multi-center trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. The submission of most BLAs is subject to a substantial application fee and the manufacturer or sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most such applications for standard review biologics products are reviewed within twelve months of submission; most applications for priority review biologics are reviewed within eight months of submission. Priority review for biologics is limited to those products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease with unmet medical need relative to the currently approved products. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
20

The FDA may also refer applications for novel biologics products or biologics products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the BLA unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, is satisfactory, including compliance with applicable parts of the medical device Quality System Regulation, or QSR, as defined for combination products, and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe, pure and potent in the indication studied. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with the FDA’s general biological product standards.
After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, including additional large-scale clinical testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing and distribution of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions, which can materially affect the product’s potential market and profitability. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems or safety issues are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, device components or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet.
Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as phase 4 testing, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as product manufacturing, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMP’s after approval. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with applicable regulations such as cGMPs and the QSR. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP’s. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
21

Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products
Biosimilar Exclusivity
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical study, absent a waiver. A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation.
A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) eighteen months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
21st Century Cures Act
In December 2016, President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, into law. The Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act revises the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to streamline review of combination product applications and authorizes the FDA to designate a drug as a “regenerative advanced therapy,” thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Privacy and Transparency Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of federal and state laws in the U.S. have been applied to restrict certain business operations and activities in the biopharmaceutical and medical device industries in recent years. These laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:
22

The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return, for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, service or item for which payment is made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for a statutory exception or a regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Recently, the civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Medicaid Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper promotion of drugs or off-label uses not expressly approved by the FDA in a drug’s label, and misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered or items provided. The federal criminal false claims law prohibits, among other things, at any time knowingly and willingly making, or causing to be made, any false statement or representation of a material fact for use in determining rights to a benefit or payment under a federal healthcare program.
Many states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal fraud and abuse laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor (e.g. private payors). Sanctions under federal, and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws may include, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare program, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations.
Additionally, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes and regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, private payors. In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.
The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Moreover, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened many of these laws. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the ACA), among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities may not satisfy the statutory exceptions or regulatory safe harbors and we could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. State law equivalents to these federal laws may also apply. Such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
23

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act provisions implemented in final regulation requires applicable manufacturers to report annually to CMS certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to report such data to CMS by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. Other state laws require pharmaceutical companies to adopt and or disclose specific compliance policies to regulate the Company’s interactions with healthcare professionals. Moreover, some states, such as Minnesota and Vermont, also impose an outright ban on certain gifts to physicians.
Violations of some of these laws may result in substantial fines. These laws affect promotional activities by limiting the kinds of interactions we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers or users of our products. Both the disclosure laws and gift bans will impose additional administrative and compliance burdens on us once and if we receive marketing approval of our product. Although we seek to structure our interactions in compliance with all applicable requirements, these laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how a law will be applied in specific circumstances. If an employee were to offer an inappropriate gift to a customer, we could be subject to a claim under an applicable state law. Similarly, if we fail to comply with a reporting requirement, we could be subject to penalties under applicable federal or state laws including, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. In addition to the federal and state disclosure and gift ban laws, certain countries outside of the U.S. have similarly enacted disclosure laws for which the company in its activities may be subjected to from time to time.
Regulation in the European Union
Biologics and medical devices are subject to extensive regulation outside of the U.S. In the European Union, for instance, a centralized approval procedure, or Centralized Procedures, may be used to authorize the marketing of a product in all countries of the European Union, which includes most major European markets. However, for certain products, if this procedure is not used, approval in one country of the European Union can be used to obtain approval in a second country of the European Union under two simplified application processes, either the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure. Both of these procedures rely on the principle of mutual recognition. In addition to regulatory approval, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required in most countries.
In Europe, the ELAD System is regulated as a Combination Somatic Cell Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product, or ATMP. The primary regulatory license application in Europe (a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA), if any, will be made to The Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, and the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, which are the committees at the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, that are responsible for assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of ATMPs. Marketing Authorization Applications for ATMPs can only be filed using the Centralized Procedure. The CHMP and the CAT liaise closely together so the CHMP is able to make a scientific opinion relating to the authorization to place an ATMP on the market in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 and pharmacovigilance. The CAT has also established collaborations with Notified Bodies, or NBs, in Europe in order to review the device components of combination device products, and we anticipate that the device components of our submission would be reviewed by one of those NBs. Currently, during the clinical trial phase in Europe, we are granted authorization to conduct clinical studies at the national level through the health authority agencies in each country, each of which has its own format and regulation for the issuance of clinical trial authorizations, or CTAs. For some countries, it is necessary to obtain separate authorizations in each country for each clinical trial protocol from the medicines and device agencies as there is yet to be developed a procedure for dealing with combination products like the ELAD System. The EMA has provisions for providing companies with advice on topics related to marketing authorization in Europe through the Scientific Advice Working Party, or SAWP. Previously, we sought and obtained advice on the ELAD development program through the SAWP process. We anticipate obtaining further guidance and advice through future interactions with the SAWP.
In other jurisdictions we anticipate that there will be different requirements for authorization for clinical trials and ultimately marketing of the ELAD System due to the complex nature of the combination of biological and device components of our ELAD System.
24

Other Regulations
We are also subject to numerous, federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, fire hazard control, environmental protection and the disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous substances and biological materials. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and their related regulations now or in the future. In addition, we are also subject to laws and regulations in foreign countries outside of the U.S. and Europe where we may seek to commercialize the ELAD System. In certain cases, these foreign laws and regulations may change at inopportune times and prevent the ELAD System’s timely commercialization. For example, several years after we submitted our 2007 regulatory package in China, we were notified of a then newly-enacted 2009 regulation which prohibits the ELAD System’s approval in China until it is first approved in the U.S. As such, we now do not expect regulatory consideration of approval in China until after approvals are received in the U.S. or Europe.
