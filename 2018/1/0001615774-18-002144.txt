ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Forward Looking Statements
 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”) contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.
 
Forward looking statements are made based on management’s beliefs, estimates and opinions on the date the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements if these beliefs, estimates and opinions or other circumstances should change. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.
 
The safe harbors of forward-looking statements provided by Section 21E of the Exchange Act are unavailable to issuers of penny stock. As we issued securities at a price below $5.00 per share, our shares are considered penny stock and such safe harbors set forth under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 are unavailable to us.
 
Our financial statements are stated in United States dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.
 
In this annual report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to “common stock” refer to the common shares in our capital stock.
 
As used in this Annual Report, the terms “we,” “us,” “Company,” “our” and “Zev Ventures, Inc.” mean Zev Ventures, Inc., unless otherwise indicated.
 
THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS AS A GOING CONCERN.
 
In their audit report dated March 27, 2017 our auditors have expressed an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business. Because our officers may be unwilling or unable to loan or advance any additional capital to us, we believe that if we do not raise additional capital, we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plan. See the Audited Financial Statements - Auditors Report”. Because our auditor has issued an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as a going concern, it may be more difficult to attract investors.

Corporate Information
 
Zev Ventures, Inc. (“Zev Ventures, Inc.” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 22, 2014, and our fiscal year end is December 31. The Company’s administrative address is 500C Grand St. Apartment 3G New York NY, 10002. Our telephone number is (631) 418-7044.
 
Zev Ventures, Inc. has begun generating revenues and continues to grow our inventory, however, our ability to fully implement our business plan requires us to raise additional funds for marketing and inventory.
 
Zev Ventures, Inc. has never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceeding. The Company, its directors, officers, affiliates and promoters, have not and do not intend to enter into negotiations or discussions with representatives or owners of any other businesses or companies regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger.
 
The Company purchases sporting events and concert tickets in bulk directly from ticket vendors such as Ticketmaster and directly from the sports franchises and sports associations. The Company intends to focus on tickets offered by the following sports leagues: Major League Baseball (“MLB”), the National Basketball Association (“NBA”), the National Hockey League (“NHL”), and the National Football League (“NFL”). Teams in these leagues sell their tickets for below market price in order to insure games are sold out and to maintain customer loyalty. We intend to capitalize on this market inefficiency by reselling tickets purchased from primary vendors at the price actually commanded by the market on StubHub, a ticket resale marketplace.
 
Buying tickets on the primary market in bulk and months in advance of a given sporting event will permit us to resell those tickets on the secondary market at a 5-20% markup. For tickets to events in unusually high demand, such as playoff games or late-season games with potential playoff implications, the markup can be as high as 30-100%.
 
Our ability to profit on the resale of tickets depends highly on an event’s ability to sell out. Sold out events eliminate primary market vendors from our competition and decrease the supply of tickets, thus increasing our profits. Our ability to see real growth requires additional funding to ensure we have the ability to buy as many tickets as possible. If we focus on simply one team, we will not be able to ensure at least some playoff tickets.
 
Products
 
The Company purchases online tickets to sporting events that are held as inventory. Inventories are presented at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are expensed through cost of sales when sold. The company plans to utilize the specific identification method of accounting for inventory since each ticket is identifiable by a unique ticket number and is easy to track from purchase up to sale. As at December 31, 2017 the Company had $4,068 in inventories.
Competition
 
Barrier to entry in the industry is extremely low and there are many competitors. Since we’ve launched our website for the purpose of selling our tickets, our primary competition will be other ticket resellers on StubHub, Ticketliquidator.com, Ticketnetwork.com, Ticketsnow.com, and Vividseats.com. 
 
For events that fail to sell out, we also compete with primary ticket vendors, such as TicketMaster.
 
As a small company compared to some of our competitors, they have significantly greater financial and marketing resources. They may have a greater advantage to negotiate higher commissions because of their more recognizable brand. There are no assurances that our efforts to compete in the marketplace will be successful.
 
Employees
 
Zev Ventures, Inc. has no employees. Our officer and director is donating his time to the development of the company, and intends to do whatever work is necessary in order to bring us to the point of greater revenues. We have no other employees, and do not foresee hiring any additional employees in the near future. Our officer and director will also be responsible for designing and developing our website and auction system, and managing our Internet Marketing efforts.
Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks
 
There are no aspects of our business plan that require a patent, trademark, or product license.
