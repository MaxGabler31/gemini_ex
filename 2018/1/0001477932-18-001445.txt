ITEM 1. BUSINESS HISTORY AND OVERVIEW
 
CURE Pharmaceutical Holding Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 15, 2014. The Company was formerly named Makkanotti Group Corp. which was formed to engage in the business of manufacturing food paper bags in Nicosia, Cyprus.
 
On November 7, 2016, the board of directors and the majority stockholder of the then outstanding shares of registrant’s common stock executed a written consent to change registrant’s name from Makkanotti Group Corp. to CURE Pharmaceutical Holding Corp. The Certificate of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation was filed with the State of Nevada on November 30, 2016.
 
Further, on November 7, 2016, the registrant, in a reverse take-over transaction, acquired a specialty pharmaceutical and bioscience company based in California that specializes in drug delivery technologies, by executing a Share Exchange Agreement and Conversion Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) by and among the registrant and a holder of a majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the registrant prior to the closing (the “Majority Stockholder”), on the one hand, and CURE Pharmaceutical Corporation, a California corporation (“CURE Pharmaceutical”), all of the shareholders of CURE Pharmaceutical’s issued and outstanding share capital (the “CURE Pharm Shareholders”) and the holders of certain convertible promissory notes of CURE Pharmaceutical (“CURE Pharm Noteholders”), on the other hand. Hereinafter, this share exchange transaction is described as the “Share Exchange.”
 
The following is a brief description of the terms and conditions of the Exchange Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder that are material to the registrant:
 
 
· | Share Exchange and Share Cancellations. The registrant shall issue 9,010,000 restricted shares of its common stock, $0.001 par value per share (“Common Stock”), to the CURE Pharm Shareholders in the aggregate, in exchange for 2,718,253 shares of CURE Pharmaceutical’s common stock held by them, representing 100% of the then issued and outstanding common stock of CURE Pharmaceutical (the “Share Exchange”). In connection with the Share Exchange, the Majority Stockholder agreed to cancel 16,181,400 shares of Common Stock of the registrant in exchange for a warrant (the “Majority Stockholder Warrant”) to purchase up to 1,640,305 shares of Common Stock of the registrant at an exercise price of $2.00 per share and with an exercise period of four years commencing on the date of issuance of the warrant. In addition, one other shareholder of the registrant entered into a share cancellation agreement with the registrant whereby such shareholder agreed to cancel 652,390 shares of the registrant’s common stock at the closing of the Share Exchange in order to induce CURE Pharmaceutical to enter into the Exchange Agreement.

· | Conversion. The registrant issued 6,106,463 restricted shares of Common Stock to the CURE Pharm Noteholders in the aggregate, by converting the convertible promissory notes of CURE Pharmaceutical held by the CURE Pharm Noteholders in the aggregate principal amount of $6,106,463, at a conversion price of $1.00 per share. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Change in Management. Michael Hlavsa, the registrant’s sole director and executive officer immediately prior to the closing of the Exchange Agreement, resigned, and Robert Davidson, William Yuan and Charles Berman were appointed to the registrant’s board of directors (the “Board”). Robert Davidson, Edward Maliski, Wayne Nasby and Mark Udell were appointed as the new chief executive officer, president and chief scientific officer, chief operating officer, and chief financial officer and secretary, respectively, effective at the closing of the Exchange Agreement. Additional information regarding the above-mentioned directors and executive officers is set forth below in Item 2.01 and Item 5.02.

 
As a result of the Share Exchange, CURE Pharmaceutical became a wholly owned subsidiary of the registrant, and the CURE Pharm Shareholders and CURE Pharm Noteholders became the controlling shareholders of the registrant.
 
The closing of the transactions contemplated under the Exchange Agreement (the “Closing”) took place on November 7, 2016 (the “Closing Date”). As a result, the registrant had a total of 23,266,733 shares of common stock issued and outstanding at the Closing Date, with the CURE Pharm Shareholders and Noteholders collectively owning approximately 64.97% of the registrant’s issued and outstanding Common Stock.
 
CURE Pharmaceutical Corporation
 
Our wholly owned subsidiary and operating business, CURE Pharmaceutical, located in Oxnard, California was originally incorporated in July 2011 to develop novel drug formulation and delivery technologies. 
 
The pharmaceutical industry is facing ever-growing R&D expenditure and fewer new drug approvals as a result of increasing regulation, a failure to predict safety problems or a lack of efficacy early in a drug’s development, and high investment in new technologies to improve the speed and accuracy of drug development. In addition to these challenges to the industry’s operators, many leading drugs are coming off-patent, creating a need to fill revenue gaps. The pharmaceutical industry is also challenged by the many patients who do not adhere to a regime of prescription drugs because of side effects, difficulty in administration or the taste of a drug. According to HealthPrize and Capgemini, the loss of global revenues by drug makers due to non-adherence to medicines is $630 billion every year. 
 
Improved formulations can address these many challenges by cutting down development costs, reducing the time to market, extending product patent protection, improving patient compliance and increasing drug efficacy. For example, reformulation can enable drug repositioning, the process of finding new uses for failed drugs, such as those abandoned for lack of efficacy after Phase II trials, or marketed drugs for which new uses will extend patent life and, therefore, profitability. 
 
The FDA approves more reformulations than new chemical entities (NCEs) each year under Section (505)(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (“505(b)(2)”) the FDA. The number of 2017 NDA approvals that used the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway rose dramatically from 45 approvals in each of the last two years to an all-time high of 63 in 2017. Under Section (505)(b)(2), the FDA may grant market exclusivity for a term of up to three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage, dosage form, route of administration or indication for use. Taken together, the exclusivity period of a drug and the lower R&D cost for reformulating a drug, have led to pharmaceutical companies taking a keen interest in reformulating their drugs as part of their lifecycle management protocols.
 
The veterinary industry, which is under pressure to acquire new products and revenue streams, will benefit from similar formulation-focused commercial strategies, addressing a significant need for improved ease of administration by animal caregivers and handlers.

CUREfilmTM Technology
 
The founders of CURE Pharmaceutical are pioneers in drug delivery and oral thin film (OTF), having launched the first therapeutic OTF product, Chloraseptic® relief strips in 2003. OTF products are about the size of a postage stamp and can deliver medicines through the mucosal tissue in the mouth, sublingually or buccally – on the cheek or via the gastrointestinal tract. Oral transmucosal drug delivery is a non-invasive route for drug delivery that allows for absorption directly into the vascularized tissue in the mouth, bypassing the hepatic first pass effect. This leads to reduced drug exposure, and can offer a rapid onset of action. As an OTF, pharmaceutical actives can be either pre-solubilized or encapsulated, or both for more effective GI absorption and/or sustained release. The quick dissolution nature of OTF means that no water is required for administration, improving patient compliance - especially among the elderly, children, and in conditions where patients have difficulty in swallowing. 
 
The CUREfilm platform is a scalable and versatile formulation and drug delivery system for both oral (OTF) and transdermal (skin) delivery. CUREfilm formulations can improve or match the pharmacokinetics of drugs in accordance with the desired outcome. The platform is compatible with a broad spectrum of molecules, for the formulation of both investigational and marketed prescription, OTC and nutraceutical products.
 
The competitive advantages of the CUREfilm platform over other OTF technology are protected by issued and pending patents, as well as trade secrets, and are as follows:
 


1. | A dual layer approach with a liquid-based film layer and a powder matrix layer. The powder composition which may include an active ingredient, can be used to modulate the mucoadhesiveness of the film as well as the dissolution and absorption rates of the medicament. This approach protects the active ingredient from high shear and heat which can degrade the drug. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Micro-encapsulation of drug actives that allows for loading higher amounts of an active ingredient, such that we can deliver lower potency drugs in a single dose. By extension, multiple actives can be loaded onto a single dose. The micro-encapsulation process, envelopes all or part the active ingredients with microscopic particles or droplets to protect and shield them. This technique allows the delivery of higher dosing with better flavor masking, increase stability of the active ingredient as well sustained drug release.
3. | Proprietary equipment design and manufacturing processes, pursued as trade secrets, allow us to produce CUREfilm products at commercial scale in a cGMP environment. 

Business Strategy
 Our commercial strategy is designed to mitigate risk by pursuing a diversified model. 
 

1. | Nutraceuticals. We manufacture select nutraceuticals that complement our portfolio and align with our mission, in partnership with distributors. This approach provides us with short term revenue opportunities. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Pharmaceuticals. We partner with companies that are responsible for clinical development and regulatory approval with the FDA and/or other regulatory bodies, as well as for the marketing and distribution of the products. On a case-by-case basis, we may be responsible for providing all or part of the documentation required for regulatory submissions and for conducting the preclinical testing of our products. Deal terms may include upfront licensing fees, development costs, milestone payments and exclusive manufacturing rights. Within this category, we are further diversifying risk and return by pursuing product life cycle opportunities (e.g. Sildenafil CUREfilm) as well as investigational drugs (e.g. PEA & Dronabinol combination CUREfilm). While we currently manufacture nutraceutical products in our state-of-the-art cGMP oral film manufacturing facility, we are undertaking steps to manufacture pharmaceutical products for commercial use. 
3. | Cannabinoids. We are specifically investing in pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoid products, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). The oral bioavailability of cannabinoids is very low due to extensive “first-pass” metabolism. Consequently, potency and release times are unpredictable and inconsistent. Moreover, cannabinoids don’t readily dissolve in water which adds to dosing difficulties and discrepancies. In addition to improving bioavailability, CUREfilm enables the loading of combinations of cannabinoids and other plant extracts that, together, provide maximum therapeutic benefit. We are investing in preclinical cannabinoid research at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, where the laboratory of Dr. Dedi Meiri is identifying specific combinations of cannabinoids with anti-tumor effects. We are undertaking steps to research scheduled drugs at our Oxnard facility. 
4. | Underserved patient populations. Consistent with our mission of improving the lives of all people in need, regardless of geography or economic status, we have made our technology available to a private company, Oak Therapeutics (“Oak”), that is developing novel drug formulations for patients in developing nations (“Territory”). On November 10, 2017, we received 269,000 shares of Oak as consideration for an exclusive license to our patents rights in the Territory, along with a royalty-free non-exclusive license to any improvements made by Oak. As a result of this transaction, we own approximately 63% of Oak’s outstanding shares and have consolidated Oak’s financial statements as of the fourth quarter 2017. Oak has completed a Phase I Small Business Innovative Research Contract (“SBIR”) from the National Institutes of Health to develop a formulation for 300mg of Isoniazid in a rapidly dissolving film as an anti-tuberculosis treatment option. Oak is currently in the application process for Phase II of the SBIR program to continue its research and development and focus on manufacturing scale up, clinical trials and commercialization.

Competition
 We face competition from other companies, universities, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Many of our competitors, including Monosol, BioDelivery Sciences International, IntelGenx and LTS Lohmann, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Our success will be based in part on our ability to develop and manufacture products that address unmet medical needs and create value to patients at competitive price points. In addition, continuing to build our intellectual property portfolio and designing innovative approaches that surpass our competitors’ patents will be critical to success.
