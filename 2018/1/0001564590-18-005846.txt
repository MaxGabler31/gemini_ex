Item 1. Business 
Overview
 Our vision is digital life for everyday items. We are driving toward a future in which everyday physical items have digital counterparts, digital twins, in the cloud, and in which businesses and people engage with trillions of those everyday physical items via their digital twins. Our mission is to deliver a platform that powers that item-to-cloud connectivity, enabling developers to innovate Internet-of-Things, or IoT, applications on our platform. Today, we deliver the identity, location and authenticity of billions of physical items; our future is enabling those cloud-based digital twins, each storing an individual item’s ownership, history and available services, and enabling ubiquitous access to them. We believe the item-to-cloud connectivity we will deliver will enhance businesses efficiencies and commerce and, ultimately, improve peoples’ lives.
Opportunity
 Our platform connects individual items, capturing and delivering data about each item from manufacturing, through distribution to sale. We envision a future where we extend and deliver an item’s digital life to the person that purchases and owns it. We and our channel partners connect items via a miniature radio chip embedded in the item or in its packaging, reading and delivering the item’s unique identity, location and authenticity to business and consumer applications. To date, we have enabled connectivity to more than 25 billion items, enabling retailers, hospitals, airlines, automotive manufacturers and business in many other industries to derive timely business value from those connected items. Our opportunity is to connect billions, ultimately possibly trillions of everyday items, and to deliver valuable information about these items not just to businesses, but also to people.
 Our platform connects everyday items using RAIN, a radio-frequency identification, or RFID, technology we pioneered. We spearheaded development of the RAIN radio standard, lobbied governments to allocate frequency spectrum and cofounded the RAIN Industry Alliance which today has more than 150 member companies. Today, the RAIN RFID industry uses the RAIN radio standard nearly exclusively, has access to radio spectrum freely available in 78 countries encompassing roughly 96.5% of the world’s GDP and has connected tens of billions of items. We believe RAIN’s unique capabilities – unique identifiers for individual items, battery-free operation, low cost, long range, not line-of-sight, 1,000 reads per second, designed to have essentially unlimited life and available cryptographic item authentication – position RAIN to be the leading item-to-cloud connectivity technology for the IoT.
 RAIN market adoption has historically been slower than anticipated or forecasted by us and industry sources. For additional information related to RAIN market adoption, please see the section of this report captioned “Risk Factors.”
 Impinj Platform
 Our platform comprises software, connectivity, and endpoint integrated circuits, or ICs, that together deliver item data to business applications. We link the layers of our platform to deliver advanced capabilities and performance that surpasses mix-and-match solutions built from competitor products. Within each layer we sell one or more product families.
Software
 Our primary software offering, ItemSense, is a distributed operating system for our platform. ItemSense transforms item-level RAIN data into actionable business information, enabling analytics and insights about items a business manufactures, transports and sells. ItemSense’s key capabilities include enterprise-class RAIN deployment management and health monitoring; software-defined algorithms for item inventory and location determination; and easy-to-use, easy-to-integrate APIs that enable application developers to quickly build powerful IoT solutions on our platform to solve business problems.

Connectivity
 Our connectivity offering comprises a family of readers, gateways and reader ICs that wirelessly identify, locate, authenticate and engage items. Our connectivity products wirelessly provide power to, and communicate bidirectionally with, endpoint ICs on those items, identifying and locating up to 1,000 items per second.
 Readers read, write, authenticate or otherwise engage endpoint ICs on items. Gateways integrate stationary readers with scanning antennas to locate and track items. Our readers and gateways are easy to deploy and use, can be powered via power-over-Ethernet and are certified for operation in more than 40 countries. Our customers have deployed our readers and gateways in applications ranging from retail inventory-taking to automated fuel filling to shipping-container tracking to airport luggage handling.
 Our stationary reader product family, branded Speedway, comprises high-performance finished products. We sell our Speedway readers through an established channel of distributors, system integrators, or SIs, value-added resellers, or VARs, and solution providers. Our readers sell for hundreds of dollars.
 Our gateway product family integrates our Speedway readers with beamforming antennas to electrically steer a radio beam like a searchlight. Their always-on, autonomous operation delivers timely item data without ongoing labor costs. Our portal gateways, branded xPortal and xSpan, scan doorways or hallways such as front-to-back store transitions, entryways and exits. Our array gateway, branded xArray, scans up to 1,500 square feet of floor space such as in a store, manufacturing facility or hospital room. Our gateways sell for thousands of dollars. 
 Our reader ICs and modules, branded Indy, comprises a suite of ICs and modules that combine our reader ICs with peripheral circuitry in an easy-to-use format. We sell our reader ICs and modules to original equipment manufacturing, or OEM, and original design manufacturing, or ODM, partners that use them in a variety of products such as mobile or handheld readers, fixed readers, gateways, and RAIN-enabled appliances. We offer easy-to-use APIs, development environments, sample code, drivers and libraries. We sell our reader ICs and modules for tens of dollars.
 Endpoints ICs
 Our endpoint IC product family, branded Monza, comprises a family of miniature radios-on-a-chip that attach-to and uniquely identify their host items. Monza ICs include a number to identify a host item and may also include features such as user data storage, security, authentication, loss prevention, consumer privacy and value-added Impinj custom features, all accessible by our platform. Our Monza ICs power themselves from a reader’s radio waves so they do not need a battery, can wirelessly connect almost any item and, are readable to 30 feet without line-of-sight, yet they sell for pennies.
 Our OEM partners attach each Monza IC to a thin printed antenna on a paper or Mylar backing, then typically cover the composite inlay with a paper face to form a tag. End customers attach the tag to an item in markets including retail, healthcare, automotive, industrial and manufacturing, consumer experience, food, datacenter, travel and banking. We refer to a tag and its host item as an endpoint. 
 Endpoint ICs differ from traditional silicon ICs in that most endpoint ICs are disposable. For example, when consumers purchase retail items they discard the price tags containing the endpoint ICs. We believe endpoint ICs are the first market for consumable silicon and are a recurring revenue source for us. We have shipped more than 25 billion endpoint
 ICs to date, including approximately 7.1 billion and 6.0 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 Industry Use Cases
 The following use cases are representative of actual RAIN deployments we serve today.
 Retail
 Retailers, both traditional “brick-and-mortar” and online, are consuming billions of tags each year to obtain real-time data about products they manufacture, transport and sell. By using our platform retailers can obtain these benefits:

Our platform delivers accurate and timely data about a retailer’s inventory, delivering visibility into what items a retailer has and where the items are located. Accurate inventory data can minimize process steps, eliminate searching and avoid confusion – allowing staff to focus on customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Omnichannel Operations. Omnichannel retailing is about selling products when, where and how customers want to buy—but retailers can’t sell what they can’t see. The cornerstone of a successful omnichannel operation is real-time inventory visibility that provides accurate item information in stores, distribution and fulfillment centers. With real-time inventory visibility delivered by our platform, omnichannel retailers can efficiently sell inventory distributed across all their retail locations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Store Operations. Accurate inventory data is key to an efficient, optimized retail organization. But many retailers are stuck doing things the old way—manually counting items. And the data are outdated soon after they complete a cycle count. The Impinj platform delivers timely information about items in retail stores and warehouses, enabling retailers to confidently sell down to the last item in stock, know what products are popular, and help customers shop in their stores.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhanced Shopper Experiences. Capturing customer attention as they step foot in a store with seamless interactive item-based experiences helps sell those items. The Impinj platform enables interactive in-store applications such as digital signs, magic mirrors and self-checkout kiosks. These interactive applications grab customers’ attention, provide information during the buying decision and keep shoppers engaged in the store.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Loss Identification and Analytics. The same platform capabilities that give retailers inventory visibility can also improve loss prevention. With the Impinj platform, retailers can be alerted when items enter or leave specific zones within a store. Item identification, location and movement data can help retailers make smart decisions to protect their inventory and avoid lost sales due to missing inventory.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Healthcare
 The healthcare industry continues to focus on patient quality-of-care and operational efficiencies, increasing pressure on hospitals and healthcare providers to obtain real-time data about assets, inventory, staff and patients. By using the Impinj platform, the healthcare industry can obtain these benefits: 

• | Hospital Asset Management. The Impinj platform wirelessly connects information about an asset’s identity and location to the hospital’s enterprise systems, tracking assets as they move through the hospital. This asset visibility allows hospital staff to visualize an item’s location in real-time, improving resource usage, reducing capital expenditures and ensuring compliance with regulated processes.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supply Chain Management. The Impinj platform wirelessly identifies a product’s identity and location in the supply chain, giving healthcare organizations the visibility they need to better manage their assets and consumables and ensure compliance.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Advantages
 We lead the RAIN RFID market in connecting and delivering information about items. We believe we can maintain and extend our leadership position as the market grows by leveraging our competitive strengths, including:

• | Comprehensive Platform. Impinj products provide significant value through advanced features and fuctionality, but end users who deploy the Impinj Platform gain performance, reliability and ease-of-use we believe is unequaled by “mix-and-match” systems cobbled-together from competitors’ components. We believe our success with these end users will drive broader adoption of our platform.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Market Leadership. Our platform is integrated, easy to deploy and use, versatile and applicable to many use cases, and delivers unmatched performance. We believe we are the only company with an integrated RAIN platform, and believe we have leading market share in endpoint ICs, reader ICs and stationary readers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broad Partner Ecosystem. Our worldwide partner ecosystem comprising more than 500 distributors, system integrators, value-added resellers, or VARs, and software solution partners as of December 31, 2017 gives us market reach, penetration and scalability we believe few, if any, of our competitors enjoy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Technology Leadership. Our chief executive officer is a recognized industry thought leader. He is a director of the RAIN Industry Alliance and was editor for the RAIN radio standard. Our intense focus on RAIN has enabled us to be first-to-market with innovative, high-quality products. As of December 31, 2017, our intellectual property portfolio includes 233 issued and allowed U.S. patents, 20 pending U.S. patent applications and two pending international patent applications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Trusted Brand. We believe our industry leadership, name recognition and reputation for innovative, high-performing and quality products have significantly contributed to our leading market position. We believe our brand is unmatched in the industry, helping us sell products and maintain our market leadership.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategies
 To further our mission of connecting everyday items, we plan to focus on the following strategic areas:
  
• | Continue Investing in Our Platform. We have made significant investments and plan to continue investing in platform functionality, software/hardware linkages, broadening our software capabilities, enhancing platform features such as item authentication and loss prevention and reducing costs. We are investing to extend our platform linkages substantially, with our next-generation reader delivering item-authentication features that our operating system will deliver as a cloud service, and our next-generation endpoint IC connecting via our platform to that cloud service. We also plan to enhance our gateway functionalities to help drive gateways as the preferred connectivity devices for retail, healthcare and other industries.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drive End-User Adoption. We plan to deepen our platform integration with software partners and to grow our sales, support and product-development teams. These investments will allow us to expand our engagements with end users in retail, healthcare and other industries and accelerate their adoption of the Impinj Platform. We also intend to broaden our partner ecosystem and expand our solutions focus and offerings. To meet the growing demand for our products, we are expanding inventory and reducing product lead times.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cross-Sell and Up-Sell Our Platform within our Installed Footprint. We believe the majority of RAIN deployments today use one or more of our products, positioning us for future platform cross-sell and up-sell opportunities. For example, retailers that deploy our gateways see improved inventory accuracy when using our endpoint ICs, positioning us to up-sell our platform into these retail accounts.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand within our Existing Customer Base. We will seek additional revenue from existing end users of our platform by expanding their deployment scope and adding new use cases. For example, retailers typically start deploying RAIN by tagging apparel. We see opportunities to expand their tagging to housewares, appliances, cosmetics and eventually all items in a store. These same retailers typically choose inventory visibility as their first use case. We see opportunities to extend their use cases for already-tagged items to omnichannel fulfillment, loss prevention, enhanced retail analytics and more.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enable Ubiquitous Reading. We plan to invest in next-generation reader ICs to improve functionality, reduce costs, and make Impinj-based readers ubiquitous in industrial and consumer devices and facilities infrastructure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing
 Our go-to-market model prioritizes brand development, end-user awareness, lead generation and sales enablement. Our communications use web, electronic and channel programs complemented by press initiatives and industry-analyst relationships. Our solutions-marketing, business-development and solutions-architecture teams work with our partner independent software vendors, or ISVs, to enable joint solutions and joint go-to-market selling.
 We deliver products and solutions that are easy for our partner ecosystem to sell and deploy. We engender preference for our platform in all sales engagements, encouraging end users to deploy our multiple products to gain full benefit from our platform. Our business development, product marketing, technical and systems engineers all actively engage partners and end customers.

Our sales force leverages a global partner ecosystem of distributors, SIs, VARs and ISV partners. Each regional sales team sells all of our products. We organize our sales team primarily by geography: (1) Americas, (2) Asia Pacific and (3) Europe, Middle East and Africa. We also have a small number of worldwide sales executives with expertise in endpoint and reader ICs to support the geographic sales teams. Because our operating-system software is still relatively new to the market, the revenue we derive from software is small, so we currently derive most of our revenue from connectivity product and endpoint IC sales. We sell our products as follows:
  
• | Software through distributors, VARs, system integrators and other software-solution partners.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Readers and gateways primarily to VARs and system integrators through distributors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reader ICs and modules primarily through distribution to reader OEMs and ODMs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Endpoint ICs directly to inlay and tag OEMs and ODMs. We typically negotiate pricing, volumes and deliveries with these OEMs and ODMs yearly, with new pricing effective during the first quarter of the calendar year.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The following table presents total revenue concentrations to Avery Dennison Corporation, or Avery, Smartrac NV, or Smartrac, Arizon RFID Technology (Yangzhou) Co., LTD, or Arizon, Shang Yang RFID Technology Yangzhou Co.

Shang Yang | | 7 | | | 10 | | 15 | 
Blue Star | | 10 | | | 9 | | 10 | 
 | | 62 | % | | 60 | % | 64 | %

 We engage directly with end users in collaboration with partners across our ecosystem, usually fulfilling sales through those same partners. In some instances, these end-customer engagements leverage go-to-market relationships with companies who do not sell our products but whose product offerings complement ours. Many of our partners sell multiple of our products or our entire platform.
 Manufacturing
 We outsource all our product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers that build our products to our design specifications. This capital-efficient operating model scales efficiently with volume, allowing us to focus our resources on accelerating development of new products and solutions.
 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSMC, fabricates our endpoint IC wafers in Asia and the United States and has been our sole endpoint IC wafer supplier since 2003. We order endpoint IC wafers on a purchase-order basis and do not have a long-term agreement with TSMC. We test the wafers at our U.S. headquarters and in Asia. We use multiple subcontractors to post-process the wafers. Our primary subcontractor for our endpoint ICs is Stars Microelectronics (Thailand) Public Company Limited, or Stars. We generally engage all our endpoint IC subcontractors on a purchase-order basis.
 TowerJazz Ltd. fabricates our reader IC wafers in the United States and has been our sole reader IC wafer supplier since 2008. We order reader IC wafers on a purchase-order basis and do not have a long-term agreement with TowerJazz. We use subcontractors on a purchase-order basis to package the ICs and test the packaged parts.
 9

Plexus Corp., or Plexus, manufactures our readers in Asia and has been our sole supplier since 2005. Plexus and Western Corporation in the United States have manufactured our gateways since 2013 and 2010, respectively. We order readers and gateways pursuant to nonexclusive purchase agreements that renew automatically each year, subject to each party’s right to terminate upon 180 days’ notice. We engage subcontractors on a purchase-order basis to assemble and test printed circuit boards, to build our reader and gateway enclosures and test our readers and gateways.
 Research and Development
 We built our company around technology leadership and innovation. We have committed, and plan to continue committing, significant resources to technology and product innovation and development. We achieved our market leadership by innovating, delivering and continuously improving product performance, features, quality and reliability while also reducing costs. In most situations, we strive to lead the market with new innovations, but we sometimes adopt a “fast follower” approach depending on the market situation. As one example, endpoint IC performance typically improves when we migrate the semiconductor processing to more advance process nodes. We execute these node migrations when the development costs, performance improvements, competitive situation and product cost reductions justify the migration. But external factors, such as the ability of our OEM and ODM partners to process larger wafers with smaller ICs can cause us to delay, or even allow our competition to temporarily lead, while we develop competitive products that we introduce when our OEM and ODM partners are ready. 
 We have assembled a team of skilled engineers and currently perform all research and most of our product development internally. As of December 31, 2017, we had 133 employees in research and development, of which 13 hold a Ph.D. and 37 hold a master’s degree. Research and development expenses for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $32.2 million, $25.2 million and $17.6 million, respectively. We regularly review our technology, products, developments and product opportunities and reallocate our spending and resources accordingly.
 Intellectual Property
 We protect our technologies by filing patent applications, retaining trade secrets and defending and enforcing our intellectual-property rights where appropriate. To date, our intellectual property portfolio includes 233 issued and allowed U.S. patents, 20 pending U.S. patent applications and two pending international patent applications. The first of our 175 issued utility patents expire in 2024 and the first of our 26 issued design patents expire in 2021. To protect confidential information not otherwise subject to patent protection, we rely on trade secret law and enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and partners.
 Because most RAIN product SKUs are used in, or imported into, the United States, and because many of our partners and end customers have U.S. operations, we believe U.S. patents hold the most value for our business. Consequently, we have filed primarily U.S. patent applications. We have a small number of pending foreign patent applications but none have yet allowed or issued. Because our portfolio currently contains only U.S. patents, we have limited ability to assert our intellectual-property rights outside the United States.
 Although our patents and trade secrets constitute valuable assets, we do not view any one of them as material. Instead, we believe the totality of our patent and trade-secret portfolio creates an advantage for our business.
 We have entered into licensing, broad-scope cross-licensing and other agreements authorizing us to use or to operate within the scope of patents and intellectual property owned by third parties. For example, we have licenses to third-party intellectual property that we use in our products. As another example, by participating in developing GS1 EPCglobal protocols, such as the RAIN radio protocol, we agreed to license those of our patents necessarily infringed by the practice of these protocols on a royalty-free basis to other GS1 EPCglobal members, subject to reciprocal royalty-free rights from those members. By participating in developing ISO standards, we have agreed to grant to all users worldwide a license to those of our patents necessarily infringed by the practice of several ISO standards, including non-RAIN standards, on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, subject to reciprocity.
 We own a number of trademarks, develop names for our new products and secure trademark protection for them, including domain name registration, in relevant jurisdictions.
 10

Alliances and Standardization
 We, along with Google, Intel and Smartrac, cofounded the RAIN Industry Alliance in 2014. Our chief executive officer is presently an Alliance Director and was previously the Alliance Chairman. The Alliance is a global organization promoting the universal adoption of RAIN technology and solutions with more than 150 members as of the date of this report. The name “RAIN” connotes ubiquity and a close link to cloud data.
 We, our customers, partners and competitors developed the RAIN radio protocol, UHF Gen2 (standardized as ISO/IEC 18000-63) in 2004, with us as the editor. Our community delivered a backwards-compatible update in 2013, again with us as the editor. Our industry uses Gen2 nearly exclusively.
 By participating in GS1 EPCglobal, which produced Gen2, and ISO, which ratified 18000-63, as well as in other standards bodies, we agreed to license certain patents as described in the section captioned “Intellectual Property.”
 Government Regulations
 Government regulations require us to certify our readers and gateways in jurisdictions where they operate. For example, we certify our readers and gateways to Federal Communications Commission regulations to operate in the United States and its territories. Currently, our Speedway readers are certified for operation in more than 40 countries worldwide including the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, South Korea and all of the European Union. Our gateway products have the same or fewer certifications, depending on the recency of the product introduction; we plan to eventually certify them in all countries with compelling market opportunities.
Competition
 We believe we are the only company in our industry with a platform spanning software, connectivity and endpoints. Our competitors compete with us with respect to some, but not all, of our business. Our principal competition in our platform layers include:

• | Software. Zebra Technologies Corporation, or Zebra, and Mojix, Inc.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Readers and Gateways. Alien Technology Corporation, or Alien, and Zebra., both of which also purchase our reader ICs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reader ICs. STMicroelectronics N.V. and Phychips Inc.
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Endpoint ICs. NXP B.V., or NXP, and Alien. In October 2016, Qualcomm Incorporated, or Qualcomm, announced it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire NXP. Qualcomm could use this acquisition as an entry point into the endpoint IC market.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The market for our platform and products is relatively new and highly competitive. We believe competition will increase as the market grows and RAIN technology continues to advance. New entrants could enter our market at any time, creating additional competition in the future. The competitive factors that impact our platform and product sales include:
  
• | portfolio, performance, features, lead times, reliability and price;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | support, ease of use and availability of reference designs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | development tools and API availability (except in the endpoint IC market);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | integration and certification with end-user applications; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | company reputation.
--+--------------------

 Although we believe we compete favorably on the above factors, our future competitiveness will depend upon our ability to design, develop and deliver compelling solutions. We occasionally experience competitive pressures due to prevailing exchange rates as our product pricing is denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition, our competitive position depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain talent while protecting our intellectual property. For additional information on the risks associated with our business, see “Risk Factors.”
