ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, referred to as "the Company", "we", "us" and "our" unless specified otherwise) is a leading omni-channel sporting goods retailer offering an extensive assortment of authentic, high-quality sports equipment, apparel, footwear and accessories through a blend of dedicated associates, in-store services and unique specialty shop-in-shops. The Company also owns and operates Golf Galaxy and Field & Stream specialty concept stores, and Dick's Team Sports HQ, an all-in-one youth sports digital platform offering free league management services, mobile apps for scheduling, communications and live scorekeeping, custom uniforms and FanWear, and access to donations and sponsorships. The Company offers its products through a content-rich eCommerce platform that is integrated with its store network and provides customers with the convenience and expertise of a 24-hour storefront. 
The Company was founded in 1948 when Richard "Dick" Stack, the father of Edward W. Stack, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, opened his original bait and tackle store in Binghamton, New York. Edward W. Stack joined his father's business full-time in 1977 and in 1984 became President and Chief Executive Officer of the then two-store chain. Our vision is to build leading brands that serve and inspire athletes and outdoor enthusiasts around the world to achieve their personal best; create value for our stockholders through the relentless improvement of everything we do; and make a lasting impact in our communities through sport.
We were incorporated in 1948 in New York under the name Dick's Clothing and Sporting Goods, Inc. In November 1997, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation and in April 1999 we changed our name to Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc. Our executive

Business Strategy
The key elements of our business strategy are:
Focus on Our Customer. Our first priority is to put the customer at the center of everything that we do. We are shifting our mindset and our culture to ensure that every decision we make, whether in our stores or at our Customer Support Center ("CSC"), improves the customer’s experience. We will continue to make investments that provide our customer with an enhanced shopping experience. We are increasing spend in our stores for training, faster checkout, enhanced ship-from-store capabilities and more opportunities for our customers to buy online and pick-up in-store.
Our marketing program is designed to build loyalty for the Dick’s Sporting Goods brand while promoting our broad assortment of brand name sporting goods equipment, apparel and footwear in a specialty store environment.  Our historical marketing strategy consisted largely of newspaper advertising supplemented by direct mail and seasonal use of local and national television and radio.  While we continue to market through these traditional channels, we have developed brand-building marketing campaigns focused on building passion and loyalty to the Dick’s Sporting Goods brand and have shifted our advertising mix toward digital marketing and personalization.  We continue to leverage our extensive and expanding customer relationship marketing database from our ScoreCard Rewards program.  The Company is also actively involved in communities, sponsoring thousands of teams at the local level.
We launched our Best Price Guarantee during the summer of 2017 as a promise to our customers that if they find a lower price than ours, we will match it. We are also making significant changes to our ScoreCard loyalty program to make it more rewarding to our customers. At the end of fiscal 2017, we discontinued our practice of expiring accrued ScoreCard points at year-end and moved to a rolling 12-month expiration policy. We believe this will reduce customer frustration and will provide us an opportunity to drive customers back to us after they earn points by shopping with us during the holiday season. We also plan to launch a new tier of our ScoreCard loyalty program during 2018 that will better reward our best customers for their loyalty to us.
Authentic Sporting Goods Retailer. Our history and core foundation is as a retailer of high-quality authentic athletic equipment, apparel and footwear, which is intended to enhance our customers' performance and enjoyment of athletic pursuits, rather than focusing our merchandise selection on the latest fashion trend or style. We believe our customers seek genuine, deep product offerings, and that ultimately this merchandising approach positions us with advantages in the market, which we believe will continue to benefit from new product offerings with enhanced technological features.
Our objective is not only to carry leading brands, but to carry a full range of products within each category, including premium items for the sports enthusiast. We believe that the breadth of our product selections in each category of sporting goods offers our customers a wide range of good, better and best price points and enables us to address the needs of sporting goods consumers, from the beginner to the sports enthusiast, which distinguishes us from other large format sporting goods stores. We also believe that the range of merchandise and extensive in-store support services that we offer allows us to differentiate and compete effectively against all of our competitors, from traditional independent sporting goods stores and specialty shops to other large format sporting goods stores and mass merchant discount retailers to internet-based retailers.
Capturing Displaced Market Share. The sporting goods industry is experiencing consolidation as competitor bankruptcies are leaving behind significant market share. The Company has acquired strategic store locations, customer information and intellectual property from its former competitors, The Sports Authority ("TSA") and Golfsmith, and believes it has realized market share gains as it has leveraged these assets to capture displaced customers. The Company remains focused on continuing to capture displaced market share in the future. Our store growth plans will focus on new and under-penetrated markets which were historically served by our former competitors. We will also continue to leverage industry data acquired in these transactions and utilize acquired customer information to target millions of their customers.

Drive Omni-channel Growth. At the core of our omni-channel business are our stores. We believe when our customers connect with the Dick's Sporting Goods brand they expect a seamless shopping experience, regardless of the manner in which they choose to shop with us. We continue to see growth in the number of customers who shop with us both online and in our stores and believe these omni-channel customers represent the future of retail. 
On January 29, 2017, we transitioned our eCommerce platform from a third-party provider to a proprietary internal platform that now allows us to fully control our customer experience and optimize profitability. The Company's focus will be to invest in our online experience through faster delivery, better pricing, more targeted marketing and continued improvements in our digital channels. Like our customers, we see retail as an omni-channel experience, where the distinctions between stores and online are becoming increasingly irrelevant. 
We believe our store base gives us a competitive advantage over our online-only competitors, as our physical presence allows us to better serve our customers, through the convenience of accepting in-store returns or exchanges and expediting fulfillment of eCommerce orders. We believe that offering support services for the products we sell enhances the credibility of our associates and specialty store concepts with our customers and further differentiates our stores from our competitors. 
Differentiating Dick's Sporting Goods. Our key partners invest in our stores to showcase their brands. We carry a wide variety of well-known brands, including adidas, Asics, Brooks, Callaway Golf, Columbia, Nike, TaylorMade, The North Face, Under Armour and Yeti. We seek to leverage our partnerships to offer authenticity and credibility to our customers, while differentiating ourselves from our competitors. Our brand partnerships also provide us with access to exclusive products and allow us to differentiate our customers' shopping experience through initiatives such as our brand shops, which provide our customers with a wider and deeper selection of products from our key brands.
To provide differentiation in assortment of products when compared to our competitors, we offer a wide variety of private brand products that are not available from other retailers. Our exclusive private brand offerings include brands that we own such as CALIA, Cobra (youth golf sets), ETHOS, Field & Stream, Fitness Gear, Lady Hagen, MAXFLI, Nishiki, Quest, Second Skin, Top-Flite and Walter Hagen, as well as brands that we exclusively license from third parties including adidas baseball and football, Reebok (performance apparel), Slazenger (golf) and Prince (tennis). Our private brands offer exceptional value and quality to our customers, while also providing the Company with higher gross margins than we obtain on sales of comparable third-party branded products. We consider our private brand strategy to be a key area of opportunity to increase productivity in our stores and online, and have invested in a development and procurement staff to support our private brand business. Looking forward, we intend to grow the CALIA line of women's athletic apparel and introduce new private brands during fiscal 2018. The Company's private brand business exceeded $1 billion in sales during fiscal 2017. Private brand sales represented approximately 12%, 10% and 10% of the Company's consolidated net sales during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company is also actively involved in communities, sponsoring thousands of teams in various sports at the local level. The Dick's Team Sports HQ business, which is primarily comprised of Blue Sombrero, Affinity Sports, GameChanger and AD Starr, is focused on creating a holistic digital eco-system to support and equip youth sports and establish relationships with millions of players. We plan to use Dick's Team Sports HQ to stay top-of-mind for athletes and their families, and to create a powerful dataset that we will use to develop offers that are tailored and timed to meet the needs of these athletes.

Segment information is further described within Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Selling Channels
We offer products to our customers through our retail stores and online. Although we sell through both of these channels, we believe that sales in one channel are not independent of the other. Regardless of the sales channel, we seek to provide our customers with a seamless omni-channel shopping experience.
Retail Stores:
Store Format. Each of our Dick's Sporting Goods stores unites several sports specialty stores under one roof and typically contains the following specialty shops: Team Sports, Athletic Apparel, Golf, Outdoor Lodge, Fitness and Footwear. We believe our "store-within-a-store" concept creates a unique shopping environment by combining the convenience, broad assortment and competitive prices of large format stores with the brand names, deep product selection and customer service of a specialty store. Our Golf Galaxy and Field & Stream stores are designed to create an exciting and interactive shopping environment for the sporting enthusiast that highlights our extensive product assortments and value-added services. 
The Company seeks to expand its presence through the opening of new stores, and the Company believes that growing its store network and eCommerce business simultaneously will enable it to profitably grow the business by delivering an omni-channel shopping experience for its customers. We plan to reduce our store growth rate compared to historical levels as the Company monitors the competitive retail landscape and focuses its store growth in under-served and under-penetrated markets. In fiscal 2018, we expect to open approximately 19 new Dick's Sporting Goods stores, which represents a significant reduction from 2017. Additionally, we plan to relocate four Dick's Sporting Goods stores. We do not plan to open new Field & Stream or Golf Galaxy stores in 2018. Approximately 50% of our Dick’s Sporting Goods stores will be up for lease renewal at our option over the next five years. We plan to leverage the significant flexibility within our existing real estate portfolio to capitalize on future real estate opportunities over the near and intermediate term as these leases come up for renewal. 
eCommerce:
Through our websites, we seek to provide our customers with in-depth product information and the ability to shop with us at any time. We continue to develop our online content and capabilities to enhance the online experience and fully integrate our online business with our stores to provide our customers with an omni-channel shopping experience. Currently, we have return-to-store capabilities for online orders, the ability to place online orders in our stores if we are out of stock in the retail store and buy online pick-up in-store capabilities. We also have the ability through our websites to ship orders placed online from our retail locations, which reduces delivery times for online orders and improves inventory productivity. In fiscal 2017, eCommerce accounted for 12.4% of our total net sales.

Purchasing, Distribution and Customer Fulfillment
During fiscal 2017, we purchased merchandise from approximately 1,300 vendors. Nike, our largest vendor, represented approximately 18% of our merchandise purchases. No other vendor represented 10% or more of our fiscal 2017 merchandise purchases. We do not have long-term purchase contracts with any of our vendors and all of our purchases from vendors are made on a short-term purchase order basis.
During fiscal 2017, we implemented a new merchandising and vendor matrix to better serve our customers. Our strategic vendors will provide us with exclusive and differentiated products in the marketplace while significantly investing in our business, both online and in-store. We plan to move market share to these partners to drive growth in our respective businesses. We will continue to maintain transactional relationships with other vendors. We plan to continuously evaluate our remaining vendors whose merchandise does not fit within our vendor and merchandise assortment strategy.
We currently operate five regional distribution centers to supply stores with merchandise. Vendors directly ship floor-ready merchandise to our distribution centers, where it is processed and allocated directly to our stores or to temporary storage at our distribution centers. Our distribution centers are responsible for consolidating damaged or defective merchandise from our stores that is being returned to vendors. We have contracted with common carriers to deliver merchandise from all of our distribution centers to our stores. During fiscal 2017, our stores received approximately 94% of merchandise through our distribution network with the remaining merchandise being shipped directly to the stores from our vendors. We believe this flow of merchandise facilitates prompt and efficient distribution to our stores in order to enhance in-stocks, minimize freight costs and improve our inventory turns. 
The Company leverages various fulfillment channels to ensure merchandise delivery speed to our customers and to minimize shipping costs. The Company leverages its store network, a third-party operated fulfillment center and its vendors to ship merchandise to its customers.
Competition
The market for sporting goods retailers is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We compete with many retailing formats, including large format sporting goods stores, traditional sporting goods stores, specialty and vendor stores, mass merchants and department stores, internet and catalog-based retailers, and vendors selling directly to consumers. We seek to attract customers by offering a wide range of products utilizing distinctive marketing in stores to create a unique shopping environment and superior service through an omni-channel experience.
Employees
As of February 3, 2018, we employed approximately 15,400 full-time and 29,800 part-time associates. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, total employment figures fluctuate throughout the year and typically peak during the fourth quarter. None of our associates are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our associates are good.

Governmental Regulations
We must comply with various federal, state and local regulations, including regulations relating to consumer products and consumer protection, advertising and marketing, labor and employment, data protection and privacy, intellectual property, the environment and tax. In addition, in connection with the sale of firearms in our stores, we must comply with a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to the sale of firearms and ammunition, including the federal Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.
