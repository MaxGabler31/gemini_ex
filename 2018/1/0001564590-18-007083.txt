Item 1.  Business 
GENERAL 
 In this Form 10-K, all references to the “Company” or “Movado Group” include Movado Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. 
 Movado Group designs, sources, markets and distributes fine watches. Its portfolio of watch brands is currently comprised of Coach®, Concord®, Ebel®, Olivia Burton®, Rebecca Minkoff® and Uri Minkoff®, Scuderia Ferrari®, HUGO BOSS®, Juicy Couture®, Lacoste®, Movado®, and Tommy Hilfiger®. The Company is a leader in the design, development, marketing and distribution of watch brands sold in almost every major category comprising the watch industry. 
 The Company was incorporated in New York in 1967 under the name North American Watch Corporation to acquire Piaget Watch Corporation and Corum Watch Corporation, which had been, respectively, the exclusive importers and distributors of Piaget and Corum watches in the United States since the 1950’s. The Company sold its Piaget and Corum distribution businesses in 1999 and 2000, respectively, to focus on its own portfolio of brands. Since its incorporation, the Company has developed its brand-building reputation and distinctive image across an expanding number of brands and geographic markets. Strategic acquisitions of watch brands and their subsequent growth, along with license agreements, have played an important role in the expansion of the Company’s brand portfolio. 
 In 1970, the Company acquired the Concord brand and the Swiss company that had been manufacturing Concord watches since 1908. In 1983, the Company acquired the U.S. distributor of Movado watches and substantially all of the assets related to the Movado brand from the Swiss manufacturer of Movado watches. The Company changed its name to Movado Group, Inc. in 1996. In March 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of Ebel, one of the world’s premier luxury watch brands which was established in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland in 1911. In July 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Olivia Burton, which was founded in 2011 and is one of the United Kingdom’s fastest-growing fashion watch and jewelry brands.  
 The Company is highly selective in its licensing strategy and chooses to enter into long-term agreements with only powerful brands with strong positions in their respective businesses. 
 The following table sets forth the brands licensed by the Company and the year in which the Company launched each licensed brand for watches. 
 
 
Brand | Licensor | Calendar Year Launched

 The Company previously licensed the right to manufacture and distribute watches under the Juicy Couture brand name from ABG Juicy Couture, LLC. However, the Company and the licensor decided to allow the Juicy Couture license agreement to expire by its terms on December 31, 2017, although the Company retains the right to sell-off all remaining inventory. 
 The Company’s common stock is traded on the NYSE under the trading symbol MOV.

 On August 29, 2017, the Board of Directors approved the payment of a cash dividend of $0.13 for each share of the Company’s outstanding common stock and class A common stock. The dividend was paid on September 25, 2017 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 11, 2017. 
 On August 29, 2017, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to purchase up to $50.0 million of its outstanding common stock from time to time, depending on market conditions, share price and other factors. The Company may purchase shares of its common stock through open market purchases, repurchase plans, block trades or otherwise. This authorization expires on August 29, 2020. Concurrent with this approval, the Board of Directors cancelled the previously authorized $50.0 million share buyback program which would have expired on September 30, 2017 and under which approximately $5.5 million had been repurchased.
 On July 3, 2017, the Company, through a wholly-owned U.K. subsidiary, acquired JLB Brands Ltd., the owner of the Olivia Burton brand, for $78.2 million, or £60.0 million in cash, subject to working capital and other closing adjustments. After giving effect to the closing adjustments, the purchase price was $79.0 million, or £60.7 million, net of cash acquired of approximately $5.9 million, or £4.5 million. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries. No debt was assumed in the acquisition. The acquisition added a new brand with significant global growth potential to the Company’s portfolio. The results of the JLB Brands Ltd.’s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of its acquisition within the International location of the Wholesale segment.
 On May 25, 2017, the Board of Directors approved the payment of a cash dividend of $0.13 for each share of the Company’s outstanding common stock and class A common stock. The dividend was paid on June 20, 2017 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 6, 2017.  
 On March 20, 2017, the Company announced cost savings initiatives to better align its global infrastructure with the current business environment by consolidating certain operations and streamlining functions to reduce costs and improve profitability. The cost savings initiatives include a reduction in the Company’s workforce in its North American and Swiss operations as well as charges for fixed assets, occupancy, and other expenses. In light of the changing retail landscape and the growing importance of digital marketing and online sales, the Company also decided in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to cease its participation in the Baselworld Watch and Jewelry Show. As a result, the Company recorded charges for the write-off of certain fixed assets and other contract termination costs. In fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a total of $13.6 million of pre-tax expenses in connection with these actions. The cost savings initiatives have been substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2018.

BRANDS 
 The Company designs, develops, sources, markets and distributes products under the following watch brands: 
 Owned Brands
 Concord 
 Concord was founded in 1908 in Bienne, Switzerland. Concord is a luxury watch brand with a rich history studded with iconic, award-winning timepieces and an innovative direction. Acquired by the Company in the early 1970s, Concord was re-launched as a dynamic, highly original niche brand which, in recent years, has implemented an energetic repositioning. This has encompassed a fundamental change in shifting from a revolution driven strategy to an evolution driven counterpart. Rooted in a determination to build on the remarkable technical achievements of its recent past while combining them with its current visionary thinking, this approach is entirely in keeping with the very name, Concord, which means harmony. Concord watches have Swiss movements and are made with solid 18 karat gold, stainless steel or a combination of 18 karat gold and stainless steel. Some are set with diamonds.
Ebel 
 The Ebel brand was established in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland in 1911. Ebel’s success has been built upon the perfect fusion of technical excellence and a passion for aesthetically daring and timeless, distinctive design. A passion for innovation and excellence in watch design has always been at the heart of the Ebel brand. Since its inception, Ebel has remained true to its core values, manufacturing fine Swiss watches that marry beauty and function. Renowned today for its iconic bracelet design with signature wave-shaped links, Ebel continues to create timepieces that embody luxury and contemporary elegance with subtle, yet exquisite detail. All Ebel watches feature Swiss movements and are made with solid 18 karat yellow or rose gold, stainless steel or a combination of 18 karat yellow or rose gold, ceramic and, or stainless steel. Some are set with diamonds.
Movado 
 The Movado brand is renowned for its iconic Museum® dial and modern design aesthetic. Since its founding in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland in 1881, Movado has earned more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and technology, and Movado timepieces have won world renown for their unique beauty and timeless design.
 Movado is a hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created, most notably, the Movado Museum® Watch. Designed in 1947 by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt, the watch dial defined by a solitary dot at 12:00, symbolizing the sun at high noon, has been acclaimed for purity of design unrivaled in the history of time-keeping. When Horwitt’s dial was selected for the permanent design collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it became the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. Known today as the Movado Museum Watch, this legendary dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. A trademarked and award-winning design, the celebrated single dot dial now distinguishes a wide range of Movado timepieces.
 Along with its long, rich heritage of design innovation, the Movado brand experience is also defined by a close, enduring association with the arts. Expressions of Movado’s commitment to the fine and cultural arts encompass commissioned watch designs by famed artists, affiliations with talented brand ambassadors, sponsorship of major arts institutions and support of emerging artists.
 The Movado BOLD collection represents iconic Movado design re-imagined for the fashion-savvy, on-trend consumer. It is innovative in both design and use of materials. The Movado Heritage collection, launched in the spring of 2016, is inspired by Movado’s rich pre-Museum dial history.  Heritage uses the past to create new designs that are modern and relevant.
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company launched the use of smartwatch technology in its Movado brand watches.
 Olivia Burton
 Founded by ex-fashion buyers, Olivia Burton was born in 2012 when a gap in the market was identified for beautifully designed watches. Following the identification of the market gap, the Olivia Burton brand was launched in Harvey Nichols in the UK. The brand was well received with some styles selling out straight away. Inspired by vintage aesthetic and catwalk trends, Olivia Burton releases new collections every two months to give customers the chance to create their own watch wardrobe and regularly update their outfit with a new timepiece. Each collection is carefully designed to reflect current trends that fit the brand’s DNA. This has helped to establish Olivia Burton as one of the most exciting and directional women’s fashion watch brands in the global market. In 2016, the brand launched a jewelry collection that follows the brand ethos to be beautifully designed, high in quality and affordable.

Senior management of the Company is actively involved in the design and product development process.

MARKETING 
 The Company’s marketing strategy is to communicate a consistent, brand-specific message to the consumer. As the consumer footprint continues to evolve, the Company is increasingly focused on its digital marketing and online reach, including expanding and improving its social media channels and its messaging through individuals with significant social media followings (i.e., “influencers”). On March 7, 2018, the Company announced that it is developing a Digital Center of Excellence to help elevate its customers’ digital experience globally through innovative technologies and consumer-facing initiatives. Recognizing that advertising is an integral component to the successful marketing of its product offerings, the Company devotes significant resources to advertising and maintains its own in-house advertising department which focuses primarily on the implementation and management of global marketing and advertising strategies for each of the Company’s brands, ensuring consistency of presentation. The Company develops advertising campaigns individually for each of the Company’s brands, utilizing outside agencies as deemed appropriate. These campaigns are directed primarily to the end consumer rather than to trade customers. The Company’s advertising targets consumers with particular demographic characteristics appropriate to the image and price range of each brand. Company advertising is placed in magazines and other print media, on radio and television, online, including websites and social media platforms, in catalogs, on outdoor signs and through other promotional materials. Marketing expenses totaled 12.9%, 13.7% and 13.0% of net sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
OPERATING SEGMENTS 
 The Company conducts its business primarily in two operating segments: Wholesale and Retail. For operating segment data and geographic segment data for the years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding Segment and Geographic Information. 
 The Company’s Wholesale segment includes the design, development, sourcing, marketing and distribution of high quality watches, and unallocated corporate expenses, in addition to after-sales service activities and shipping. The Retail segment includes the Company’s retail outlet locations.
 The Company divides its business into two major geographic locations: United States operations, and International, which includes the results of all other Company operations. The allocation of geographic revenue is based upon the location of the customer. The Company’s International operations in Europe, the Americas (excluding the United States), the Middle East and Asia account for 32.1%, 9.2%, 7.7% and 5.1%, respectively, of the Company’s total net sales for fiscal 2018. Substantially all of the Company’s tangible International assets are owned by the Company’s Swiss and Hong Kong subsidiaries. For a discussion of the risks associated with the Company’s operations conducted outside the United States, see “A significant portion of the Company’s business is conducted outside of the United States. Many factors affecting business activities outside the United States could adversely impact this business” under Item 1A. Risk Factors, below.
 Wholesale 
 United States Wholesale 
 The Company sells all of its brands in the U.S. wholesale market primarily to department stores, such as Macy’s and Nordstrom; major jewelry store chains, such as Signet Jewelers, Ltd. and Helzberg Diamonds Corp.; independent jewelers and online retailers, such as Amazon; as well as the Company’s e-commerce business, such as www.movado.com. Sales to trade customers in the United States are made directly by the Company’s U.S. sales force and, to a lesser extent, independent sales representatives. Sales representatives are responsible for a defined geographic territory, generally specialize in a particular brand and sell to and service independent jewelers within their territory. The sales force also consists of account executives and account representatives who, respectively, sell to and service chain and department store accounts. 
International Wholesale 
 Internationally, the Company’s brands are sold in department stores, jewelry chains, independent jewelers and online retailers. The Company employs its own international sales force operating at the Company’s sales and distribution offices in Canada, China, Germany, France, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, the Company sells all of its brands through a network of independent distributors operating in numerous countries around the world. A majority of the Company’s arrangements with its international distributors are long-term, generally require certain minimum purchases and minimum advertising expenditures and impose restrictions on the distributor’s sale of competitive products. 
 7


Retail 
 The Company’s subsidiary, Movado Retail Group, Inc., operates 40 retail outlet locations in outlet centers across the United States, which serve as an effective vehicle to sell current and discontinued models and factory seconds of all of the Company’s watches. 
SEASONALITY 
 The Company’s sales are traditionally greater during the Christmas and holiday season. Consequently, the Company’s net sales historically have been higher during the second half of its fiscal year. The amount of net sales and operating profit generated during the second half of each fiscal year depends upon the general level of retail sales during the Christmas and holiday season, as well as economic conditions and other factors beyond the Company’s control. Major selling seasons in certain international markets center on significant local holidays that occur in late winter or early spring. The second half of each fiscal year accounted for 59.8% (which includes the acquisition of the Olivia Burton brand on July 3, 2017), 56.2% and 55.3% of the Company’s net sales for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
BACKLOG 
 At March 22, 2018, the Company had unfilled orders of $42.9 million compared to $45.0 million at March 14, 2017 and $50.3 million at March 24, 2016. Unfilled orders include both confirmed orders and orders that the Company believes will be confirmed based on the historical experience with the customers. It is customary for many of the Company’s customers not to confirm their future orders with formal purchase orders until shortly before their desired delivery dates. 
CUSTOMER SERVICE, WARRANTY AND REPAIR 
 The Company assists in the retail sales process of its wholesale customers by monitoring their sales and inventories by product category and style. The Company also assists in the conception, development and implementation of customers’ marketing vehicles. The Company places considerable emphasis on cooperative advertising programs with its wholesale customers. The Company’s assistance in the retail sales process has resulted in close relationships with its principal customers, often allowing for influence on the mix, quantity and timing of their purchasing decisions. The Company believes that customers’ familiarity with its sales approach has facilitated, and should continue to facilitate, the introduction of new products through its distribution network. 
 The Company permits the return of damaged or defective products. In addition, although the Company generally has no obligation to do so, it accepts other returns from customers in certain instances. 
 The Company has service facilities around the world, including four Company-owned service facilities and multiple independent service centers which are authorized to perform warranty repairs. A list of authorized service centers can be accessed online at www.mgiservice.com. In order to maintain consistency and quality at its service facilities and authorized independent service centers, the Company conducts training sessions and distributes technical information and updates to repair personnel. All watches sold by the Company come with limited warranties covering the movement against defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from two to three years from the date of purchase, with the exception of Tommy Hilfiger watches, for which the warranty period is ten years. In addition, the warranty period is five years for the gold plating on certain Movado watch cases and bracelets. Products that are returned under warranty to the Company are generally serviced by the Company’s employees at its service facilities. 
 The Company retains adequate levels of component parts to facilitate after-sales service of its watches for an extended period of time after the discontinuance of the manufacturing of such watches. 
 The Company makes available a web-based system at www.mgiservice.com providing immediate access for the Company’s retail partners to information they may want or need about after sales service issues. The website allows the Company’s retailers to track their repair status online 24 hours a day. The system also permits customers to authorize repairs, track repair status through the entire repair life cycle, view repair information and obtain service order history. 
 SOURCING, PRODUCTION AND QUALITY 
 The Company does not manufacture any of the products it sells. The Company employs a flexible manufacturing model that relies on independent manufacturers to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences. All product sources must achieve and maintain the Company’s high-quality standards and specifications. With strong supply chain organizations predominantly in Switzerland, China and Hong Kong, the Company maintains control over the quality of its products, wherever they are manufactured. Compliance is monitored with strictly enforced quality control standards, including on-site quality inspections.

The Company also owns, and has pending applications for, a number of design patents in the United States and internationally for various watch designs, as well as designs of watch dials, cases, bracelets and jewelry. 
 The Company actively seeks to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights by working with industry associations, anti-counterfeiting organizations, private investigators and law enforcement authorities, including customs authorities in the United States and internationally, and, when necessary, suing infringers of its trademarks and patents. Consequently, the Company is involved from time to time in litigation or other proceedings to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of these rights. The Company has registered the trademarks MOVADO®, OLIVIA BURTON®, EBEL®, CONCORD® and certain other related trademarks with customs authorities in the United States and certain other countries in order to assist such authorities in their efforts to prevent the importation of counterfeit goods or goods bearing confusingly similar trademarks. Customs regulations do not, however, cover the unauthorized importation of genuine Movado, Olivia Burton, Ebel and Concord watches. 
 COMPETITION 
 The markets for each of the Company’s watch brands are highly competitive. With the exception of Swatch Group, Ltd., a large Swiss-based competitor, no single company competes with the Company across all of its brands. Multiple companies, however, compete with Movado Group with respect to one or more of its watch brands. Certain of these companies have, and other companies that may enter the Company’s markets in the future may have, greater financial, distribution, marketing and advertising resources than the Company. The Company’s future success will depend, to a significant degree, upon its continued ability to compete effectively with regard to, among other things, the style, quality, price, advertising, marketing, distribution and availability of supply of the Company’s watches and other products. 
EMPLOYEES 
 As of January 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 1,000 full-time employees in its global operations. Approximately 159 Company employees in Switzerland and 19 Company employees in France are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Company has never experienced a work stoppage due to labor difficulties and believes that its employee relations are good.
