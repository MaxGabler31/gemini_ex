Item 1. Business.
Company Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. We market two U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies, including Ampyra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10mg, a treatment to improve walking in adult patients with multiple sclerosis, or MS, as demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. Ampyra 2017 net revenue was $543 million, an increase of approximately 10% over 2016. We have a pipeline of novel neurological therapies addressing a range of disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and MS.
 We currently derive substantially all our revenue from the sale of Ampyra. In March 2017, we announced a decision by the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in litigation with certain generic drug manufacturers upholding our Ampyra Orange Book-listed patent set to expire on July 30, 2018, but invalidating our four other Orange Book-listed patents pertaining to Ampyra that were set to expire between 2025 and 2027. Under this decision, we expect to maintain patent exclusivity with respect to Ampyra at least through July 30, 2018, depending on the outcome of appeal of the District Court’s decision. The defendant generic drug manufacturers have appealed the District Court’s decision upholding the patent that expires in July 2018, and we have appealed the ruling on the four invalidated patents. We expect the appeals process to take approximately 12 to 18 months from the filing of the appeal in May 2017. The date for oral argument will be scheduled by the appellate court, which we expect will be in the first half of 2018.
 We expect to experience a rapid and significant decline in Ampyra sales beyond July 2018 due to competition from generic versions of Ampyra that may be marketed after the expiration of our remaining Ampyra patent, unless the District Court’s decision on the four invalidated patents is overturned on appeal, which could include reversal or remand by the appeals court back to the District Court. If the appeals court does not overturn the District Court’s decision by July 30, 2018, multiple ANDA filers may be able to launch generic versions of Ampyra absent injunctive relief. In April 2017, following the District Court’s decision, we implemented a corporate restructuring to reduce our cost structure and focus our resources on our most important and valuable initiatives, including our Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder) development program and maximizing Ampyra value. As part of this restructuring, we reduced headcount by approximately 20%. The majority of the reduction was completed in April 2017.
 Inbrija, our most advanced development program, is a self-administered, inhaled formulation of levodopa, or L-dopa, being investigated for the treatment of OFF periods in people with Parkinson’s disease who are taking a carbidopa/levodopa regimen. Inbrija is based on our proprietary ARCUS platform, a dry-powder pulmonary drug delivery technology that we believe has potential applications in multiple disease areas. We announced positive Phase 3 efficacy and safety data for this program in 2017. In June 2017, we submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, for Inbrija to the FDA. In August 2017, we announced that we received a Refusal to File, or RTF, letter from the FDA regarding the Inbrija NDA. Upon its preliminary review, the FDA determined that the NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. The FDA specified two reasons for the RTF: first, the date when the manufacturing site would be ready for inspection; and second, a question regarding the submission of the drug master production record. The FDA also requested additional information at resubmission, which was not part of the basis for the RTF. We resubmitted the NDA in December 2017. The resubmission addressed the two issues raised in the RTF and included all additional information requested by the FDA in the RTF. On February 20, 2018, we announced that the resubmitted NDA was accepted for filing by the FDA, and that under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has set a target date of October 5, 2018. Our commercial preparations for the launch of Inbrija continue. We are projecting that, if approved, annual peak net revenue of Inbrija in the U.S. alone could exceed $800 million. We expect to file a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency in the first quarter of 2018. We are in discussions with potential partners regarding Inbrija outside of the U.S.
 In November 2017, we discontinued our clinical development program for tozadenant, an investigational treatment for reduction of OFF time in people with Parkinson’s that we acquired with our 2016 acquisition of Biotie Therapies. We made this decision based on new information obtained from our Phase 3 clinical trials related to agranulocytosis and associated serious adverse events.
 In November 2017, we completed a $40 million Fampyra royalty monetization with HealthCare Royalty Partners, or HCRP. In return for the payment to us, HCRP obtained the right to receive Fampyra royalties payable to us by Biogen, up to an agreed upon threshold of royalties. After this threshold is met, if ever, we will continue to receive Fampyra royalty

revenue from Biogen until this revenue stream ends. The transaction does not include potential future milestones to be paid by Biogen. In November 2017, we also completed a $13 million Selincro royalty monetization with Lundbeck. In exchange for the payment from Lundbeck, we agreed to amend the Selincro license with Lundbeck to eliminate future royalty and milestone obligations on sales of Selincro outside of the U.S. Also, we sold our Zanaflex franchise for $4 million.
 As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $307.1 million and we are projecting a 2018 year-end cash balance in excess of $300 million. We have $345 million of convertible senior notes due in 2021 with a conversion price of $42.56. We believe that operating expense reductions from the restructuring, as well as additional expense reductions due to termination of the tozadenant development program, will enable us to fund operations through launch of Inbrija in the U.S., pending approval from the FDA. Importantly, we have kept our commercial team intact despite the restructuring. We believe we have built a leading neuro-specialty sales and marketing team through our commercialization of Ampyra, and that our commercial launch of Inbrija in the U.S., if approved, will benefit from the experiences and capabilities of this team.
 Our strategy is to continue growing as a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company. Our priorities for 2018 include advancing our Inbrija program toward approval and commercialization, maximizing the value of Ampyra, including our appeal of the District Court decision invalidating certain Ampyra patents as described above, and focusing on financial discipline and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
 Company Highlights
 Ampyra 
 Ampyra is the first product for which we completed clinical development. Ampyra, an extended release tablet formulation of dalfampridine (4-aminopyridine, 4-AP), was approved by the FDA in January 2010. Ampyra demonstrated efficacy in people with all four major types of MS (relapsing remitting, secondary progressive, progressive relapsing and primary progressive). To our knowledge, Ampyra is the first and only product indicated to improve walking in adults with MS. Ampyra was made commercially available in the U.S. in March 2010, using our own specialty sales force, and had net revenue of $543 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Since the March 2010 launch of Ampyra, approximately 130,000 people with MS in the U.S. have tried Ampyra. We believe that Ampyra is increasingly considered by many physicians a standard of care to improve walking in adults with MS. Eight years after approval, Ampyra continues to grow, reflecting the continued unmet medical need among adults with MS for a treatment to improve walking. Our 60-day free trial program provides eligible patients with two months of Ampyra at no cost.
 Three of the largest national health plans in the U.S. – Aetna, Cigna and United Healthcare – have listed Ampyra on their commercial formulary. Approximately 75% of insured individuals in the U.S. continue to have no or limited prior authorizations, or PA’s, for Ampyra. We define limited PAs as those that require only an MS diagnosis, documentation of no contraindications, and/or simple documentation that the patient has a walking impairment; such documentation may include a Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25W) test. The access figure is calculated based on the number of pharmacy lives reported by health plans.
 Approximately 400,000 people in the U.S. suffer from MS, and each year approximately 10,000 people in the U.S. are newly diagnosed. In a poll of more than 2,000 people with MS, 87% said they experienced some limitation to their walking ability and limited activities that involved walking. Among MS patients diagnosed within the last 5 years, 58% report experiencing mobility issues at least twice a week. In the European Union, over 700,000 people suffer from MS, and an additional 100,000 people in Canada are also diagnosed with this disease.
 Ampyra is marketed as Fampyra outside the U.S. by Biogen International GmbH, or Biogen, under a 2009 license and collaboration agreement. Fampyra has been approved in a number of countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas. Under our agreement with Biogen, we are entitled to receive double-digit tiered royalties on sales of Fampyra and we are also entitled to receive additional payments based on achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones. In November 2017, we announced a $40 million Fampyra royalty monetization transaction with HealthCare Royalty Partners, or HCRP. In return for the payment to us, HCRP obtained the right to receive these Fampyra royalties up to an agreed-upon threshold. Until this threshold is met, if ever, we will not receive Fampyra royalty revenue although we have retained the right to receive any potential future milestone payments. The next expected milestone payment would be $15 million, due when ex-U.S. net sales exceed $100 million over four consecutive quarters.

Ampyra/Fampyra Patents and Legal Proceedings
 We have five issued patents listed in the Orange Book for Ampyra, four of which were held invalid in litigation in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware with certain generic drug manufacturers, as further described below in this report. The first is U.S. Patent No. 5,540,938, the claims of which relate to methods for treating a neurological disease, such as MS, and cover the use of a sustained release dalfampridine formulation, such as Ampyra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg for improving walking in people with MS. In April 2013, this patent received a five year patent term extension under the patent restoration provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. With a five year patent term extension, this patent will expire on July 30, 2018. We have an exclusive license to this patent from Alkermes (originally with Elan, but transferred to Alkermes as part of its acquisition of Elan’s Drug Technologies business). This patent was held valid by the District Court in the litigation, although in June 2017 the defendant generic drug manufacturers with whom we have not reached settlements appealed the District Court’s decision upholding this patent.
 The other four Orange Book-listed patents were held invalid by the District Court in the litigation with generic drug manufacturers. These patents, which had been set to expire in 2025 through 2027, consist of U.S. Patent No. 8,007,826, with claims relating to methods to improve walking in patients with MS by administering 10 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily; U.S. Patent No. 8,354,437, which includes claims relating to methods to improve walking, increase walking speed, and treat walking disability in patients with MS by administering 10 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily; U.S. Patent No. 8,440,703, which includes claims directed to methods of improving lower extremity function and walking and increasing walking speed in patients with MS by administering less than 15 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily; and U.S. Patent No. 8,663,685 with claims relating to methods to improve walking in patients with MS by administering 10 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily.
 The patent litigation referenced above relates to Paragraph IV Certification Notices received from ten generic drug manufacturers in 2014 and 2015, who submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDAs, with the FDA seeking marketing approval for generic versions of Ampyra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10mg. The ANDA filers challenged the validity of our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra, and they also asserted that generic versions of their products do not infringe certain claims of these patents. In 2015 and 2016, we reached settlement agreements with six of the generic companies. A bench trial against the remaining four generic companies was completed in September 2016. In February 2017, we announced that we had reached a settlement agreement with one of those four generic companies. In March 2017, the District Court rendered a decision upholding our Orange-Book listed patent for Ampyra set to expire in July 2018, but invalidating our four other Orange Book-listed patents. In May 2017, we appealed the ruling on these four patents, and as described above, in June 2017 the other non-settling parties appealed the decision on the patent set to expire in July 2018. We expect the appeals process to take approximately 12 to 18 months from the filing of the appeal in May 2017. Both the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) filed amicus briefs in support of our appeal, raising important issues in conjunction with biopharmaceutical innovation. The date for oral argument will be scheduled by the appellate court, which we expect will be in the first half of 2018. We expect to experience a rapid and significant decline in Ampyra sales beyond July 2018 due to competition from generic versions of Ampyra that may be marketed after the expiration of our remaining Ampyra patent, unless the District Court’s decision on the four invalidated patents is overturned on appeal, which could include reversal or remand by the appeals court back to the District Court. If the appeals court does not overturn the District Court’s decision by July 30, 2018, multiple ANDA filers may be able to launch generic versions of Ampyra absent injunctive relief.
 In April 2017, we received a Paragraph IV Certification Notice from an additional generic drug manufacturer, Micro Labs Ltd. (“Micro”), advising that it had submitted an ANDA to the FDA seeking marketing approval for a generic version of Ampyra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10mg. Micro challenged the validity of four of our five Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra, and also asserted that a generic version of its product does not infringe certain claims of these patents. In response to the filing of the ANDA, in May 2017 we filed a lawsuit against Micro in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. In January 2018, we reached a settlement agreement with Micro, which is further described below in Part I, Item 3 of this report.
 In 2011, the European Patent Office, or EPO, granted EP 1732548, with claims relating to, among other things, use of a sustained release aminopyridine composition, such as dalfampridine (known under the trade name Fampyra in the European Union), to increase walking speed. In March 2012, Synthon B.V. and neuraxpharm Arzneimittel GmBH filed oppositions with the EPO challenging the EP 1732548 patent. We defended the patent, and in December 2013, we announced that the EPO Opposition Division upheld amended claims in this patent covering a sustained release formulation of dalfampridine for increasing walking in patients with MS through twice daily dosing at 10 mg. Both Synthon B.V. and neuraxpharm 
 3


Arzneimittel GmBH have appealed the decision. In December 2013, Synthon B.V., neuraxpharm Arzneimittel GmBH and Actavis Group PTC EHF filed oppositions with the EPO challenging our EP 2377536 patent, which is a divisional of the EP 1732548 patent. In February 2016, the EPO Opposition Division rendered a decision that revoked the EP 2377536 patent. We believe the claims of this patent are valid and we have appealed the decision. Both European patents, if upheld as valid, are set to expire in 2025, absent any additional exclusivity granted based on regulatory review timelines. Fampyra also has 10 years of market exclusivity in the European Union that is set to expire in 2021.
 Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder)/Parkinson’s Disease
 Inbrija is a self-administered, inhaled formulation of levodopa, or L-dopa, for the treatment of OFF periods in people with Parkinson’s disease who are taking a carbidopa/levodopa regimen. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the gradual loss of certain neurons in the brain responsible for producing dopamine. The disease causes a range of symptoms such as impaired ability to move, muscle stiffness and tremor. The standard of care for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease is oral carbidopa/levodopa, but oral medication can be associated with wide variability in the timing and amount of absorption and there are significant challenges in creating a regimen that consistently maintains therapeutic effects as Parkinson’s disease progresses. The re-emergence of symptoms is referred to as an OFF period, and despite optimized regimens with current therapeutic options and strategies, OFF periods remain one of the most challenging aspects of the disease.
 Inbrija delivers a precise dose of dry-powder formulation of L-dopa to the lung using a breath-actuated proprietary inhaler. Oral medication can be associated with slow and variable onset of action, as the medicine is absorbed through the gastrointestinal (digestive) tract before reaching the brain. Inhaled treatments enter the body through the lungs and reach the brain shortly thereafter, bypassing the digestive system. Inbrija is based on our proprietary ARCUS platform, a dry-powder pulmonary drug delivery technology that we believe has potential applications in multiple disease areas. A key feature of our ARCUS technology is the large porous particles that allow for consistent and precise delivery of significantly larger doses of medication than are possible with conventional dry powder pulmonary systems. This in turn provides the potential for pulmonary delivery of a much wider variety of pharmaceutical agents. We have worldwide rights to our ARCUS drug delivery technology, which is protected by extensive know-how and trade secrets and various U.S. and foreign patents, including patents that protect the Inbrija dry powder capsules beyond 2030.
 In 2016, we completed a Phase 3 efficacy and safety clinical trial of Inbrija for the treatment of OFF periods in Parkinson’s disease. In February 2017, we announced efficacy and safety data from this clinical trial, showing a statistically significant improvement in motor function in people with Parkinson’s experiencing OFF periods. The clinical trial had three arms: Inbrija 84 mg and 60 mg doses (equivalent to 50 mg and 35 mg fine particle doses, respectively), and placebo. The trial met its primary outcome measure of improvement in motor function as measured by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale-Part 3 (UPDRS Part III) in people with Parkinson’s experiencing OFF periods. UPDRS III is a validated scale, which measures Parkinson’s disease motor impairment. The primary endpoint was measured at 30 minutes post-treatment for the 84 mg dose at the 12-week visit. UPDRS Part III change was -9.83 compared to -5.91 for placebo with a p value of 0.009. The magnitude of Inbrija’s benefit versus baseline was consistent with the data from the prior Phase 2b clinical trial, further described below, and represents a statistically significant, clinically meaningful improvement in motor function. The placebo-adjusted difference was lower in the Phase 3 clinical trial than the Phase 2b clinical trial but still represented a clinically important difference. In June 2017, we announced additional data from the Inbrija Phase 3 efficacy and safety trial at the International Congress of Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders (MDS). The secondary endpoints of achievement of an ON state with maintenance through 60 minutes (statistically significant), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and reduction in UPDRS III score at 10 minutes were supportive of the primary endpoint result.
 The safety profile of Inbrija in the trial was consistent with that observed in a prior Phase 2b clinical trial:
  
• | 84 mg, 60 mg and Placebo: Adverse events reported in any study arm at greater than 5% were cough, upper respiratory tract infection, throat irritation, nausea and sputum discoloration. Cough was the most common adverse event, reported by approximately 15% of subjects who received Inbrija. When reported, it was typically mild and reported once per participant during the course of treatment. Three of 227 participants receiving Inbrija discontinued the study due to cough. Reports of serious adverse events were: 3, or 2.7% in the placebo arm, 6, or 5.3% in the 60 mg arm, and 2, or 1.8% in the 84 mg arm. There was one death in the study, a suicide in the 60 mg group, judged by the investigator not to be related to drug.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 84 mg: The most commonly reported adverse events in the Inbrija 84 mg group compared to the placebo group were: cough (14.9% vs. 1.8%, reported mostly once/subject), upper respiratory tract infection (6.1% vs. 2.7%),
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

nausea (5.3% vs. 2.7%), sputum discoloration (5.3% vs. 0%) and dyskinesia (3.5% vs. 0.0%). When cough was reported, it was typically characterized as mild. Two of 114 participants receiving Inbrija 84 mg discontinued the study due to cough.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Results from a separate Phase 3 study to assess the long-term safety profile of Inbrija in people with Parkinson’s showed no statistical difference in pulmonary function between the group receiving Inbrija and an observational control group. These results are consistent with the previously reported Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical trials. In March 2017, we announced results from separate clinical studies that assessed the safety profile of Inbrija in people with asthma, smokers and early morning OFF.
 In June 2017, we submitted an NDA for Inbrija to the FDA. In August 2017, we announced that we received a Refusal to File, or RTF, letter from the FDA regarding the Inbrija NDA. Upon its preliminary review, the FDA determined that the NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. The FDA specified two reasons for the RTF: first, the date when the manufacturing site would be ready for inspection; and second, a question regarding the submission of the drug master production record. The FDA also requested additional information at resubmission, which was not part of the basis for the RTF. We resubmitted the NDA in December 2017. The resubmission addressed the two issues raised in the RTF and included all additional information requested by the FDA in the RTF. On February 20, 2018, we announced that the resubmitted NDA was accepted for filing by the FDA, and that under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has set a target date of October 5, 2018. The NDA was submitted under section 505(b)(2) of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, referencing data from the branded L-dopa product Sinemet®. We believe the Phase 3 efficacy and safety clinical trial, combined with data from additional Phase 3 long-term safety studies and supported by existing Phase 2b data, are sufficient for the NDA filing. Our commercial preparations for the launch of Inbrija continue. We are projecting that, if approved, annual peak net revenue of Inbrija in the U.S. alone could exceed $800 million. We expect to file a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency in the first quarter of 2018. We are in discussions with potential partners regarding Inbrija outside of the U.S.
 ARCUS Product Development
 In addition to Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder), discussed above, we are exploring opportunities for other proprietary products in which inhaled delivery using our ARCUS drug delivery technology can provide a significant therapeutic benefit to patients.
 Disorders of the central nervous system, or CNS, in addition to Parkinson’s disease, may be addressed by ARCUS products with the delivery of active agents to the CNS with rapid onset and reduced systemic exposure. For example, we are currently developing CVT-427, an inhaled triptan (zolmitriptan) intended for acute treatment of migraine by using the ARCUS drug delivery technology. Triptans are the class of drug most commonly prescribed for acute treatment of migraine. Oral triptans, which account for the majority of all triptan doses, can be associated with slow onset of action and gastrointestinal challenges. The slow onset of action, usually 30 minutes or longer, can result in poor response rates. Patients cite the need for rapid relief from migraine symptoms as their most desired medication attribute. Additionally, individuals with migraine may suffer from nausea and delayed gastric emptying which further impact the consistency and efficacy of the oral route of administration. Triptans delivered subcutaneously (injection) provide the most rapid onset of action, but are not convenient for patients. Many triptans are also available in nasally delivered formulations. However, based on available data, we believe that nasally delivered triptans generally have an onset of action similar to orally administered triptans. In December 2016, we completed a special population study to evaluate safe inhalation of CVT-427 in people with asthma and in smokers. Some subjects showed evidence of acute, reversible bronchoconstriction, post-inhalation. We plan to work on reformulating to move the program forward, once we have made more progress on the approval and launch of Inbrija.
 In July 2015, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded us a $1.4 million grant to support the development of a formulation and delivery system for a dry powder version of lung surfactant, a treatment for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, or nRDS. In collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, we developed a novel formulation and delivery device based on our proprietary ARCUS drug delivery technology. nRDS is a condition affecting prematurely born infants in which their lungs are underdeveloped and thus lack a sufficient amount of lung surfactant. It can be fatal, or lead to severe, chronic health issues caused by a lack of oxygen getting to the baby’s brain and other organs. Delivering liquid surfactant to the lungs via intubation is the standard of care. We believe that our formulation and delivery system may present a more practical alternative for use in developing areas of the world, where intubation poses numerous problems. This program is not aimed at developing a commercial product, but our work on this program could potentially generate information that is useful for adapting the ARCUS drug delivery technology to commercial pediatric uses.

We are also beginning to formulate potential ARCUS products for two different rare lung diseases.
 Other Research and Development Programs
 Following is a description of our other research and development programs.
  
• | SYN120: SYN120 is a potential treatment for Parkinson’s-related dementia, which we acquired with Biotie Therapies. Data from a Phase 2 exploratory study that we completed in 2017 showed that several of the outcome measures trended in favor of drug versus placebo, particularly with respect to neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, neither the primary nor key secondary endpoints achieved statistical significance. We are continuing to review the data, which will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | BTT1023: Through Biotie Therapies, we are also developing BTT1023 (timolumab), a product candidate for the orphan disease Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis, or PSC, a chronic and progressive liver disease. There are no approved drug therapies for PSC and liver transplant is the only treatment. Interim data from an ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial of BTT1023 for PSC are expected in the second quarter of 2018.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | rHIgM22: We are developing rHIgM22, a remyelinating antibody, as a potential therapeutic for MS. We believe a therapy that could repair myelin sheaths has the potential to restore neurological function to those affected by demyelinating conditions. A Phase 1 trial using one of two doses of rHIgM22 or placebo in people with MS who are experiencing an acute relapse is clinically complete. In addition to assessing safety and tolerability during an acute relapse, the study includes exploratory efficacy measures such as a timed walk, magnetization transfer ratio imaging of lesion myelination in the brain and various biomarkers. We expect data from the Phase 1 trial in the first quarter of 2018, and we will evaluate our next steps for this program after reviewing the data.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cimaglermin alfa: Cimaglermin alfa is a member of the neuregulin growth factor family, and has been shown to promote recovery after neurological injury, as well as enhance heart function in animal models of heart failure. In 2013, we commenced a Phase 1b single-infusion trial in people with heart failure, which assessed the tolerability of three dose levels of cimaglermin, and also included an assessment of drug-drug interactions and several exploratory measures of efficacy. In 2015 we announced that we had stopped enrollment in this trial based on the occurrence of a case of hepatotoxicity (liver injury) manifested by clinical symptoms and an elevation in liver chemistry tests meeting the FDA Drug-Induced Liver Injury Guidance (FDA 2009) stopping rules. We also received a notification of clinical hold from the FDA following submission of this information. The abnormal blood tests resolved within two to three weeks. We subsequently conducted additional analyses and non-clinical studies to further define the nature of the hepatoxicity, and met with the FDA to present these data as part of our request that the program be removed from the clinical hold. The FDA lifted the clinical hold in April 2017. We are seeking to partner or out-license this program.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 NP-1998 is a Phase 3 ready, 20% prescription strength capsaicin topical solution that we were previously assessing for the treatment of neuropathic pain. In 2013, we acquired development and commercialization rights in the U.S., Canada, Latin America and certain other territories. We believe NP-1998 has the potential to treat multiple neuropathies, but we have not invested in further development of NP-1998 for several years and we are seeking to partner or out-license this program.
 Also, we were previously developing tozadenant, a potential adjunctive treatment to levodopa in Parkinson’s disease patients to reduce OFF time. We acquired this program with our 2016 acquisition of Biotie Therapies. In November 2017, we discontinued our tozadenant clinical development program based on new information obtained from our Phase 3 clinical trials related to agranulocytosis and associated serious adverse events.
 Corporate Update
 In August 2017, our Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights plan to preserve the ability of the Board to protect the interests of stockholders in transactions that may result in an acquisition of control of the Company, including tender offers and open market purchases of our securities. In general terms, the rights plan works by significantly diluting the stock ownership of any person or group that acquires 15% or more of our outstanding common stock without the approval of the Board. The rights plan exempts any person or group owning 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock when we announced the rights plan, however the exemption does not apply to additional shares acquired after the 
 6


announcement. The rights plan also provides, among other things, that when specified events occur, our stockholders will be entitled to purchase from us shares of junior preferred stock. The rights plan will expire on August 31, 2018. The preferred stock purchase rights are triggered ten business days after the date of a public announcement that a person or group acting in concert has acquired, or has obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. The preferred stock purchase rights would cause dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms that are not approved by our Board. While we believe our rights plan enables our Board to help ensure that our stockholders are not deprived of the opportunity to realize the full and fair value of their investments, the rights plan may inhibit a change in control by a third party in a transaction not approved by our Board. If a change in control is inhibited or delayed in this manner, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

* In November 2017, we announced a $40 million Fampyra royalty monetization transaction with HealthCare Royalty Partners, or HCRP. In return for the payment to us, HCRP obtained the right to receive royalties on Fampyra payable to us by Biogen, up to an agreed-upon threshold of royalties. Until this threshold is met, if ever, we will not receive Fampyra royalty revenue although we have retained the right to receive any potential future milestone payments from Biogen.
 
** In November 2017, we announced a royalty monetization with Lundbeck pursuant to which we received a $13 million payment from Lundbeck in exchange for an amendment to its Selincro license eliminating Lundbeck’s future royalty and milestone obligations on sales of Selincro outside of the U.S. Selincro is not approved for use in the U.S. and is not under development for use in the U.S.
 
Background on Neurological Conditions 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. Where our neurology programs may also show promise for disorders outside of the nervous system, we may elect to pursue these opportunistically as well. Currently, we are focused on developing and marketing therapeutics targeted to the conditions described below. We believe there is significant unmet medical need for these conditions, which can severely impact the lives of those who suffer from them.
Multiple Sclerosis
 Multiple Sclerosis, or MS, is a chronic, usually progressive disease in which the immune system attacks and degrades the function of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. These nerve fibers consist of long, thin fibers, or axons, surrounded by a myelin sheath, which facilitates the transmission of electrical impulses, much as insulation facilitates conduction in an electrical wire. In MS, the myelin sheath is damaged by the body's own immune system, causing areas of myelin sheath loss, also known as demyelination. This damage, which can occur at multiple sites in the central nervous system, blocks or diminishes conduction of electrical impulses. Patients with MS may suffer impairments in a wide range of neurological functions. These impairments vary from individual to individual and over the course of time, depending on which parts of the brain and spinal cord are affected, and often include difficulty walking. Individuals vary in the severity of the impairments they suffer on a day-to-day basis, with impairments becoming better or worse depending on the activity of the disease on a given day.
 8


Approximately 400,000 people in the U.S. suffer from MS, and each year approximately 10,000 people in the U.S. are newly diagnosed. In a poll of more than 2,000 people with MS, 87% said they experienced some limitation to their walking ability and limited activities that involved walking. Among MS patients diagnosed within the last 5 years, 58% report experiencing mobility issues at least twice a week. In the European Union, over 700,000 people suffer from MS, and an additional 100,000 people in Canada are also diagnosed with this disease.
 Parkinson’s Disease
 Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the gradual loss of certain neurons responsible for producing dopamine, which causes motor complications, including impaired ability to move, muscle stiffness and tremors. Approximately one million Americans and 1.2 million Europeans suffer from Parkinson’s disease. There is no cure or disease-modifying treatment currently available for Parkinson’s disease. Current treatment strategies are focused on the management and reduction of the major symptoms of the disease and related disabilities. These therapies either aim to supplement dopamine levels in the brain, mimic the effect of dopamine in the brain by stimulating dopamine receptors or prevent the enzymatic breakdown of dopamine. The standard of care for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease symptoms is oral carbidopa/levodopa. Approximately 70% of people with Parkinson’s disease in the U.S. are treated with oral carbidopa/levodopa. Effective control of Parkinson’s disease symptoms is referred to as an ON state.
 As Parkinson’s disease progresses, even optimized regimens of oral carbidopa/levodopa are associated with increasingly wide variability in the timing and amount of absorption into the bloodstream. This results in the unreliable control of symptoms, leading to motor complications including OFF periods. OFF periods, which are characterized by a re-emergence of Parkinson’s disease symptoms, can increase in frequency and severity during the course of the disease. OFF periods remain one of the most challenging aspects of the disease despite optimized regimens with current therapeutic options and strategies. About half of people with Parkinson’s disease treated with L-dopa therapy experience OFF periods within five years of initiating treatment. For the approximately 350,000 people in the U.S. and 420,000 in Europe who experience them, OFF periods are inadequately addressed by available therapies and are considered one of the greatest unmet medical needs facing people with Parkinson’s disease. OFF periods can be very disruptive to the lives of people with Parkinson’s disease, their families and caregivers. In a survey of 3,000 people with Parkinson’s conducted by the Michael J. Fox Foundation, 64% of respondents reporting having at least two hours of OFF time per day.
 According to recent studies following people with Parkinson’s disease over the entire course of their illness, approximately 50-80% may experience dementia. Some studies have reported that the average time from onset of Parkinson’s disease to developing dementia is about 10 years. Dementia is a physical change in the brain that causes a decline in the brain’s ability to process and understand information, and can affect thinking, perception, and mood. As Parkinson’s disease progresses over time, Parkinson’s disease-related dementia can cause problems with: memory loss and forgetfulness; speaking and communicating with others; problem solving and understanding of complex ideas; paying attention; emotional control, mood, and motivation; confusion, anxiety, and hallucinations.
 Migraine
 Migraine is a neurological syndrome characterized by pain, nausea, abnormal sensitivity to sound and abnormal sensitivity to light. It is believed to affect over 10% of the global population. In the U.S., the National Institutes of Health estimates 12% of the population, or approximately 37 million people, suffer from migraine, with women being nearly three times more affected than men. Triptans are the class of drug most commonly prescribed for acute treatment of migraine. Oral triptans, which account for the majority of all triptan doses, can be associated with slow onset of action and gastrointestinal challenges. The slow onset of action, usually 30 minutes or longer, can result in poor response rates. Patients cite the need for rapid relief from migraine symptoms as their most desired medication attribute. Additionally, individuals with migraine may suffer from nausea and delayed gastric emptying which further impact the consistency and efficacy of the oral route of administration. Triptans delivered subcutaneously (injection) provide the most rapid onset of action, but are not convenient for patients. Many triptans are also available in nasally delivered formulations. However, based on available data, we believe that nasally delivered triptans generally have an onset of action similar to orally administered triptans.
Ampyra
 Ampyra (dalfampridine) is an oral drug approved by the FDA on January 22, 2010 as a treatment to improve walking in patients with MS. This was demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. Ampyra demonstrated efficacy in people with all four major types of MS (relapsing remitting, secondary progressive, progressive relapsing and primary progressive). Ampyra can be used alone or with concurrent medications, including immunomodulatory drugs. The majority of patients in 
 9


our two Phase 3 clinical trials for Ampyra (63%) were taking immunomodulatory drugs (interferons, glatiramer acetate, or natalizumab). Ampyra is an extended release tablet formulation of dalfampridine (4-aminopyridine, 4-AP), which was previously referred to as fampridine.
 We have five issued patents listed in the Orange Book for Ampyra, which are described below in the “Intellectual Property” section of this report. In March 2017, we announced a decision by the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in litigation with certain generic drug manufacturers upholding our Ampyra Orange Book-listed patent set to expire on July 30, 2018, but invalidating our four other Orange Book-listed patents pertaining to Ampyra that were set to expire between 2025 and 2027. Under this decision, we expect to maintain patent exclusivity with respect to Ampyra at least through July 30, 2018, depending on the outcome of appeal of the District Court’s decision. The defendant generic drug manufacturers with whom we have not reached settlements have appealed the District Court’s decision upholding the patent that expires in July 2018, and we have appealed the ruling on the four invalidated patents. We expect the appeals process to take approximately 12 to 18 months from the filing of the appeal in May 2017. Both the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) filed amicus briefs in support of our appeal, raising important issues in conjunction with biopharmaceutical innovation. The date for oral argument will be scheduled by the appellate court, which we expect will be in the first half of 2018. We expect to experience a rapid and significant decline in Ampyra sales beyond July 2018 due to competition from generic versions of Ampyra that may be marketed after the expiration of our remaining Ampyra patent, unless the District Court’s decision on the four invalidated patents is overturned on appeal, which could include reversal or remand by the appeals court back to the District Court. If the appeals court does not overturn the District Court’s decision by July 30, 2018, multiple ANDA filers may be able to launch generic versions of Ampyra absent injunctive relief.
 Ampyra is marketed as Fampyra outside the U.S. by Biogen under a 2009 license and collaboration agreement. Fampyra has been approved in a number of countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas.
 Background
 Dalfampridine is a potassium channel blocker. In animal studies, dalfampridine has been shown to increase conduction of nerve signals in demyelinated axons through blocking of potassium channels. The mechanism by which dalfampridine exerts its therapeutic effect has not been fully elucidated.
Clinical Studies and Safety Profile
 Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for Ampyra was based on data from a comprehensive development program assessing the safety and efficacy of Ampyra, including two Phase 3 trials that involved 540 people with MS. The primary measure of efficacy in our two Phase 3 MS trials was walking speed (in feet per second) as measured by the Timed 25-foot Walk (T25FW), using a responder analysis. A responder was defined as a patient who showed faster walking speed for at least three visits out of a possible four during the double-blind period than the maximum speed achieved in the five non-double-blind, no treatment visits (four before the double-blind period and one after). A significantly greater proportion of patients taking Ampyra 10 mg twice daily were responders compared to patients taking placebo, as measured by the T25FW (Trial 1: 34.8% vs. 8.3%; Trial 2: 42.9% vs. 9.3%). The increased response rate in the Ampyra group was observed across all four major types of MS. During the double-blind treatment period, a significantly greater proportion of patients taking Ampyra 10 mg twice daily had increases in walking speed of at least 10%, 20%, or 30% from baseline, compared to placebo. In both trials, the consistent improvements in walking speed were shown to be associated with improvements on a patient self-assessment of ambulatory disability, the 12 item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12), for both drug and placebo treated patients. However, a drug vs. placebo difference was not established for that outcome measure.
 In October 2015, we presented 5-year post-marketing safety data for dalfampridine extended release tablets in MS at the 31st Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) annual meeting. The data presented continue to be consistent with those reported in double-blind clinical trials, with incidence of reported seizure remaining stable over time.
 10


The FDA’s approval letter included certain post-marketing study requirements and confirmed certain commitments made by us with respect to Ampyra, all of which we have now completed. The post-marketing requirements included additional animal toxicology studies to evaluate certain impurities, in-vitro receptor binding and abuse potential studies in animals, and an evaluation of clinical adverse events related to abuse potential. We completed these studies and timely submitted the results to the FDA. Also, we committed to the FDA that we would conduct a placebo-controlled trial to evaluate a 5 mg twice-daily dosing regimen of Ampyra, as well as a pharmacokinetic evaluation of a 7.5 mg dosage strength in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. We also committed to report all post-marketing seizure events on an expedited basis to the FDA. We completed the renal impairment study and timely submitted the results to the FDA, but the FDA may require additional studies. In August 2012, we announced results of the 5mg efficacy study. The study failed to confirm efficacy of the 5mg dose. We believe that this study, together with Ampyra registration studies, continue to show that 10mg twice daily is the appropriate, safe, and effective dose. The study results were provided to the FDA, which subsequently confirmed that we have satisfied this post-marketing requirement.
 In our two Phase 3 clinical studies of Ampyra in spinal cord injury, which were completed in 2004, the results did not reach statistical significance on their primary endpoints.
 Qutenza
 Qutenza is a dermal patch containing 8% prescription strength capsaicin the effects of which can last up to three months and is approved by the FDA for the management of neuropathic pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia, also known as post-shingles pain. We acquired commercialization rights to Qutenza in July 2013 from NeurogesX, Inc. These rights include the U.S., Canada, Latin America and certain other territories. Grunenthal GmbH (as the assignee of Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd.) has exclusive commercialization rights for Qutenza in the European Economic Area (EEA) including the 28 countries of the European Union, Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein as well as Switzerland, certain countries in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
 Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder)/Parkinson’s Disease
 Inbrija is a self-administered, inhaled formulation of levodopa, or L-dopa, for the treatment of OFF periods in people with Parkinson’s disease who are taking a carbidopa/levodopa regimen. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the gradual loss of certain neurons in the brain responsible for producing dopamine. The disease causes a range of symptoms such as impaired ability to move, muscle stiffness and tremor. The standard of care for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease is oral carbidopa/levodopa, but oral medication can be associated with wide variability in the timing and amount of absorption and there are significant challenges in creating a regimen that consistently maintains therapeutic effects as Parkinson’s disease progresses. The re-emergence of symptoms is referred to as an OFF period, and despite optimized regimens with current therapeutic options and strategies, OFF periods remain one of the most challenging aspects of the disease.
 Inbrija delivers a precise dose of dry-powder formulation of L-dopa to the lung using a breath-actuated proprietary inhaler. Oral medication can be associated with slow and variable onset of action, as the medicine is absorbed through the gastrointestinal (digestive) tract before reaching the brain. Inhaled treatments enter the body through the lungs and reach the brain shortly thereafter, bypassing the digestive system. Inbrija is based on our proprietary ARCUS platform, a dry-powder pulmonary drug delivery technology that we believe has potential applications in multiple disease areas. A key feature of our ARCUS technology is the large porous particles that allow for consistent and precise delivery of significantly larger doses of medication than are possible with conventional dry powder pulmonary systems. This in turn provides the potential for pulmonary delivery of a much wider variety of pharmaceutical agents. We have worldwide rights to our ARCUS drug delivery technology, which is protected by extensive know-how and trade secrets and various U.S. and foreign patents, including patents that protect the Inbrija dry powder capsules beyond 2030.
 In 2016, we completed a Phase 3 efficacy and safety clinical trial of Inbrija for the treatment of OFF periods in Parkinson’s disease. In February 2017, we announced efficacy and safety data from this clinical trial, showing a statistically significant improvement in motor function in people with Parkinson’s experiencing OFF periods. The clinical trial had three arms: Inbrija 84 mg and 60 mg doses (equivalent to 50 mg and 35 mg fine particle doses, respectively), and placebo. The trial met its primary outcome measure of improvement in motor function as measured by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale-Part 3 (UPDRS Part III) in people with Parkinson’s experiencing OFF periods. UPDRS III is a validated scale, which measures Parkinson’s disease motor impairment. The primary endpoint was measured at 30 minutes post-treatment for the 84 mg dose at the 12-week visit. UPDRS Part III change was -9.83 compared to -5.91 for placebo with a p value of 0.009. The 
 11


magnitude of Inbrija’s benefit versus baseline was consistent with the data from the prior Phase 2b clinical trial, further described below, and represents a statistically significant, clinically meaningful improvement in motor function. The placebo-adjusted difference was lower in the Phase 3 clinical trial than the Phase 2b clinical trial but still represented a clinically important difference. In June 2017, we announced additional data from the Inbrija Phase 3 efficacy and safety trial at the International Congress of Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders (MDS). The secondary endpoints of achievement of an ON state with maintenance through 60 minutes (statistically significant), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and reduction in UPDRS III score at 10 minutes were supportive of the primary endpoint result.
 The safety profile of Inbrija in the trial was consistent with that observed in a prior Phase 2b clinical trial:
  
• | 84 mg, 60 mg and Placebo: Adverse events reported in any study arm at greater than 5% were cough, upper respiratory tract infection, throat irritation, nausea and sputum discoloration. Cough was the most common adverse event, reported by approximately 15% of subjects who received Inbrija. When reported, it was typically mild and reported once per participant during the course of treatment. Three of 227 participants receiving Inbrija discontinued the study due to cough. Reports of serious adverse events were: 3, or 2.7% in the placebo arm, 6, or 5.3% in the 60 mg arm, and 2, or 1.8% in the 84 mg arm. There was one death in the study, a suicide in the 60 mg group, judged by the investigator not to be related to drug.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 84 mg: The most commonly reported adverse events in the Inbrija 84 mg group compared to the placebo group were: cough (14.9% vs. 1.8%, reported mostly once/subject), upper respiratory tract infection (6.1% vs. 2.7%), nausea (5.3% vs. 2.7%), sputum discoloration (5.3% vs. 0%) and dyskinesia (3.5% vs. 0.0%). When cough was reported, it was typically characterized as mild. Two of 114 participants receiving Inbrija 84 mg discontinued the study due to cough.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Results from a separate Phase 3 study to assess the long-term safety profile of Inbrija in people with Parkinson’s showed no statistical difference in pulmonary function between the group receiving Inbrija and an observational control group. These results are consistent with the previously reported Phase 2b and Phase 3 clinical trials. In March 2017, we announced results from separate clinical studies that assessed the safety profile of Inbrija in people with asthma, smokers and early morning OFF.
 In June 2017, we submitted an NDA for Inbrija to the FDA. In August 2017, we announced that we received a Refusal to File, or RTF, letter from the FDA regarding the Inbrija NDA. Upon its preliminary review, the FDA determined that the NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. The FDA specified two reasons for the RTF: first, the date when the manufacturing site would be ready for inspection; and second, a question regarding the submission of the drug master production record. The FDA also requested additional information at resubmission, which was not part of the basis for the RTF. We resubmitted the NDA in December 2017. The resubmission addressed the two issues raised in the RTF and included all additional information requested by the FDA in the RTF. On February 20, 2018, we announced that the resubmitted NDA was accepted for filing by the FDA, and that under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has set a target date of October 5, 2018. The NDA was submitted under section 505(b)(2) of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, referencing data from the branded L-dopa product Sinemet®. We believe the Phase 3 efficacy and safety clinical trial, combined with data from additional Phase 3 long-term safety studies and supported by existing Phase 2b data, are sufficient for the NDA filing. Our commercial preparations for the launch of Inbrija continue. We believe we have built a leading neuro-specialty sales and marketing team through our commercialization of Ampyra, and that our commercial launch of Inbrija in the U.S., if approved, will benefit from the experiences and capabilities of this team. We are projecting that, if approved, annual peak net revenue of Inbrija in the U.S. alone could exceed $800 million. We expect to file a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency in the first quarter of 2018. We are in discussions with potential partners regarding Inbrija outside of the U.S.
 In June 2015, we presented data from a Phase 2b clinical trial of Inbrija at the 19th International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders (MDS). The data showed that patients experiencing an OFF period, treated with Inbrija, experienced significantly greater improvements in motor function than patients treated with an inhaled placebo; the difference in improvement was already apparent 10 minutes after dosing and was durable for at least an hour, the longest time point at which patients were measured. In April 2016, data from this clinical trial were one of six platform presentations highlighted during the Movement Disorders Invited Science Session at the 68th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology. In June 2016, data from this clinical trial was also presented in three posters during the 20th International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders (MDS). In October 2016, we announced that results from Phase 1, Phase 2a and preclinical studies of Inbrija were featured in the current edition of Science Translational Medicine.

ARCUS Product Development
 In addition to Inbrija, discussed above, we are exploring opportunities for other proprietary products in which inhaled delivery using our ARCUS drug delivery technology can provide a significant therapeutic benefit to patients.
 Disorders of the central nervous system, or CNS, in addition to Parkinson’s disease, may be addressed by ARCUS products with the delivery of active agents to the CNS with rapid onset and reduced systemic exposure. For example, we are currently developing CVT-427, an inhaled triptan (zolmitriptan) intended for acute treatment of migraine by using the ARCUS drug delivery technology. Triptans are the class of drug most commonly prescribed for acute treatment of migraine. Oral triptans, which account for the majority of all triptan doses, can be associated with slow onset of action and gastrointestinal challenges. The slow onset of action, usually 30 minutes or longer, can result in poor response rates. Patients cite the need for rapid relief from migraine symptoms as their most desired medication attribute. Additionally, individuals with migraine may suffer from nausea and delayed gastric emptying which further impact the consistency and efficacy of the oral route of administration. Triptans delivered subcutaneously (injection) provide the most rapid onset of action, but are not convenient for patients. Many triptans are also available in nasally delivered formulations. However, based on available data, we believe that nasally delivered triptans generally have an onset of action similar to orally administered triptans.
 In December 2015, we initiated and completed a Phase 1 safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetic clinical trial of CVT-427 for acute treatment of migraine. In June 2016, at the 58th Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Headache Society, we presented pharmacokinetic data from the Phase 1 trial which showed increased bioavailability and faster absorption compared to oral and nasal administration of the same active ingredient in healthy adults. In particular, the data showed that CVT-427 had a median Tmax of about 12 minutes for all dose levels compared to 1.5 hours for the oral tablet and 3.0 hours for the nasal spray. There were no serious adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities, evidence of bronchoconstriction or discontinuations due to adverse events reported in this study. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events were cough, chest discomfort, headache, and feeling hot. Apart from cough, single dose CVT-427 tolerability was generally consistent with the known safety profile of zolmitriptan. In December 2016, we completed a special population study to evaluate safe inhalation of CVT-427 in people with asthma and in smokers. Some subjects showed evidence of acute, reversible bronchoconstriction, post-inhalation. We plan to work on reformulating CVT-427 to move the program forward, once we have made more progress on the approval and launch of Inbrija.
 In July 2015, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded us a $1.4 million grant to support the development of a formulation and delivery system for a dry powder version of lung surfactant, a treatment for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, or nRDS. In collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, we developed a novel formulation and delivery device based on our proprietary ARCUS drug delivery technology. nRDS is a condition affecting prematurely born infants in which their lungs are underdeveloped and thus lack a sufficient amount of lung surfactant. It can be fatal, or lead to severe, chronic health issues caused by a lack of oxygen getting to the baby’s brain and other organs. Delivering liquid surfactant to the lungs via intubation is the standard of care. We believe that our formulation and delivery system may present a more practical alternative for use in developing areas of the world, where intubation poses numerous problems. This program is not aimed at developing a commercial product, but our work on this program could potentially generate information that is useful for adapting the ARCUS drug delivery technology to commercial pediatric uses.
 We are also beginning to formulate potential ARCUS products for two different rare lung diseases.
 Other Research and Development Programs 
 Following is a description of our other research and development programs.
  
• | SYN120: SYN120 is a potential treatment for Parkinson’s-related dementia, which we acquired with Biotie Therapies. Data from a Phase 2 exploratory study that we completed in 2017 showed that several of the outcome measures trended in favor of drug versus placebo, particularly with respect to neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, neither the primary nor key secondary endpoints achieved statistical significance. We are continuing to review the data, which will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | BTT1023: Through Biotie Therapies, we are also developing BTT1023 (timolumab), a product candidate for the orphan disease Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis, or PSC, a chronic and progressive liver disease. There are no approved drug therapies for PSC and liver transplant is the only treatment. Interim data from an ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial of BTT1023 for PSC are expected in the second quarter of 2018.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13


 
• | rHIgM22: We are developing rHIgM22, a remyelinating antibody, as a potential therapeutic for MS. We believe a therapy that could repair myelin sheaths has the potential to restore neurological function to those affected by demyelinating conditions. A Phase 1 trial using one of two doses of rHIgM22 or placebo in people with MS who are experiencing an acute relapse is clinically complete. In addition to assessing safety and tolerability during an acute relapse, the study includes exploratory efficacy measures such as a timed walk, magnetization transfer ratio imaging of lesion myelination in the brain and various biomarkers. We expect data from the Phase 1 trial in the first quarter of 2018, and we will evaluate our next steps for this program after reviewing the data.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cimaglermin alfa: Cimaglermin alfa is a member of the neuregulin growth factor family, and has been shown to promote recovery after neurological injury, as well as enhance heart function in animal models of heart failure. In 2013, we commenced a Phase 1b single-infusion trial in people with heart failure, which assessed the tolerability of three dose levels of cimaglermin, and also included an assessment of drug-drug interactions and several exploratory measures of efficacy. In 2015 we announced that we had stopped enrollment in this trial based on the occurrence of a case of hepatotoxicity (liver injury) manifested by clinical symptoms and an elevation in liver chemistry tests meeting the FDA Drug-Induced Liver Injury Guidance (FDA 2009) stopping rules. We also received a notification of clinical hold from the FDA following submission of this information. The abnormal blood tests resolved within two to three weeks. We subsequently conducted additional analyses and non-clinical studies to further define the nature of the hepatoxicity, and met with the FDA to present these data as part of our request that the program be removed from the clinical hold. The FDA lifted the clinical hold in April 2017. We are seeking to partner or out-license this program.

 NP-1998 is a Phase 3 ready, 20% prescription strength capsaicin topical solution that we were previously assessing for the treatment of neuropathic pain. In 2013, we acquired development and commercialization rights in the U.S., Canada, Latin America and certain other territories. We believe NP-1998 has the potential to treat multiple neuropathies, but we have not invested in further development of NP-1998 for several years and we are seeking to partner or out-license this program.
 Also, we were previously developing tozadenant, a potential adjunctive treatment to levodopa in Parkinson’s disease patients to reduce OFF time. We acquired this program with our 2016 acquisition of Biotie Therapies. In November 2017, we discontinued our tozadenant clinical development program based on new information obtained from our Phase 3 clinical trials related to agranulocytosis and associated serious adverse events.
 Sales, Marketing and Market Access
 Ampyra
 Since the March 2010 launch of Ampyra, approximately 130,000 people with MS in the U.S. have tried Ampyra. We believe that Ampyra is increasingly considered by many physicians a standard of care to improve walking in adults with MS. Eight years after approval, Ampyra continues to grow, reflecting the continued unmet medical need among adults with MS for a treatment to improve walking. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 70% of all people with MS who were prescribed Ampyra received a first refill, and approximately 40% of all people with MS who were prescribed Ampyra have been dispensed at least six months of the medicine through refills, consistent with previously reported trends. These refill rates exclude patients who started Ampyra through our 60-day free trial program. Our 60-day free trial program provides eligible patients with two months of Ampyra at no cost. During 2017, on average, approximately 80% of new Ampyra patients enrolled in 60-day free trial. The program is in its seventh year, and data show that 60-day free trial participants have higher compliance and persistency rates over time compared to patients not in the program. Approximately 50% of patients who initiate therapy with the 60-day free trial free trial program convert to paid prescriptions.
 We have established our own specialty sales force and commercial infrastructure in the U.S. to market Ampyra. We currently have approximately 90 sales representatives in the field calling on a priority target list of approximately 7,000 physicians. We also have established teams of Medical Science Liaisons, Regional Reimbursement Directors, and Market Access Account Directors who provide information and assistance to payers and physicians on Ampyra; a National Trade Account Director who works with our limited network of specialty pharmacies; and Market Development Managers who work collaboratively with field teams and corporate personnel to assist in the execution of our strategic initiatives.
 We have contracted with a third-party organization with extensive experience in coordinating patient benefits to run Ampyra Patient Support Services, or APSS, a dedicated resource of support services that coordinates the prescription process among healthcare providers, people with MS and insurance carriers. Prescriptions for Ampyra are processed through the APSS center, where dedicated and experienced customer care agents are responsible for helping healthcare professionals 
 14


process prescriptions; working with insurance carriers to facilitate coverage; and working with a limited network of specialty pharmacy providers that deliver the medication directly to a patient’s home. In addition, APSS assists in directing patients to available copay and patient assistance programs, where permitted by law. The process begins when a prescription is submitted by a physician to APSS through a Service Request Form, or SRF. Processing of most incoming requests for prescriptions by APSS begins within 24 hours of receipt. Patients will experience a range of times to receive their first shipment based on the processing times for insurance requirements. As with any prescription product, patients who are members of benefit plans that have restrictive prior authorizations may experience delays in receiving their prescription. If insurance coverage is confirmed, APSS will transmit the prescription information to the specialty pharmacy provider that has contracted with the patient’s insurance carrier. The specialty pharmacy provider will then mail the prescription directly to the patient. In some cases, the specialty pharmacy provider will coordinate the insurance benefits investigation on behalf of the patient or will receive a prescription directly from a prescribing physician. Also we have established a program to assist individuals who have private insurance in managing their copayment costs through a copay mitigation program, where permitted by law.
 We believe that, in general, people with MS are knowledgeable about their conditions, actively seek new treatments, and are directly involved with their prescriber's evaluation of treatment options. We have existing relationships with the major advocacy groups that focus on MS. As an example of our commitment, each year Acorda sponsors numerous National Multiple Sclerosis Society's Walk MS events around the country. These sponsorships allow us to engage thousands of people with MS, as well as their families, physicians and caregivers, in a discussion about the impact of walking impairment on their lives. In addition to these efforts, we have implemented educational and promotional programs to support Ampyra.
 Ampyra is distributed in the U.S. exclusively through a limited network of specialty pharmacy providers that deliver the medication to patients by mail; Kaiser Permanente, which distributes Ampyra to patients through a closed network of on-site pharmacies; and ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc. (an AmerisourceBergen affiliate), which distributes Ampyra to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, and other federal agencies. The distribution process through specialty pharmacy providers is well established within the MS community, and physicians and patients are familiar with this model. This distribution process is intended to provide the best possible patient experience, improve patient adherence to the required drug regimen, including dosage, and assist in educating patients regarding the risks associated with Ampyra. The specialty pharmacy providers that deliver Ampyra by mail, and Kaiser Permanente, are contractually obligated to hold no more than 20 days of inventory, and some have agreed to hold a minimum of 8 to 10 business days of inventory. Three of the largest national health plans in the U.S. – Aetna, Cigna and United Healthcare – have listed Ampyra on their commercial formulary. Approximately 75% of insured individuals in the U.S. continue to have no or limited prior authorizations, or PA’s, for Ampyra. We define limited PAs as those that require only an MS diagnosis, documentation of no contraindications, and/or simple documentation that the patient has a walking impairment; such documentation may include a Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25W) test. The access figure is calculated based on the number of pharmacy lives reported by health plans.
 Qutenza
 Qutenza is distributed in the U.S. by Besse Medical, Inc., a specialty distributor that furnishes the medication to physician offices, and by ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc., a specialty distributor that furnishes the medication to hospitals and clinics. As a product that must be administered only by a health care professional in an office, clinic, or hospital setting, many commercial health plans and government insurance programs reimburse for Qutenza under the patient’s medical benefit rather than the patient’s pharmacy benefit. As a result of this, most utilization of Qutenza is handled on a “buy-and-bill” basis in which one of the distributors listed above (Besse Medical, Inc. or ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc.) ships the medication to a physician’s office, hospital or clinic to be administered. In those limited number of cases where a payer covers the medication under a patient’s pharmacy benefit, a specialty pharmacy purchases Qutenza from ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc., and then ships the medication directly to the physician’s office, rather than dispensing Qutenza to the patient.
 Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder)
 We believe we have built a leading neuro-specialty sales and marketing team through our commercialization of Ampyra, and that our launch of Inbrija in the U.S., if approved, will benefit from the experiences and capabilities of this team.

Material and Other Collaborations and License Agreements
 Biogen (Fampyra)
 In 2009, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Biogen, pursuant to which we and Biogen have agreed to collaborate on the development and commercialization of products containing aminopyridines, including Ampyra, initially directed to the treatment of MS (licensed products). The Collaboration Agreement includes a sublicense of our rights under an existing license agreement with Alkermes (formerly Elan). We have also entered into a related Supply Agreement pursuant to which we supply Biogen with its requirements for the licensed products through our existing supply agreement with Alkermes. Biogen Inc., the parent of Biogen, has guaranteed the performance of Biogen's obligations under the Collaboration Agreement and the Supply Agreement.
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, Biogen, itself or through its affiliates, has the exclusive right to commercialize licensed products in all countries outside of the U.S., while we retain the exclusive right to commercialize licensed products in the U.S. Each party has the exclusive right to develop licensed products for its commercialization territory, although the parties may also decide to jointly carry out mutually agreed future development activities under a cost-sharing arrangement. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we participate in overseeing the development and commercialization of Ampyra and other licensed products in markets outside the U.S. in part through our participation in joint committees with Biogen. If Biogen does not participate in the development of licensed products for certain indications or forms of administration, it may lose the right to develop and commercialize the licensed products for such indication or form of administration. Biogen may sublicense its rights to certain unaffiliated distributors. During the term of the Collaboration Agreement and for two years after the Collaboration Agreement terminates, neither party nor its affiliates may, other than pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, research, develop, manufacture or commercialize any competing product, defined as one that contains aminopyridine or any other compound that acts at least in part through direct interaction with potassium channels to improve neurological function in MS, SCI or other demyelinating conditions, except that we may exploit the licensed products anywhere in the world following termination of the Collaboration Agreement.
 Ampyra is marketed as Fampyra outside the U.S. by Biogen. Fampyra has been approved in a number of countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas.
 In consideration for the rights granted to Biogen under the Collaboration Agreement, we were entitled to a non-refundable upfront payment of $110.0 million as of June 30, 2009, which was received in July 2009. Also, in August 2011, we received a $25 million milestone payment from Biogen for approval of Fampyra in the EU. Under our separate license and supply agreements with Alkermes, in 2009 we paid Alkermes $7.7 million of the $110 million upfront Biogen payment and in 2011 we paid Alkermes $1.8 million of the $25 million Biogen milestone payment. We are entitled to receive additional payments from Biogen of up to $10 million based on the successful achievement of future regulatory milestones and up to $365 million based on the successful achievement of future sales milestones. The next expected milestone payment from Biogen would be $15 million, due when ex-U.S. net sales exceed $100 million over four consecutive quarters.
 Under the Collaboration Agreement, we are also entitled to receive double-digit tiered royalties on sales of licensed products by Biogen, its affiliates or certain distributors outside of the U.S. Such royalties for products combining a licensed compound with at least one other clinically active therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic ingredient are determined based on the contribution of the licensed compound to the overall sales or value of the combination product. Biogen may offset against the royalties payable to us a portion of certain royalties that it may need to pay to third parties. In November 2017, we announced a $40 million Fampyra royalty monetization transaction with HealthCare Royalty Partners, or HCRP. In return for the payment to us, HCRP obtained the right to receive these Fampyra royalties up to an agreed-upon threshold. Until this threshold is met, if ever, we will not receive Fampyra royalty revenue although we have retained the right to receive any potential future milestone payments, described above.
 Biogen exclusively purchases all of Biogen's, its affiliates' and its sublicensees' requirements of the licensed products from us. The purchase price paid by Biogen for licensed products under the Collaboration Agreement and Supply Agreement reflects the prices owed to our suppliers under our supply arrangements with Alkermes or other suppliers. In addition, Biogen pays us, in consideration for its purchase and sale of the licensed products, any amounts due to Alkermes for ex-U.S. sales, including royalties owed under the terms of our existing agreements with Alkermes.
 The Collaboration Agreement will terminate upon the expiration of Biogen's royalty payment obligations, which occurs, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, upon the latest of expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering a licensed product, fifteen years following first commercial sale of such licensed product, the 
 16


expiration of regulatory exclusivity and the existence of certain levels of sales by competing products. The Collaboration Agreement and the Supply Agreement will automatically terminate upon the termination of our license agreement with Alkermes in its entirety or with respect to all countries outside of the U.S. We cannot terminate our license agreement with Alkermes without Biogen's prior written consent under certain circumstances. Biogen may terminate the Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis at any time upon 180 days' prior written notice, subject to our right to accelerate such termination. The Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by either party if the other party fails to cure a material breach under the agreement, which termination will be limited to a particular country or region under certain circumstances. However, if Biogen has the right to terminate the Collaboration Agreement due to our material uncured breach, Biogen may instead elect to keep the agreement in effect, but decrease the royalty rates they pay us by a specified percentage. We may also terminate the Collaboration Agreement if Biogen does not commercially launch a licensed product within a specified time period after receiving regulatory approval for such licensed product or otherwise fails to meet certain commercialization obligations. In addition, we may terminate the Collaboration Agreement under certain circumstances if (i) Biogen, its affiliates or its sublicensees challenge certain of our patents or (ii) there is a change in control of Biogen or its parent company or certain dispositions of assets by Biogen, its parent or its affiliated companies, followed by a change in the sales and marketing personnel responsible for the licensed products in Biogen's territory of more than a specified percentage within a certain period of time after such change in control or disposition. The Supply Agreement may be terminated by either party if the other party fails to cure a material breach under the Supply Agreement. In addition, the Supply Agreement will terminate automatically upon termination of the Collaboration Agreement, and the Collaboration Agreement will terminate automatically if the Supply Agreement is terminated for any reason other than for a material breach that we are responsible for. To the extent permitted by law, each party may terminate the Collaboration Agreement and the Supply Agreement if the other party is subject to bankruptcy proceedings.
 If the Supply Agreement is terminated by Biogen for an uncured material breach, we will waive our right for Alkermes to exclusively supply the licensed products to us solely to permit Biogen to negotiate terms with Alkermes for the supply of licensed products to Biogen. If the Supply Agreement is otherwise terminated, Biogen will not have any future obligations to purchase licensed products from us and we will not have any future obligations to supply Biogen with licensed products. If the Collaboration Agreement is terminated, Biogen will assign to us all regulatory documentation and other information necessary or useful to exploit the licensed products in the terminated countries and will grant us a license under Biogen's and its affiliates' relevant patent rights, know-how and trademarks to exploit the licensed products in the terminated countries. Such assignment and license will be at no cost to us unless the Collaboration Agreement is terminated by Biogen for a material uncured breach that we are responsible for, in which case the parties will negotiate a payment to Biogen to reflect the net value of such assigned and licensed rights.
 Neither party may assign the agreements without the prior written consent of the other, except to an affiliate or, in certain cases, to a third party acquirer of the party.
 In connection with the entry into the Collaboration Agreement, Biogen and Alkermes entered into a Consent Agreement with us. Under the Consent Agreement, Alkermes consented to our sublicense of rights to Biogen, and the three parties agreed to set up a committee to coordinate activities under our agreements with Alkermes with respect to the development, supply and commercialization of the licensed products for Biogen's territory. The Consent Agreement also amended our agreements with Alkermes by, among other things, permitting us to allow Biogen to grant sublicenses to certain unaffiliated distributors; permitting us to allow Biogen to package the licensed products and to work directly with Alkermes with respect to certain supply-related activities; and, requiring Alkermes to facilitate the qualification of an alternate supplier of the licensed products under certain circumstances.
 Alkermes (Ampyra)
 We have entered into agreements with Elan Corporation plc, including those described immediately below and elsewhere in this report. In September 2011, Alkermes plc acquired Elan’s Drug Technologies business and Elan transferred our agreements to Alkermes as part of that transaction. Throughout this report, references to “Alkermes” include Alkermes plc and also, as the context may require, Elan Corporation plc as the predecessor to Alkermes plc under our agreements.
 In September 2003, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Elan that replaced two prior license agreements for Ampyra in oral sustained release dosage form. Under this agreement, Elan granted us exclusive worldwide rights to Ampyra for all indications, including SCI, MS and all other indications. We agreed to pay Elan milestone payments of up to $15.0 million, of which we have reached and paid $5.0 million, and royalties based on net sales of products with dalfampridine as the active ingredient. We also agreed to pay Elan 7% of any upfront and milestone payments that we receive from the sublicensing of rights to Ampyra or other aminopyridine products. As a result of our Collaboration 
 17


Agreement with Biogen, described above, in 2009 we paid Elan $7.7 million of a $110 million upfront payment we received from Biogen, and in 2011 we paid Elan $1.8 million of a $25 million milestone payment we received from Biogen.
 Alkermes (now the licensor under this agreement due to its 2011 acquisition of Elan’s Drug Technologies business) is also obligated under this agreement to supply us with our commercial requirements for Ampyra in the U.S., as well as to supply Biogen under the Supply Agreement and Consent Agreement with Fampyra for Biogen’s clinical trials and for Biogen’s commercial requirements.
 Alkermes may terminate our license in countries in which we have a license, if we fail to file for regulatory approvals within a commercially reasonable time after completion and receipt of positive data from all preclinical and clinical studies required for the related NDA equivalent. We could also lose our rights under the license agreement if we fail to launch a product in such countries within 180 days of NDA or equivalent approval and receipt of other needed regulatory approvals, or if we fail to fulfill our payment obligations under the license agreement. If Alkermes terminates our license in any applicable country, Alkermes is entitled to license from us our patent rights and know-how relating to the product and to market the product in the applicable country, subject to royalty payments to us.
 We have the right to terminate the Alkermes license at any time by written notice. In addition, the Alkermes license may be immediately terminated by either party following an incurable breach of any term or provision by the other party. The Alkermes license may also be terminated by either party following notice and the expiration of a cure period with respect to an uncured breach by either party.
 Subject to the early termination provisions, the Alkermes license terminates on a country-by-country basis on the last to occur of fifteen years from the date of the agreement (2018), the expiration of the last to expire Alkermes patent or the existence of competition in that country.
 Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center (dalfampridine)
 In 1990, Elan licensed from Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center, or Rush, know-how relating to dalfampridine for the treatment of MS. We subsequently licensed this know-how from Elan. In September 2003, we entered into an agreement with Rush and Elan terminating the Rush license to Elan and providing for mutual releases. We also entered into a license agreement with Rush in 2003 in which Rush granted us an exclusive worldwide license to its know-how relating to dalfampridine for the treatment of MS.
 We agreed to pay Rush a license fee, milestone payments of up to $1.1 million and royalties based on net sales of the product for neurological indications. We have made or accrued an aggregate of $1.1 in milestone payments and $59.9 million in royalties under this agreement through December 31, 2017. In 2014, with our consent Rush sold its right to receive these royalties along with certain related rights to a third party, though this transfer did not materially change any of our obligations under the license. The FDA approval of Ampyra triggered the final milestone of $750,000, which was paid in 2010. The Rush license may be terminated by either party following an uncured material breach by the other party and notice. The Rush license may also be terminated upon the filing or institution of bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership proceedings, or upon an assignment of a substantial portion of the assets for the benefit of creditors by the other party. We also entered into an agreement with Elan relating to the allocation of payments between us and Elan of certain payments to Rush under the Rush license. Subject to the early termination provisions, the Rush license terminates upon expiration of the royalty obligations, which expire fifteen years from the date of the agreement (2018).
 Alkermes (ARCUS products)
 On December 27, 2010, Civitas, our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into an Asset Purchase and License Agreement with Alkermes, Inc. pursuant to which Alkermes assigned, sold and transferred to Civitas certain of its rights in certain pulmonary delivery patents and patents applications, certain equipment and instruments relating to pulmonary drug delivery, copies of certain documents and reports relating to pulmonary delivery, certain pulmonary drug delivery inhalers and certain pulmonary drug delivery INDs filed with the FDA. Alkermes also granted to Civitas a non-exclusive sublicense to know-how for the purpose of development and commercialization of ARCUS products. Civitas is permitted to license and sublicense the pulmonary patents, patent applications and know-how, subject to certain restrictions, as necessary for our business. Without the prior written consent of Alkermes, Civitas is prohibited from assigning the intellectual property acquired from Alkermes, except to an affiliate or to a person that acquires all or substantially all of its business to which the agreement relates, whether by acquisition, sale, merger or otherwise.
 18


Civitas is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop ARCUS products. Civitas is obligated to pay to Alkermes royalties for each licensed product. For licensed products sold by Civitas or an affiliate, Civitas will pay Alkermes a royalty in the mid-single digit percentages in the aggregate. For licensed products sold by a collaboration partner, Civitas will pay Alkermes the lower of either (1) a royalty in the mid-single digit percentage of net sales of licensed products in any given year, or (2) a percentage in the low-to-mid-double digits of all collaboration partner revenue received. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the royalty paid be less than a low-single digit percentage of net sales of a licensed product in any given calendar year. Civitas must pay these royalties on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of: (1) the expiration of all patents acquired pursuant to the Alkermes agreement containing valid claims covering such licensed products in such country, or (2) a certain number of years after the launch of such licensed product in each specific country.
 The Alkermes agreement remains in effect until expiration of Civitas’s royalty obligations to Alkermes. Royalties are payable to Alkermes on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of (i) the expiration of the patents acquired from Alkermes containing a valid claim covering a product in a particular country and (ii) 12 years and six months after the launch of a product in a country. Either party may terminate the agreement for default of the other party. Civitas may terminate the Alkermes agreement for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice to Alkermes.
 Other License Agreements
 In addition to the material license and collaboration agreements described above, we have entered into numerous other license agreements to support our research and development programs. These other license agreements include the following:

• | We have an exclusive, worldwide license from the Canadian Spinal Research Organization for specified patents and know-how relating to the use of dalfampridine in the reduction of chronic pain and spasticity in a spinal cord injured subject.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have an exclusive, worldwide license from the Mayo Foundation for Education and Research, or Mayo Clinic, to specified patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property on certain antibodies relating to our research on the therapeutic use of these antibodies, specifically myelination and remyelination in MS and spinal cord injury.

• | We have an exclusive, worldwide sublicense from Paion AG (formerly CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc) to certain patents, patent applications and know-how relating to cimaglermin alfa or fragments thereof and non-protein products developed through the use of material covered by a valid claim in the patents. The license to these patents and the right to sublicense these patents were granted to Paion by the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research. We also have an exclusive, worldwide sublicense from Paion to certain Paion patents, patent applications, and know-how relating to the neuregulin growth factor gene NRG-2.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have a license from Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Inc., or Brigham, acting on its own behalf and on behalf of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, or Beth Israel, to patent rights relating to the use of cimaglermin in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Our rights in the U.S. are co-exclusive, with Brigham and Beth Israel having retained rights for internal research, clinical, and education purposes, and our rights outside the U.S. are exclusive.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our Biotie subsidiary has an exclusive, worldwide license from Roche Palo Alto LLC, Hoffman-La Roche Inc. and F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. to certain patents and know-how relating to tozadenant and certain patents and know-how relating to SYN120.

Manufacturing and Supply
 Ampyra
 We are party to a September 2003 agreement with Elan (now Alkermes, following Alkermes’s 2011 acquisition of Elan’s Drug Technologies business) for our clinical and commercial supply of Ampyra. Under that agreement, we are required to purchase at least 75% of our annual commercial requirements of Ampyra from Alkermes unless Alkermes is unable or unwilling to meet our requirements. In addition, the agreement also obligates us to make compensatory payments if we do not purchase 100% of our requirements from Alkermes.
 As permitted by our agreement with Alkermes, we have designated Patheon, Inc. as a second manufacturing source of Ampyra. In connection with that designation, we entered into a manufacturing agreement with Patheon, and Alkermes assisted us in transferring manufacturing technology to Patheon. We and Alkermes have agreed that we may purchase up to 25% of our annual requirements from Patheon if we make compensatory payments to Alkermes. In addition, Patheon may supply us with Ampyra if Alkermes is unable or unwilling to meet our requirements.
 Under a Consent Agreement among Elan (now Alkermes, following Alkermes’s acquisition of Elan’s Drug Technologies business), Biogen and us, Alkermes consented to our sublicense of our rights under our agreements with Alkermes to Biogen. The three parties agreed to set up a committee to coordinate activities under these agreements with respect to the development, supply and commercialization of the licensed products for Biogen's territory. The Consent Agreement also amended our agreements with Alkermes by, among other things, permitting us to allow Biogen to grant sublicenses to certain unaffiliated distributors, permitting us to allow Biogen to package the licensed products and to work directly with Alkermes with respect to certain supply-related activities, and requiring Alkermes to facilitate the qualification of an alternate supplier of the licensed products under certain circumstances.
 We rely on two third-party manufacturers, Regis Technologies, Inc. and CU Chemie Uetikon (GmbH), to supply 4-aminopyridine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Ampyra. If these companies experience any disruption in their operations, a delay or interruption in the supply of our Ampyra product could result until the problem is solved or we locate an alternate source of supply. We may not be able to enter into alternative supply arrangements on terms that are commercially favorable, if at all. Any new supplier would also be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements. We could experience substantial delays before we are able to qualify any new supplier.
 Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder), CVT-427 and ARCUS Technology
 Our 2014 acquisition of Civitas included its 90,000 square foot subleased manufacturing facility located in Chelsea, Massachusetts. The facility was built specifically for the commercial-scale manufacture of ARCUS products. Prior to Civitas’s acquisition of this facility from Alkermes, the facility produced more than 36 million human doses of ARCUS-based products for use in clinical trials by Alkermes’s collaborator in indications other than Parkinson’s disease. Civitas subsequently took steps to recommission the facility, which has been certified by the EU regulatory authority (known as the Qualified Person, or QP, audit). Civitas produced current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP-quality human doses of Inbrija for Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials.
 We have developed mature quality systems to support commercial production. As described above, we have manufactured drug product at research and development scale and we believe that we have the expertise to transfer to large, commercial scale while maintaining all relevant drug product attributes. Consequently, we believe that we will be able to ensure reliable production that meets the requirements of the FDA and other regulatory agencies.
 As we are already at commercial scale, we believe that our Chelsea manufacturing facility will support rapid commercialization should we receive marketing approval from the FDA. However, if we obtain approval from the FDA, we anticipate the need to expand our manufacturing capacity at the Chelsea facility after product launch to meet demand depending on the timing and extent of sales growth. The ARCUS dry powder aerosol particles are generated by applying our proprietary and multi-step spray drying process to active pharmaceutical ingredient. The application of spray drying in the pharmaceutical industry is highly specialized, and the process of manufacturing ARCUS particles requires significant expertise in dry powder manufacture and handling and capsule filling. Expanding our manufacturing capacity will require substantial additional expenditures and various regulatory approvals and permits. Further, we may need to hire and train additional employees and managerial personnel to staff our expanding manufacturing operations. Manufacturing scale-up entails significant risks related to process development and manufacturing yields. In addition, we may face difficulties or 
 20


delays in developing or acquiring the necessary production equipment and technology. Our expanded Chelsea facility will have to continue to comply with cGMP requirements as well as other applicable environmental, safety, and other governmental permitting requirements.
 All Inbrija dry powder inventory has been manufactured in-house using our cGMP process. Current data supports Inbrija as a room temperature stable product. We have finalized drug formulation and fill weight and have also implemented final design changes for the inhaler, for which commercial molds have been produced. All raw materials used for Inbrija manufacture are standard in pharmaceutical production. Our manufacturing team is led by individuals who are highly experienced with manufacturing of ARCUS products and other commercial products. Many of the individuals who lead our manufacturing previously manufactured ARCUS products at this facility for Alkermes.
 Our proprietary inhalers are manufactured by contract manufacturers using standard manufacturing processes. We own the molds and design history files for the inhalers. The inhalers are shipped fully assembled to us. Final design changes for the inhaler for our anticipated commercial launch have been implemented, and the molds have been produced.
 rHIgM22
 We contracted with BioVest International, now Cell Culture Company, and CMC Biologics in 2009 for production and purification, respectively, of rHIgM22. All manufacturing was performed under cGMPs. Acorda and CMC Biologics developed analytical methods and characterization assays to support manufacturing and stability testing of the drug substance. A pilot lot of drug substance was tested in GLP studies for safety and toxicology.
 The final drug product for rHIgM22 for clinical studies was produced at Althea Technologies, now Ajinomoto Althea, Inc., using material produced by CMC Biologics as described above. The manufacturing process for drug substance and drug product, along with initial stability data for both, was submitted to FDA as part of an IND application originally filed in August 2012.
 Intellectual Property  
 We have patent portfolios relating to: Ampyra/aminopyridines; Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder), CVT-427 and the ARCUS drug delivery technology; SYN120, BTT1023; cimaglermin alfa/neuregulins; remyelinating antibodies/antibodies relating to nervous system disorders; Qutenza and NP-1998/topical capsaicin formulations. These portfolios are comprised of both our own and in-licensed patents and patent applications. Our intellectual property also includes copyrights, confidential and trade secret information as well as a portfolio of trademarks.
 The intellectual property relating to our programs is owned or licensed either directly by Acorda or indirectly through subsidiaries, including for example subsidiaries we acquired in connection with our 2014 acquisition of Civitas Therapeutics, Inc. and our 2016 acquisition of Biotie Therapies Corp. Throughout this report, we may refer to any and all such intellectual property, and the corresponding research and development programs as, “our” or “Acorda’s” programs.
 Ampyra/aminopyridines
 We have five issued patents listed in the Orange Book for Ampyra, four of which were held invalid in litigation in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware with certain generic drug manufacturers, as further described in this report. The first is U.S. Patent No. 5,540,938, the claims of which relate to methods for treating a neurological disease, such as MS, and cover the use of a sustained release dalfampridine formulation, such as Ampyra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg for improving walking in people with MS. In April 2013, this patent received a five year patent term extension under the patent restoration provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. With a five year patent term extension, this patent will expire on July 30, 2018. We have an exclusive license to this patent from Alkermes (originally with Elan, but transferred to Alkermes as part of its acquisition of Elan’s Drug Technologies business). This patent was held valid by the District Court in the litigation, although in June 2017 the defendant generic drug manufacturers with whom we have not reached settlements appealed the District Court’s decision upholding this patent.
 The other four Orange Book-listed patents were held invalid by the District Court in the litigation with generic drug manufacturers. These patents, which had been set to expire in 2025 through 2027, consist of U.S. Patent No. 8,007,826, with claims relating to methods to improve walking in patients with MS by administering 10 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily; U.S. Patent No. 8,354,437, which includes claims relating to methods to improve 
 21


walking, increase walking speed, and treat walking disability in patients with MS by administering 10 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily; U.S. Patent No. 8,440,703, which includes claims directed to methods of improving lower extremity function and walking and increasing walking speed in patients with MS by administering less than 15 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily; and U.S. Patent No. 8,663,685 with claims relating to methods to improve walking in patients with MS by administering 10 mg of sustained release 4-aminopyridine (dalfampridine) twice daily.
 The patent litigation referenced above relates to Paragraph IV Certification Notices received from ten generic drug manufacturers in 2014 and 2015, who submitted Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the FDA seeking marketing approval for generic versions of Ampyra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10mg. The ANDA filers challenged the validity of our Orange Book-listed patents for Ampyra, and they also asserted that generic versions of their products do not infringe certain claims of these patents. In 2015 and 2016, we reached settlement agreements with six of the generic companies. A bench trial against the remaining four generic companies was completed in September 2016. In February 2017, we announced that we had reached a settlement agreement with one of those four generic companies. In March 2017, the District Court rendered a decision upholding our Orange-Book listed patent for Ampyra set to expire in July 2018, but invalidating our four other Orange Book-listed patents. In May 2017, we appealed the ruling on these four patents, and as described above, in June 2017 the other non-settling parties appealed the decision on the patent set to expire in July 2018. We expect the appeals process to take approximately 12 to 18 months from the filing of the appeal in May 2017. Both the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) filed amicus briefs in support of our appeal, raising important issues in conjunction with biopharmaceutical innovation.
 In 2011, the European Patent Office, or EPO, granted EP 1732548, with claims relating to, among other things, use of a sustained release aminopyridine composition, such as dalfampridine (known under the trade name Fampyra in the European Union), to increase walking speed. In March 2012, Synthon B.V. and neuraxpharm Arzneimittel GmBH filed oppositions with the EPO challenging the EP 1732548 patent. We defended the patent, and in December 2013, we announced that the EPO Opposition Division upheld amended claims in this patent covering a sustained release formulation of dalfampridine for increasing walking in patients with MS through twice daily dosing at 10 mg. Both Synthon B.V. and neuraxpharm Arzneimittel GmBH have appealed the decision. In December 2013, Synthon B.V., neuraxpharm Arzneimittel GmBH and Actavis Group PTC EHF filed oppositions with the EPO challenging our EP 2377536 patent, which is a divisional of the EP 1732548 patent. On February 24, 2016, the EPO Opposition Division rendered a decision that revoked the EP 2377536 patent. We believe the claims of this patent are valid and we have appealed the decision. Both European patents, if upheld as valid, are set to expire in 2025, absent any additional exclusivity granted based on regulatory review timelines. Fampyra also has 10 years of market exclusivity in the European Union that is set to expire in 2021.
 We will vigorously defend our intellectual property rights.
 Legal proceedings relating to our Ampyra patents are described in further detail in Part II, Item 1 of this report.
 Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder), CVT-427 and ARCUS Technology
 The intellectual property portfolio that we acquired with Civitas has over 100 issued U.S. and foreign patents relating to Inbrija and the ARCUS drug delivery technology. This includes over 15 issued U.S. patents relating to Inbrija directed to compositions of the drug product, the inhaler, the capsule for the drug product, methods of delivery of L-dopa, and manufacturing processes. The latest of the issued patents expires in 2032. The CVT-427 program, which also utilizes the ARCUS drug delivery technology, has pending applications directed to formulations, which, if granted would expire in 2036 absent any patent term adjustment. These applications are for our current CVT-427 formulation, and we plan to work on reformulating CVT-427 to move the program forward.
 SYN120 
 We
 have an exclusive license from Roche for patents and patent applications relating to SYN120. This includes four granted U.S. patents set to expire in 2025 and 2026. The license also includes foreign counterparts, including two granted European patents, set to expire in 2025. The claims are directed to compositions of matter and methods of use.
 BTT1023
 The BTT1023 portfolio includes two patent families. The first family is owned by Biotie and includes two granted U.S. patents set to expire in 2028 and foreign counterparts including a granted European patent set to expire in 2028. The claims 
 22


are directed to composition of matter and methods of use. The second family is co-owned by Biotie with the University of Birmingham and includes a granted U.S. and European patent set to expire in 2030. This family also includes pending and granted counterparts in other countries. The claims of this family are directed to use of VAP-1 inhibitors for treatment of fibrotic conditions. The University of Birmingham has licensed their rights in this patent family back to Biotie.
 Remyelinating Antibodies/Antibodies Related to Nervous System Disorders
 Acorda is the exclusive licensee of a portfolio of patents and patent applications related to a series of remyelinating antibodies and their use discovered by scientists at the Mayo Clinic. This portfolio also includes granted and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications directed to additional antibodies and their use. With regard to remyelinating antibodies, the portfolio includes granted European patents as well as other granted foreign counterparts.
 Cimaglermin alfa/Neuregulins 
 We are the exclusive licensee under a license agreement with Paion AG (formerly CeNeS Pharmaceuticals, plc), of its worldwide portfolio of patents, patent applications and IP rights related to products of neuregulin genes, including cimaglermin alfa. Collectively, these patents claim the use of particular neuregulins to treat various pathophysiological conditions, particularly uses to stimulate myelinating cells in order to treat conditions of the central and peripheral nervous system that involve demyelination. These patents also claim a number of additional potential uses of neuregulins, including stimulation of growth in cardiac and mammalian muscle cells, as well as treating cardiac failure, peripheral neuropathy and nerve injury.
 Our neuregulin portfolio includes a granted U.S. patent directed to using specified neuregulin sequences to treat congestive heart failure.
 Qutenza and NP-1998/Topical Capsaicin Formulations 
 We have commercialization and development rights for Qutenza and NP-1998 in the U.S., Canada, Latin America and certain other territories. In the U.S., we have one Orange Book-listed patent for Qutenza, which is U.S. Patent No. 6,239,180. The original expiration date for Patent No. 6,239,180 was November 6, 2016. In October 2017, this patent received 1,671 days of patent term extension under the patent restoration provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act. With that patent term extension, this patent will expire on June 4, 2021. 
 There are granted U.S. patents which include claims directed to NP-1998 providing coverage until September 2027. There are also cases granted in Canada and Japan set to expire in 2024. There is also a pending U.S. patent application and a pending Japanese patent application which, if granted, would expire in 2024.
 Trademarks
 In addition to patents, our intellectual property portfolio includes registered trademarks, along with pending trademark applications. We own several registered trademarks in the U.S. and in other countries. These registered trademarks include, in the U.S., the marks “Acorda Therapeutics,” our stylized Acorda Therapeutics logo, “Biotie Therapies,” “Ampyra,” “Qutenza” and “ARCUS.” We also have trademark registrations for “Fampyra” and “Kampyra” and pending trademark applications therefore, in numerous foreign jurisdictions. In addition, our trademark portfolio includes several trademark registrations and pending trademark applications for potential product names and for disease awareness activities.
Competition
 The market for developing and marketing pharmaceutical products is highly competitive. We are aware of many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that are engaged in development and/or marketing of therapeutics for a broad range of central nervous system conditions, including multiple sclerosis, or MS and Parkinson’s disease. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, research and development, human and other resources than we do. Furthermore, many of these companies have significantly more experience than we do in preclinical testing, human clinical trials, regulatory approval procedures and sales and marketing.

Ampyra/MS
 Current disease management approaches to MS are classified either as relapse management, disease course management, or symptom management approaches. For relapse management, the majority of neurologists treat sudden and severe relapses with a four-day course of intravenous high-dose corticosteroids. Many of these corticosteroids are available generically. For disease course management, there are a number of FDA-approved MS therapies that seek to modify the immune system. These treatments attempt to reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations or slow the accumulation of physical disability for people with certain types of MS, though their precise mechanisms of action are not known. These products include Avonex, Tysabri, Plegridy and Tecfidera from Biogen, Betaseron from Bayer AG, Copaxone from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., Rebif from Merck Serono, Gilenya and Extavia from Novartis AG, Aubagio and Lemtrada from Genzyme Corporation (a Sanofi company), Glatopa from Sandoz International GmbH (a Novartis AG company), Zinbryta from Biogen and AbbieVie, and Rituxan from F. Hoffman-La Roche AG.
 To our knowledge, Ampyra is the first and only product that is approved as a treatment to improve walking in adult patients with MS. This was demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. Several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic laboratories, are involved in research and/or product development for various neurological diseases, including MS. Other companies also have products in clinical development, including products approved for other indications in MS, to address improvement of walking ability in people with MS. We are aware that Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing ADS-5102 (amantadine hydrochloride) in patients with MS who have walking impairment, which may compete with Ampyra. Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing a 3,4-diaminopyridine product, licensed from Biomarin, that also may compete with Ampyra.
 Several companies are engaged in developing products that include novel immune system approaches and cell therapy approaches to remyelination for the treatment of people with MS. These programs are in early stages of development and may compete with Ampyra or our preclinical candidates in the future.
 In addition, in certain circumstances, pharmacists are not prohibited from formulating certain drug compounds to fill prescriptions on an individual patient basis, which is referred to as compounding. We are aware that at present compounded dalfampridine is used by some people with MS, and it is possible that some people will want to continue using compounded formulations even though Ampyra is commercially available.
 We believe that Ampyra is complementary to both the relapse management and disease course management therapies that are commercially available. Nonetheless, Ampyra may compete for market acceptance with these current treatments because they have been accepted and regularly prescribed to adults with MS by physicians, or because physicians may think that these products also improve walking or other neurological functions.
 Ampyra could become subject to competition from generic drug manufacturers. In March 2017, we announced a decision by the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in litigation with certain generic drug manufacturers upholding our Ampyra Orange Book-listed patent set to expire on July 30, 2018, but invalidating our four other Orange Book-listed patents pertaining to Ampyra that were set to expire between 2025 and 2027. Under this decision, we expect to maintain patent exclusivity with respect to Ampyra at least through July 30, 2018, depending on the outcome of appeal of the District Court’s decision. The defendant generic drug manufacturers have appealed the District Court’s decision upholding the patent that expires in July 2018, and we have appealed the ruling on the four invalidated patents. We expect the appeals process to take approximately 12 to 18 months from the filing of the appeal in May 2017. We expect to experience a rapid and significant decline in Ampyra sales beyond July 2018 due to competition from generic versions of Ampyra that may be marketed after the expiration of our remaining Ampyra patent, unless the District Court’s decision on the four invalidated patents is overturned on appeal, which could include reversal or remand by the appeals court back to the District Court. Our litigation with these generic drug manufacturers is described in further detail in Part I, Item 3 of this report. We will need to continue devoting significant resources to this litigation, and we can provide no assurance concerning its duration or outcome.
 Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder)/Parkinson’s disease
 If approved for the treatment of OFF periods (re-emergence of symptoms), Inbrija would compete against on-demand therapies that aim to specifically address Parkinson’s disease symptoms. Apokyn, an injectable formulation of apomorphine, is approved for the treatment of OFF periods. Apokyn was approved for this use in the U.S. in 2004 and in Europe in 1993. Also, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. is developing a sublingual, or under the tongue, formulation of apomorphine. This program is in Phase 3 clinical development and could potentially be commercially launched ahead of Inbrija. In January 
 24


2018, Sunovion announced positive topline results from their pivotal Phase 3 study, which will be used in support of their submission of a New Drug Application expected in spring 2018.
 The standard of care for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease is oral carbidopa/levodopa, but oral medication can be associated with wide variability in the timing and the amount of absorption and there are significant challenges in creating a regimen that consistently maintains therapeutic effects as Parkinson’s disease progresses. Inbrija may face competition from therapies that can limit the occurrence of OFF periods. Approaches to achieve consistent levodopa plasma concentrations include new formulations of carbidopa/levodopa, such as extended-release and intestinal infusions, and therapies that prolong the effect of levodopa. Impax Laboratories has received FDA approval for RYTARY, an extended-release formulation of oral carbidopa/levodopa, and extended release formulations of oral and patch carbidopa/levodopa are being developed by others including Impax Depomed Inc., Intec Pharma and NeuroDerm Ltd. Also, Abbvie Inc. has developed a continuous administration of a gel-containing levodopa through a tube that is surgically implanted into the intestine. This therapy, known as Duopa, has been approved by the FDA and is approved in the EU.
 Qutenza/Post-Herpetic Neuralgia
 Qutenza faces significant competition from various other oral and topical products that are indicated to treat post-herpetic neuralgia and/or other forms of neuropathic pain, as well as other prescription and over the counter pain medications not specifically indicated for neuropathic pain that patients may use to address their symptoms. Many of the prescription pain medications that may compete with Qutenza are available in generic forms. Although we have no current plans to develop and commercialize NP-1998, this product would similarly face significant competition from these other products if we were to do so.
 Also, unlike our other products, Qutenza may be administered only by a health care professional in an office, clinic, or hospital setting. For this reason, it is treated as a “buy-and-bill” product by most payers, including most Medicare programs, Medicaid programs, and private payers. Buy-and-bill products must be purchased by health care providers before they can be administered to patients. Health care providers subsequently must seek reimbursement for the product from the applicable third party payer such as Medicaid or a health insurance company. Health care providers may be reluctant to administer Qutenza because they would have to fund the purchase of the product and then seek reimbursement (which may differ somewhat from their purchase price), or because they do not want the additional administrative burden required for the product.
 Government Regulation
 FDA Regulation of Drugs and Drug Product Approval
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the preclinical testing, clinical development, manufacture, distribution and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, sale, promotion, import and export of our products and product candidates.
 In the U.S., Ampyra, Qutenza, and our product candidates are regulated by the FDA as drugs. Some of our product candidates are potentially regulated both as drugs, drug/medical device combinations and as biological products. Drugs, biologics, and medical devices primarily are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and the regulations of the FDA. These products are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage may result in various adverse consequences, including the FDA's and other health authorities' delay in approving or refusal to approve a product. Violations of regulatory requirements also may result in enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, labeling restrictions, seizure of products, fines, injunctions and/or civil or criminal penalties. Similar civil or criminal penalties could be imposed by other government agencies or agencies of the states and localities in which our products are tested, manufactured, sold or distributed.
 25


The process required by the FDA under these laws before our drug and biological product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
  
• | preclinical laboratory and animal tests;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug, or the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biologic, for each intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review of whether each facility in which the product is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product's identity, strength, quality, and purity; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission and FDA approval of a New Drug Application, or NDA, in the case of a drug, or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, in the case of a biologic, containing preclinical and clinical data, proposed labeling, information to demonstrate that the product will be manufactured to appropriate standards, and other required information.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The research, development and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approval will be granted on a timely or commercially viable basis, if at all.
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate, its chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies to assess its safety and potential efficacy. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. The IND sponsor may initiate clinical trials 30 days after filing the IND application, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Further, an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, charged with protecting the welfare of human subjects involved in research at each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trials must review and approve any clinical trial before it commences at that center. The IRB(s) must continue to monitor the trial until its completion. Many studies also employ a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, with experts who are otherwise independent of the conduct of the study and are given access to the unblinded study data periodically during the study to determine whether the study should be halted. For example, a DSMB might halt a study if an unacceptable safety issue emerges, or if the data showing the effectiveness of the study drug would make it unethical to continue giving patients placebo. Study subjects must provide informed consent before their participation in the research study.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap:
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially administered into healthy human subjects or subjects with the target condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dosage range of the drug is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to confirm the clinical efficacy from Phase 2 and to further test for safety in an expanded population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the case of product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases such as MS, the initial human testing is often conducted in affected patients rather than in healthy volunteers. Since these patients already have the target condition, these clinical trials may provide initial evidence of efficacy traditionally obtained in Phase 2 clinical trials and thus these clinical trials are frequently referred to as Phase 1b clinical trials.
 Before proceeding with a Phase 3 trial, sponsors may seek a written agreement from the FDA regarding the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim. This is known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. SPAs help establish up front agreement with the FDA about the adequacy of the design of a clinical trial, but the agreement does not guarantee FDA approval even if the SPA is followed. For example a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug could be identified after the testing has begun. In addition, even if an SPA remains in place and the trial meets its endpoints with statistical significance, the FDA could determine that the overall balance of risks and benefits for the product candidate is not adequate to support approval, or only 
 26


justifies approval for a narrow set of clinical uses, or approval with restricted distribution or other burdensome post-approval requirements or limitations.
 Federal and state law requires the submission of registry and results information for most clinical trials to a publicly available database at www.clinicaltrials.gov. These requirements generally do not apply to Phase 1 clinical trials.
 U.S. law requires that trials conducted to support approval for product marketing be "adequate and well controlled." This entails a number of requirements, including that there is a clear statement of objects and methods in the protocol, the study design permits a valid comparison with a control (e.g., a placebo, another drug already approved for the studied condition, or a non-concurrent control such as historical data), and that the statistical methods used to analyze the data are adequate to assess the effects of the drug. Studies must also be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements.
 We cannot be certain that we will successfully complete Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing of our product candidates within any specific time period, if at all. Furthermore, the FDA, the IRBs or the DSMB may prevent clinical trials from beginning or may place clinical trials on hold or terminate them at any point in this process if, among other reasons, they conclude that study subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 In the U.S., for most drugs and biologics, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA for review and approval prior to marketing and commercial distribution of the product candidate. If the product candidate is regulated as a drug, an NDA must be submitted and approved before commercial marketing may begin. If the product candidate, such as an antibody, is regulated as a biologic, a BLA must be submitted and approved before commercial marketing may begin. The NDA or BLA must include a substantial amount of data and other information concerning safety and effectiveness (for a drug) and safety, purity and potency (for a biologic) of the compound from laboratory, animal and clinical testing, as well as data and information on manufacturing, product stability, and proposed product labeling.
 Each domestic and foreign manufacturing establishment, including any contract manufacturers we may decide to use, must be listed in the NDA or BLA and must be registered with the FDA. The application will not be approved until the FDA conducts a manufacturing inspection, approves the applicable manufacturing process for the drug or biological product, and determines that the facility is in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements. If the manufacturing facilities and processes fail to pass the FDA inspection, we will not receive approval to market these products, or approval may be delayed until the manufacturing issues are resolved. The FDA may also inspect clinical trial sites and/or the clinical sponsor for compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP. If the FDA determines that one or more of our clinical trials were not conducted in accordance with GCP, the agency may determine not to consider effectiveness data generated from such clinical trials in support of our applications for marketing approval.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, the FDA receives fees for reviewing a BLA or NDA and supplements thereto, as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products. These fees could be significant.
 Once an NDA or BLA is submitted for FDA approval, the FDA will accept the NDA or BLA for filing if deemed complete, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established performance goals for the review of NDAs and BLAs: six months for priority applications and 10 months for regular applications, with two additional months added to each period for new molecular entities. However, the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods and these performance goals may change over time. Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if favorable, often is not an actual approval but an “action letter” or “complete response letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved. This additional work could include substantial additional clinical trials. The FDA's review of an application may involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee.
 The FDA may deny an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional preclinical or clinical data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If the FDA approves a product, it will limit the approved therapeutic uses for the product as described in the product labeling, may require that contraindications or warning statements be included in the product labeling, may require that additional post-approval studies or clinical trials be conducted as a condition of the approval, may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, or may otherwise limit the scope of any approval. Under a REMS, the FDA may impose 
 27


significant restrictions on distribution and use of a marketed product, may require the distribution of medication guides to patients and/or healthcare professionals or patient communication plans, and may impose a timetable for submission of assessments of the effectiveness of a REMS. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
 Satisfaction of the above FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years or more and the actual time required may vary substantially, based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time or permanently and impose costly procedures upon our activities. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product, labeling changes or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Delays in obtaining, or failures to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals would harm our business. Marketing our product candidates abroad will require similar regulatory approvals and is subject to similar risks. In addition, we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future U.S. or foreign governmental action.
 Post-Approval Regulation
 Any products manufactured or distributed in the U.S. by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements relating to record-keeping, labeling, packaging, reporting of adverse experiences and other reporting, advertising and promotion, distribution, cGMPs, and import/export, as well as any other requirements imposed by the applicant’s NDA or BLA. The FDA's rules for advertising and promotion require, among other things, that our promotion be truthful, fairly balanced and adequately substantiated, and that our labeling bears adequate directions for all intended uses of the product. We must also submit appropriate new and supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. On its own initiative, the FDA may require changes to the labeling of an approved drug, require post-approval studies or clinical trials, or impose a REMS post-approval if it becomes aware of new safety information that the agency believes impacts the drug’s safety profile. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Foreign drug manufacturers must comply with similar local requirements and may be subject to inspections by the FDA or local regulatory agencies. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with cGMPs and other regulatory requirements. The FDA also enforces the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which, among other things, imposes various requirements in connection with the distribution of product samples to physicians.
 In addition to inspections related to manufacturing, we are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies related to the other regulatory requirements that apply to marketed drugs manufactured or distributed by us. The FDA also may conduct periodic inspections regarding our review and reporting of adverse events, or related to compliance with the requirements of the PDMA concerning the handling of drug samples. When the FDA conducts an inspection, the inspectors will identify any deficiencies they believe exist in the form of a notice of inspectional observations on FDA Form 483. The observations may be more or less significant. If we receive a notice of inspectional observations, we likely will be required to respond in writing, and may be required to undertake corrective and preventive actions in order to address the FDA's concerns. Failure to address the FDA’s concerns may result in the issuance of a warning letter or other enforcement or administrative actions.
 We and our product candidates are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where they are or will be marketed, or where we may have operations. For example, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in that state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Federal law and some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including requirements for the development of systems capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Any applicable federal, state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market, or increase the cost of marketing, our products in those states or localities.
 The FDA's policies may change and additional U.S. or foreign government laws and/or regulations may be enacted which could impose additional burdens or limitations on our ability to obtain approval of our product candidates or market our products after approval. Moreover, increased attention to the containment of healthcare costs in the U.S. and in foreign 
 28


markets could result in government scrutiny or new regulations that could harm our business. For example, significant price increases in recent years by certain drug manufacturers have received considerable scrutiny from U.S. Congress, in some cases forcing those companies to dramatically reduce those prices. There continues to be political pressure at both the U.S. federal and state levels related to drug pricing and drug transparency, particularly given the dynamics around upcoming elections, that could result in legislative or administrative actions, such as the State of California’s passage of SB 17 in 2017, or at a minimum continued scrutiny. California SB 17, for example, put in place new state reporting and notification requirements for manufacturers related to drug pricing, which became effective January 1, 2018. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
 Orphan Drugs
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, special incentives exist for sponsors to develop products for rare diseases or conditions, which are defined to include those diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. Requests for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the submission of an NDA, BLA, or supplemental NDA or BLA for the orphan use. We received an orphan drug designation for Ampyra for the treatment of both MS and incomplete spinal cord injury. The number of people affected by MS now exceeds 200,000. However, this does not affect Ampyra’s orphan drug designation in the United States, as it was granted prior to the increase in prevalence above 200,000.
 Products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for special grant funding for research and development, FDA assistance with the review of clinical trial protocols, potential tax credits for research, and reduced filing fees for marketing applications. If a product that has an orphan drug designation is the first such product to receive FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity for that use. This means that, subsequent to approval, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, for seven years. The FDA may approve a subsequent application from another sponsor if the FDA determines that the application is for a different drug or different use, or if the FDA determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior or demonstrates a major contribution to patient care, or that the holder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public's need. If the FDA approves another sponsor’s application for a drug that is the same as a drug with orphan exclusivity, but for a different use, the competing drug could be prescribed by physicians outside its approved use, including for the orphan use, notwithstanding the existence of orphan exclusivity. A grant of an orphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved. If a sponsor receives orphan drug exclusivity upon approval, there can be no assurance that the exclusivity will prevent another person from receiving approval for the same or a similar drug for the same or other uses.
 Some other jurisdictions have orphan drug rules and offer similar incentives. In the EU, for example, a designated orphan drug benefits from free scientific advice and reduced application fees. Moreover, an approved orphan drug benefits from a 10-year exclusivity period, during which regulators can neither accept nor approve applications for similar medicinal products for the same indication, unless there are insufficient supplies of the approved orphan drug or the similar product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior than the approved orphan drug. Under the EU system, however, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, will reassess orphan status in parallel with the European Medicines Agency’s assessment of the marketing authorization application and the COMP can recommend that orphan status is removed if the product no longer meets the relevant criteria.
 Generic Drugs, AB Ratings and Pharmacy Substitution
 Generic drugs are approved through an abbreviated regulatory process, which differs in important ways from the process followed for innovative products. For generic versions of drugs subject to an NDA, an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, is filed with the FDA. The ANDA must seek approval of a product candidate that has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use (labeling) as a so-called "reference listed drug" that has already been approved pursuant to a full NDA. Only limited exceptions exist to this ANDA sameness requirement, including certain limited variations approved by the FDA through a special suitability petition process. ANDA applicants are not required to submit clinical data to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Instead, FDA relies on its findings of safety and effectiveness of the reference listed drug to approve the ANDA. As a result, the law requires the ANDA applicant submit only limited clinical data to demonstrate that the product covered by the ANDA is absorbed in the body at a rate and extent consistent with that of the reference listed drug. This is known as bioequivalence. In addition, the ANDA must contain information regarding the manufacturing processes and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality. It also must contain certifications with respect to all patents that are listed for the reference listed drug in the FDA’s publication, “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” commonly known as the “Orange Book.”
 29


Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, drugs that are new chemicals entities, or NCEs, are eligible for a five-year data exclusivity period. During this period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA submitted by another company that relies on any of the data submitted by the innovator company. This exclusivity period also applies to “505(b)(2)” applications, which are hybrid applications that rely in-part on pioneer data and in-part on new clinical data submitted to account for differences between the 505(b)(2) product and the reference listed drug. ANDA applicants and 505(b)(2) applicants must certify to all patents listed in the Orange Book for the reference listed drug (i.e., the innovator NDA). An ANDA (or 505(b)(2) application) may be submitted to FDA after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of those listed patents. The statute also provides three years of data exclusivity for an NDA (or NDA supplement) that is not an NCE if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed essential to approval. During this period, the FDA will not approve an application filed by a third party for the protected conditions of use that relies on any of the data that was submitted by the innovator company. Neither exclusivity period blocks the approval of full applications (i.e., full NDAs) submitted to the FDA because full NDAs do not rely on a pioneer’s data.
 Special procedures apply when an ANDA contains one or more certifications stating that a listed patent is invalid or not infringed. This is known as a “Paragraph IV” certification. If the owner of the patent or the NDA for the reference listed drug brings a patent infringement suit within a specified time after receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification, an automatic stay bars FDA approval of the ANDA for 30 months, which period may be extended under certain circumstances. The length of the automatic stay depends on whether the FDA classifies the reference listed drug as an NCE, as follows:
  
• | If the FDA does not classify the reference listed drug as an NCE, then the automatic stay is for 30 months from the date that the manufacturer of the reference listed drug receives the patent certification described above.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | If the reference listed drug is classified by the FDA as an NCE, then the length of the automatic stay depends on when the ANDA is filed. No company can file an ANDA on a reference listed drug that the FDA has designated as an NCE until five years after the reference listed drug’s FDA approval, except that an ANDA may be submitted four years after the reference listed drug’s FDA approval if the ANDA contains a Paragraph IV patent certification. If an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification is filed five or more years after FDA approval of the NCE, then the stay duration is 30 months. However, if an ANDA (with a Paragraph IV certification) is filed in between the fourth and fifth years after FDA approval of the NCE, the automatic 30 month stay is extended by a number of months equal to the number of months remaining in the fifth year after approval of the reference listed drug, providing a total of up to a 42 month stay.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If the stay is either lifted or expires and the FDA approves the ANDA, the generic manufacturer may decide to begin selling its product even if patent litigation is pending. However, if the generic manufacturer launches before patent litigation is resolved, the launch is at the risk of the generic manufacturer being later held liable for patent infringement damages.
 Many states require or permit pharmacists to substitute generic equivalents for brand-name prescriptions unless the physician has prohibited substitution. Managed care organizations often urge physicians to prescribe drugs with generic equivalents, and to authorize substitution, as a means of controlling costs of prescriptions. They also may require lower copayments as an incentive to patients to ask for and accept generics. 
 While the question of substitutability is one of state law, most states look to the FDA to determine whether a generic is substitutable. The FDA lists therapeutic equivalence ratings in the “Orange Book.”  In general, a generic drug that is listed in the Orange Book as therapeutically equivalent to the branded product will be substitutable under state law and, conversely, a generic drug that is not so listed will not be substitutable. Drug products that the FDA considers to be therapeutically equivalent to other drug products receive one of various types of “A” ratings. For example, solid oral dosage form drug products that are considered therapeutically equivalent are generally rated “AB” in the Orange Book, while therapeutically equivalent solutions and powders for aerosolization generally receive an “AB” or an “AN” rating depending on how bioequivalence was demonstrated.
 To be considered therapeutically equivalent, a generic drug must first be a pharmaceutical equivalent of the branded drug. This means that the generic has the same active ingredient, dosage form, strength or concentration and route of administration as the branded drug. Tablets and capsules are currently considered different dosage forms that are pharmaceutical alternatives and therefore are not substitutable pharmaceutical equivalents. In addition to being pharmaceutical equivalents, therapeutic equivalents must be bioequivalent to their branded counterparts. Bioequivalence for this purpose is defined in the same manner as for ANDA approvals, and usually requires a showing of comparable rate and extent of absorption in a small human study.
 30


The process described above is not applicable to drugs where the pioneer product was approved pursuant to a BLA, rather than an NDA. A separate process exists for follow-on versions of such products and is discussed in the section entitled “Biosimilars,” below.
 Requirements Applicable to Medical Devices in the United States 
 The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, effectiveness, storage, record keeping, marketing, import, export, and distribution of medical devices. The level of regulation applied by the FDA generally depends on the class into which the medical device falls: Class I, II, or III. Class I medical devices present the lowest risk, and Class III medical devices present the highest risk. In general, the higher class of device, the greater the degree of regulatory control. All devices, for example, are subject to “General Controls,” which include:

• | Establishment registration by manufacturers, distributors, re-packagers, and re-labelers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Device listing with FDA;
--+-------------------------


• | Good manufacturing practices;
--+------------------------------


• | Labeling regulations; and
--+--------------------------


• | Reporting of adverse events.
--+-----------------------------

 Class II medical devices are subject to General Controls, but also Special Controls, including special labeling requirements, mandatory performance standards, additional post market surveillance, and specific FDA guidance. Most Class III medical devices are assessed individually through an extensive Premarket Review application, or PMA. As a result, although they are subject to General Controls, they generally are not subject to Special Controls. Instead, most Class III devices have additional requirements and conditions of use imposed on them through the individualized PMA review and approval process.
 Although we do not manufacture or market stand-alone medical devices, some of our product candidates rely on device components to deliver drug product to patients. In general, the FDA regulates such products as “combination products.” The FDA assigns combination products for review by the drug or device center based on a determination of the product’s “primary mode of action.”  If the FDA determines that the product achieves its therapeutic effect through drug component, it will be assigned to the Center for Drugs (CDER) or the Center for Biologics (CBER) for review and approval. By contrast, if the FDA determines that the device component is the primary mode of action, then the product will be reviewed and approved by the center for devices (CDRH). CDER will be the lead review division for Inbrija. We anticipate that to the extent that any of our other pipeline products are regulated as combination products, the FDA likely will find that the primary mode of action is through the drug component, and therefore the product will be reviewed by CDER. In that case, however, CDER/CBER will consult with CDRH on the drug component and we will still have to comply with certain requirements applicable to medical devices.
 Most Class I devices are exempt from the FDA premarket review or approval. With some exceptions, Class II devices may be marketed only if the FDA “clears” the medical device through the 510(k) process, which requires a company to show that the device is “substantially equivalent” to certain devices already on the market. Again with some exceptions, Class III devices are approved through a PMA, which generally requires an applicant to submit data from clinical trials that establish the safety and effectiveness of the device. Clinical data are sometimes required for a 510(k) application as well. Manufacturers conducting clinical trials with medical devices are subject to similar requirements as those conducting clinical trials with drugs or biologics. For example, a manufacturer must obtain an investigational device exemption, or IDE, to test a significant risk device in humans, must comply with GCPs, and must obtain IRB approval.
 The FDA has broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers with respect to medical devices, similar to those for drugs and biologics. For example, medical devices are subject to detailed manufacturing standards under the FDA’s quality systems regulations, or QSRs, and specific rules regarding labeling and promotion. Medical device manufacturers must also register their establishments and list their products with the FDA.
 States also impose regulatory requirements on medical device manufacturers and distributors, including registration and record-keeping requirements. Failure to comply with the applicable federal and state medical device requirements could result in, among other things, refusal to approve or clear pending applications, withdrawal of an approval or clearance, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or other civil or criminal penalties.

Biosimilars
 The Affordable Care Act amended the Public Health Service Act to authorize the FDA to approve “biosimilars” (follow-on versions of pioneer products approved pursuant to a BLA) via a separate, abbreviated pathway. Under this abbreviated pathway, the biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that its product is “highly similar” to the “reference product,” and that there are no “clinically meaningful differences” between the biosimilar and the reference product. Unlike ANDAs, biosimilars are not, in general, automatically substitutable for the reference product at the pharmacy. Instead, the FDA must make a separate finding of “interchangeability.” To date, the trend in state law has been to permit or require substitution only of those biosimilars that have also been deemed by the FDA to be interchangeable.
 The Affordable Care Act also established a period of 12 years of data exclusivity against biosimilars for reference products in order to preserve incentives for future innovation. Under this framework, data exclusivity protects the data in the BLA-holders’s regulatory application by prohibiting others, for a period of 12 years, from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the reference product’s data in its approved BLA. In contrast to the provisions for NDAs, the biologics data exclusivity provisions do not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products, or otherwise create an “automatic stay” of FDA approval of a biosimilar. If our product candidates are approved as biologics, they may face significant competition from biosimilars in the future.
 Foreign Regulation and Product Approval
 Outside the U.S., our ability or the ability of our collaborator Biogen to market a product candidate is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Foreign marketing authorizations can be applied for at a national level, although within the European Union, or EU, registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in the entire European Economic Area, or EEA (through the “centralized procedure,” which is mandatory for certain products, including biotechnology and advanced therapy medicinal products, orphan medicines and new active substances for the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), cancer, neurodegenerative disorder, diabetes, auto-immune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases), or in more than one individual EU member state (through the “mutual recognition procedure” or “decentralized procedure”). The foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks associated with FDA approval discussed above.
Other Regulations
 In the U.S., the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug and biological products, as well as medical devices, are potentially subject to regulation and oversight by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and state and local governments. For example, controlled substances that are scheduled by the DEA are subject to additional regulatory requirements including, among other things, special security and handling requirements, and potential restrictions on distribution, sales, marketing. For example, sales, marketing, scientific/educational grant programs and other Acorda interactions with healthcare professionals, must comply with the anti-kickback and fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act and the False Claims Act, and may be affected by the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, and/or the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992. For products to be covered by Medicaid, drug manufacturers must enter into a rebate agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services on behalf of the states and must regularly submit certain pricing information to CMS. Under the VHCA, we are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense, or DOD, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities in order to participate in other federal health care programs including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, under legislative changes made in 2009, discounted prices must also be offered for certain DOD purchases for its TRICARE retail pharmacy program via a rebate system. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
 Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. In addition, our 
 32


activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 Under the Sunshine Act provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to federal reporting requirements with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. Reports submitted under these requirements are placed on a public database. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS annually. Similarly, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to annually report to FDA samples of prescription drugs requested by and distributed to healthcare providers. The law does not state whether these sample disclosures will be made publicly available, and the FDA has not provided any additional guidance as to how the data will be used.
 Our research and development and manufacturing activities are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including, among other matters, those governing laboratory procedures and the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment, remediation and disposal of hazardous substances; the exposure of persons to hazardous substances; the release of pollutants into the air and bodies of water; and the general health, safety and welfare of employees and members of the public. Our research and development and manufacturing activities and the activities of our third-party manufacturers involve the use of hazardous substances, and the risk of injury, contamination or noncompliance with the applicable environmental, health and safety requirements cannot be eliminated. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future. Although compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations have tended to become increasingly stringent and, to the extent legal or regulatory changes occur in the future, they could result in, among other things, increased costs to us.
 Reimbursement and Pricing Controls
 In many of the markets where we or Biogen, our collaborator for Ampyra, would commercialize a product following regulatory approval, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls, by law, and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms.
 In the U.S., there has been an increased focus on drug pricing in recent years. Although there are currently no direct government price controls over private sector purchases in the U.S., federal legislation requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay prescribed rebates on certain drugs to certain public healthcare programs, such as Medicaid, in order for the drugs to be eligible for reimbursement under those programs. Various states have adopted further mechanisms under Medicaid and other programs that seek to control drug prices, including by disfavoring certain higher priced drugs and by seeking supplemental rebates from manufacturers. Managed care has also become a potent force in the market place that increases downward pressure on the prices of pharmaceutical products. Recent heightened scrutiny of the prices of several drug products have led to numerous other proposals, at both the federal and state level, to address perceived issues related to drug pricing and drug transparency. Several other states have adopted or are considering adopting laws that require pharmaceutical companies to provide notice prior to raising pricing and other information related to price increases.
 Under the reimbursement methodology set forth in the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, physicians are reimbursed for drugs they administer to Medicare beneficiaries based on a product's "average sales price," or ASP. This ASP-based reimbursement methodology has generally led to lower reimbursement levels. The MMA also established the Medicare Part D outpatient prescription drug benefit, which is provided primarily through private entities that attempt to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers. The ACA requires drug manufacturers to provide a 50% discount on prescriptions for branded products filled while the beneficiary is in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also known as the “donut hole.”
 The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 resulted in changes to the way average manufacturer price, or AMP, and best price are reported to the government and the formula for calculating required Medicaid rebates. The ACA increased the minimum basic Medicaid rebate for branded prescription drugs to 23.1% and requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay states rebates on prescription drugs dispensed to Medicaid managed care enrollees. In addition, the ACA increased the additional Medicaid rebate on “line extensions” (such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, revised the definition of AMP by changing the classes of purchasers included in the calculation, and expanded the entities eligible for discounted 340B pricing.
 33


The ACA imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. The fee (which is not deductible for federal income tax purposes) is based on the manufacturer’s market share of sales of branded drugs and biologics (excluding orphan drugs) to, or pursuant to coverage under, specified U.S. government programs. The ACA also contains a number of provisions, including provisions governing the way that healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, increased funding for comparative effectiveness research for use in the healthcare industry, and enhancements to fraud and abuse requirements and enforcement, that will affect existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs.
 The U.S. President and the majority party in both Houses of the U.S. Congress have indicated their desire to repeal the ACA. It is unclear whether, when and how that repeal will be effectuated and what the effect on the healthcare sector will be. Changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenues or increase our costs could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.
 Public and private healthcare payers control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Payers also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered. In particular, many public and private healthcare payers limit reimbursement and coverage to the uses of a drug that are either approved by the FDA and/or appear in a recognized drug compendium. Drug compendia are publications that summarize the available medical evidence for particular drug products and identify which uses of a drug are supported or not supported by the available evidence, whether or not such uses have been approved by the FDA.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, for example, there is extensive regulation of pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement through health systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. The approach taken varies from member state to member state. Some jurisdictions operate positive and/or negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits and may limit or restrict reimbursement based on the results of health economic assessments. Others control the price of pharmaceutical products through reference pricing approaches where the reimbursement price is determined by the price in other jurisdictions. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products, as exemplified by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, in the United Kingdom which evaluates the data supporting new medicines and passes reimbursement recommendations to the government. In addition, in some countries cross-border imports from low-priced markets (parallel imports) exert commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
