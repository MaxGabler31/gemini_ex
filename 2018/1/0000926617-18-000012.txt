 ITEM 1.          BUSINESS
 Company Overview
 Corporate Vision: To drive the advancement of women’s health by providing innovative methods to detect, monitor and manage the treatment of both benign and malignant gynecologic disease, with our primary focus being diseases of the female pelvic cavity.    We have expanded our corporate strategy with the goal of transforming the Company from a technology license company to a global diagnostic and bio-analytic solutions provider. Our plan is to broaden our commercial focus from ovarian cancer to differential diagnosis of women with a range of gynecological disorders. Our strategy is being deployed in three phases.  The three phases are a rebuild phase, which was completed in 2015, a transformation phase, which was virtually completed in 2017 with the exception of our continuing expansion of payer coverage, and a market expansion and growth phase, which we plan to continue in 2018 and 2019.  
 During the first phase, we expanded our leadership team by hiring several new senior leaders including a chief executive officer.  In addition, we expanded our commercial strategy, reestablished medical and advisory support, rebuilt our patient advocacy strategy and established a billing system and a payer strategy outside of our relationship with Quest Diagnostics.  During the second phase, we completed the process of obtaining licensure of ASPiRA LABS in all of the states that require licenses, are in the process of establishing our own payer coverage for OVA1, Multivariate Index Assay (MIA), and launched a second-generation OVA1 test, trademarked Overa, Multivariate Index Assay, 2nd Generation (MIA2G), on a targeted basis.  In the third phase, we plan to globally commercialize OVA1 and Overa by utilizing the full national licensure of ASPiRA LABS, select laboratories for distribution, managed care coverage in select markets, our sales force and existing customer base.  Unlike OVA1, Overa uses a global testing platform, which allows Overa to be deployed internationally.  We initiated the targeted launch of Overa in October 2016 with two key accounts converting from OVA1 to Overa. In October 2015, we announced registration of the CE mark for and clearance to market Overa in the European Union.  We also plan to continue our development of informatics products such as the OVA1 plus test report as well as Laboratory Developed Tests (LDT’s), which we refer to internally as OvaX.  We anticipate that OvaX will include not only biomarkers, but also clinical risk factors, other diagnostics and patient history data in order to boost predictive value.    Mission Statement: We are dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel high-value diagnostic and bio-analytical solutions that help physicians diagnose, treat and improve outcomes for women. Our tests are intended to detect, characterize and stage disease, and to help guide decisions regarding patient treatment, which may include decisions to refer patients to specialists, to perform additional testing, or to assist in monitoring response to therapy. A distinctive feature of our approach is the combination of multi-modal diagnostics and data. Our goal is to combine multiple biomarkers, other modalities and diagnostics, clinical risk factors and patient data into a single, reportable index score that has higher diagnostic accuracy than its constituents. We concentrate our development of novel diagnostic tests for gynecologic disease, with an initial focus on ovarian cancer. We also intend to address clinical questions related to early disease detection, treatment response, monitoring of disease progression, prognosis and others through collaborations with leading academic and research institutions.    Business: Our initial product, OVA1, is a blood test designed to, in addition to a physician’s clinical assessment of a woman with a pelvic mass, identify women who are at high risk of having a malignant ovarian tumor prior to planned surgery. The FDA cleared OVA1 in September 2009, and we commercially launched OVA1 in March 2010. We have launched on a targeted basis a second-generation biomarker panel known as Overa, which is intended to maintain our product’s high sensitivity while improving specificity.  We received FDA clearance for Overa on March 18, 2016. Overa uses the Roche cobas platform.
 ﻿
 In June 2014, we launched ASPiRA LABS, a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) certified national laboratory which specializes in applying biomarker-based technologies, to address critical needs in the management of gynecologic cancers and disease. ASPiRA LABS provides expert diagnostic services using a state-of-the-art biomarker-based diagnostic algorithm to aid in clinical decision making and advance personalized treatment plans. The lab currently processes our OVA1 and Overa tests, and we plan to expand the testing to other gynecologic conditions with high unmet need. We also plan to develop and perform LDTs at ASPiRA LABS.  ASPiRA LABS holds a CLIA Certificate of Registration and a state laboratory license in California, Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. This allows the lab to process OVA1 on a national basis. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued a provider number to ASPiRA LABS in March 2015.
 In 2016, we created a service within the ASPiRA channel strategy, “an ASPiRA IVD Services Program”. In April 2016, we formed ASPiRA IVD to offer IVD trial services to third-party customers. ASPiRA IVD is a specialized laboratory provider dedicated to meeting the unique testing needs of IVD manufacturers seeking to commercialize high-complexity assays. ASPiRA IVD was built around a core of laboratory expertise and an FDA-compliant quality system, and strives to deliver accurate and reliable results to its third-party customers suitable for FDA submission. ASPiRA IVD received a CLIA laboratory license in June 2016 and commenced operations in the second quarter of 2016.

In the ASPiRA IVD program, we are leveraging our existing infrastructure and enhancing our pipeline of future technologies by fostering relationships with IVD companies that are developing new diagnostics including companion diagnostics platforms. We believe this approach will allow us to continue to be innovative in evaluating potential diagnostics. Our goal with the addition of this line of business is to invest in our short-term and long-term enterprise value while leveraging specimen bank, database, FDA experience, laboratory informatics and operating efficiency.
 In the first half of 2017, ASPiRA IVD services landed two top pharmaceutical trial service agreements including one enrollment study.    Strategy: We are focused on the execution of five core strategic business drivers in ovarian cancer diagnostics and specialized laboratory services to build long-term value for our investors: 
 ﻿

1) | Maximizing the existing OVA1 opportunity in the United States by leading in payer coverage and commercialization of OVA1. This strategy included the launch of a CLIA certified clinical laboratory, ASPiRA LABS, in June 2014, multiple publications, inclusion in the ACOG adnexal mass guidelines, payer traction and finally the addition of OVA1 to CMS National Fee schedule as of January 2018; 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

2) | Expanding the distribution platform beyond the U.S. by launching Overa, a next generation biomarker panel, on a targeted basis while building the clinical utility and health economics foundation of both OVA1 and Overa, which we believe may allow for better domestic market penetration and international expansion (FDA clearance for Overa was received in March 2016); 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

3) | Leveraging our existing database and specimen bank while building the largest specimen and data repository of gynecologic pelvic mass patients worldwide;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

4) | Expanding our product offerings to additional pelvic disease conditions such as endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome (“PCOS”) by adding additional gynecologic bio-analytic solutions involving biomarkers, other modalities (e.g., imaging), clinical risk factors and patient data to aid diagnosis and risk stratification of women presenting with a pelvic mass disease; and 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

5) | Expanding our revenue channels and customer offerings with the launch of our ASPiRA IVD laboratory services.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 We believe that these business drivers will contribute significantly to addressing unmet medical needs for women faced with gynecologic disease and other conditions and the continued development of our business.
 Our Product
 OVA1 addresses a clear clinical need, namely the pre-surgical identification of women who are at high risk of having a malignant ovarian tumor. Numerous studies have documented the benefit of referral of these women to gynecologic oncologists for their initial surgery. Prior to the clearance of OVA1, no blood test had been cleared by the FDA for physicians to use in the pre-surgical management of ovarian adnexal masses. OVA1 and Overa are qualitative serum tests that utilize five well-established biomarkers and proprietary software cleared as part of the OVA1 510(k) to determine the likelihood of malignancy in women over age 18, with a pelvic mass for whom surgery is planned. OVA1 or Overa should not be used without an independent clinical/radiological evaluation and is not intended to be a screening test or to determine whether a patient should proceed to surgery. Incorrect use of OVA1 or Overa carries the risk of unnecessary testing, surgery and/or delayed diagnosis. OVA1 was developed through large pre-clinical studies in collaboration with numerous academic medical centers encompassing over 2,500 clinical samples. OVA1 was fully validated in a prospective multi-center clinical trial encompassing 27 sites reflective of the diverse nature of the clinical centers at which ovarian adnexal masses are evaluated.
 In March 2015, we entered into a new commercial agreement with Quest Diagnostics.  Pursuant to this agreement, all OVA1 U.S. testing services for Quest Diagnostics customers were transferred to Vermillion’s wholly-owned subsidiary, ASPiRA LABS, as of August 2015.  Pursuant to this agreement, as amended as of March 1, 2018, Quest Diagnostics is continuing to provide blood draw and logistics support by transporting specimens to ASPiRA LABS for testing through at least March 11, 2019 in exchange for a market value fee.   Per the terms of the new commercial agreement, we will not offer to existing or future Quest Diagnostics customers CA 125-II or other tests that Quest Diagnostics offers.  
 We have active international distribution agreements for Overa with Pro-Genetics LTD in Israel and MacroHealth, Inc. in the Philippines. The MacroHealth agreement was our first decentralized international agreement with Overa specimen testing to be performed in the Philippines.

Novitas Solutions, the Medicare contractor, covers and reimburses for OVA1. This local coverage determination from Novitas Solutions essentially provides national coverage for patients enrolled in Medicare as well as Medicare Advantage health plans. However, ASPiRA LABS initially experienced difficulty in obtaining payment from Novitas Solutions for most claims submitted due to Novitas Solutions’ administrative requirements. In October 2016, Novitas Solutions updated its administrative requirements for OVA1 reimbursement which has improved our ability to obtain reimbursement for OVA1 from Novitas Solutions.
 ﻿
 In October 2016, we launched our pelvic mass specimen and data repository and began the collection of patient consents under Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) for collection and cataloguing of serum samples for future research purposes.
 In November 2016, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ("ACOG”) issued Practice Bulletin Number 174, which included OVA1 as a “Multivariate Index Assay”. This bulletin outlines ACOG's “new” clinical management guidelines for adnexal mass management.  
 These new clinical management guidelines replace the July 2007 version, Practice Bulletin Number 83. Practice Bulletins summarize current information on techniques and clinical management issues for the practice of obstetrics and gynecology. Practice Bulletins are evidence-based documents, and recommendations are based on the evidence.   
 Under Practice Bulletin Number 174, the only Level A recommendation for the work up of the adnexal mass is a pelvic ultrasound. If a pelvic ultrasound is unable to definitively diagnose either a benign condition or a malignancy, clinicians have the ability to do a further work up with biomarker panels such as OVA1 (MIA), which has a Level B evidence designation. Based on this, OVA1 has now achieved parity with CA125 as a Level B recommendation for the management of adnexal masses.    In December 2016, we received an FDA Clarification Letter regarding OVA1 and Overa. This letter was in reference to the September 7, 2016 FDA Safety Communication advising women and their physicians against the use of ovarian cancer screening tests for asymptomatic women.
 In order to avoid any confusion, as well as to document the FDA position on OVA1 and Overa, Jeffrey Shuren, M.D, J.D, Director for the Center for Devices and Radiological Health at the FDA, sent a letter to Vermillion, dated December 21, 2016. In the letter, Dr. Shuren stated: “We agree that this safety communication does not apply to Vermillion’s FDA-cleared tests, OVA1 (MIA) and Overa (MIA2G), which are not screening tests for ovarian cancer.”
 “FDA cleared OVA1 (MIA) and Overa (MIA2G) as aids to further assess the likelihood that malignancy is present when the physician’s independent clinical and radiological evaluation does not indicate malignancy. The intended uses of the two assays are the same—to help physicians more reliably identify which patients would benefit from consultation with or referral to a gynecologic oncologist. OVA1 (MIA) and Overa (MIA2G) are indicated for women who present with an adnexal mass.”
     Studies and Publications
 ﻿
 The benefit of OVA1 was established in large clinical studies in collaboration with numerous academic medical centers encompassing over 2,500 clinical samples. OVA1 was fully validated in a prospective multi-center clinical trial encompassing 27 sites reflecting the diverse nature of the clinical centers at which ovarian adnexal masses are evaluated.[1] The results of the clinical trial demonstrated that in a clinical cohort of 516 patients, OVA1, in conjunction with clinical evaluation, was able to identify 95.7% (154/161) of the malignant ovarian tumors overall, and to rule out malignancy with a negative predictive value (“NPV”) of 94.6%  (123/130). At the 2010 International Gynecologic Cancer Society Meeting, data was presented demonstrating the high sensitivity of OVA1 for epithelial ovarian cancers; OVA1 detected 95 out of 96 epithelial ovarian cancer cases for a sensitivity of 99.0%, including 40/41 stage I and stage II epithelial ovarian cancers. These findings resulted in an overall sensitivity of 97.6% for early stage epithelial ovarian cancers, as compared to 65.9% for the previous single-marker CA125 test using the ACOG cutoffs. The improvement in sensitivity was even greater among premenopausal women; for OVA1, sensitivity for early stage epithelial ovarian cancer in premenopausal women was 92.9% compared to CA125 with a 35.7% sensitivity. Overall, OVA1 detected 76% of malignancies missed by the CA125 assay, including all advanced stage malignancies. OVA1 is not indicated for use as a screening or stand-alone diagnostic assay. The study results were published in Obstetrics and Gynecology in 2011.
 ﻿
 In February 2013, results from a second pivotal clinical study of OVA1, called the “OVA500 study” led by Dr. Robert E. Bristow, Director of Gynecologic Oncology Services at University of California Irvine Healthcare, were published in Gynecologic Oncology. The study evaluated OVA1 diagnostic performance in a population of 494 evaluable patients who underwent surgery for an ovarian adnexal mass by a non-gynecologic oncologist. Like the earlier OVA1 validation study, this was a prospective, multi-center study of consecutively enrolled, eligible subjects coordinated through 27 sites across the United States. In the OVA500 study, adnexal surgery patients were only enrolled from non-gynecologic oncology caregivers. As a result, the patient population in this study more

closely resembled the intended use population for routine OVA1 testing: women aged 18 years or older, with an adnexal mass requiring surgery, but not yet referred to a gynecologic oncologist, and for which the mass was determined to be benign or malignant following enrollment in the study. 
 ﻿
 Of the 27 sites in each study, only 10 were common to both studies. Therefore, the two studies collectively evaluated 1,024 eligible subjects at a total of 44 sites. Despite differences in population and the number of sites in the two studies, the sensitivity of OVA1 added to clinical impression (also called OVA1 dual assessment) was identical, at 95.7% (88/92). Overall prevalence of malignancy in the OVA500 study was 18.6% overall (92/494) and 11.2% (31/277) in premenopausal surgery patients. These malignancy rates were lower than the 31.2% (161/516) found previously in the earlier OVA1 validation study. This difference is likely explained by the exclusion of subjects enrolled by gynecologic oncologists, a potentially malignancy-enriched subset of all adnexal mass surgeries. Even so, OVA1 sensitivity was 93.5% (29/31) in premenopausal subjects, with or without clinical assessment. 
 ﻿
 NPV is another critical element of OVA1 performance in the context of a presurgical triage test or referral to a gynecologic oncologist. In the OVA500 study, overall NPV of OVA1 dual assessment was 98.1% (204/208), higher than the 94.6% NPV found in the earlier validation study. In premenopausal subjects, where functional ovarian cysts are more common and gynecologists may elect to operate more frequently, the NPV of OVA1 with or without clinical assessment was 98.6%. In contrast, clinical assessment predicted just 73.9% of malignancies overall, and only 64.5% of premenopausal malignancies. Together, the differential sensitivity and high NPV of OVA1 strongly confirmed previous findings that support the clinical utility of OVA1 in the presurgical triage of patients scheduled for adnexal mass surgery. 
 ﻿
 An important additional finding related to medical necessity was the detection of early stage malignancies, since stage I cancers have a 90-95% 5-year survival rate if appropriately operated and treated. Of the 92 malignancies in OVA500, 35 were early stage and 28 were stage I; 38.0% and 30.4% of all malignancies, respectively. OVA1 standalone sensitivity in stratifying patients as high-risk was 91.4% (32/35) for all early stage and 89.3% (25/28) for stage I malignancies, respectively. Comparatively, CA 125-II sensitivity was 65.7% (23/35) for all early stage and 64.3% (18/28) for stage I malignancies, respectively. The success rate of OVA1 classifying a benign mass as low risk, although of secondary importance (considering surgery will be performed regardless), was also measured in the OVA500 study. This statistic (specificity) was 53.5% (215/402) overall, and in premenopausal patients was 61.4% (151/246). Overall, the results strongly and independently confirmed the value of OVA1 in the presurgical risk assessment for ovarian cancer and the appropriate triage of women with adnexal masses, even in premenopausal women and in masses that had early stage cancers.
 ﻿
 In May 2013, the SGO issued a position statement on OVA1. This second SGO statement on OVA1 since its FDA clearance in 2009 represented another significant step toward acceptance of OVA1 as the standard of care for presurgically evaluating the risk of ovarian cancer in women with adnexal masses. The statement, titled “Multiplex Serum Testing for Women with Pelvic Mass”, reads: 
 “Blood levels of five proteins in women with a known ovarian mass have been reported to change when ovarian cancer is present. Tests measuring these proteins may be useful in identifying women who should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist. Recent data have suggested that such tests, along with physician clinical assessment, may improve detection rates of malignancies among women with pelvic masses planning surgery.[1],[2] Results from such tests should not be interpreted independently, nor be used in place of a physician’s clinical assessment. Physicians are strongly encouraged to reference the ACOG’s 2011 Committee Opinion “The Role of the Obstetrician-Gynecologist in the Early Detection of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer” to determine an appropriate care plan for their patients. It is important to note that no such test has been evaluated for use as, nor cleared by, the FDA as a screening tool for ovarian cancer. SGO does not formally endorse or promote any specific products or brands.”
 ﻿
 We believe the position statement does two things: 
     
1. | Lists as references the publications of OVA1's two pivotal clinical studies, comprised of the original FDA validation study published in June 2011 and the OVA500 "intended use" study published in 2013. Together, this offers an extensive, peer-reviewed proof source for physicians and payers to assess OVA1's clinical performance and comparative medical benefits versus today's standard of care.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

2. | Places OVA1 use in the context of current ACOG practice guidelines, where CA125 has been used off-label for many years to predict malignancy before surgery, although with inferior performance as compared to OVA1.

In June 2013, a study was published in Gynecologic Oncology analyzing the medical records of 13,321 women with epithelial ovarian cancer, the most common type of ovarian cancer, diagnosed from 1999 to 2006 in California. [3] Led by Dr. Robert Bristow, this study demonstrated that only 37% of these patients received treatment that adhered to care guidelines established by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (“NCCN”), an alliance of 23 major cancer centers with expert panels that analyze, research and recommend cancer treatments. The work, although initiated separately from any Vermillion-related work, points to a continuing need for better presurgical management of patients at risk for ovarian cancer.    ﻿
 The study also found that surgeons who operated on 10 or more women per year for ovarian cancer, and hospitals that treated 20 or more women a year for ovarian cancer, were more likely to adhere to NCCN guidelines and their patients lived longer. Among women with advanced disease — the stage at which ovarian cancer is usually first found — 35% survived at least five years if their care met the guidelines, compared with 25% of those whose care fell short.
      Results of this study were featured on the front page of The New York Times under the headline, "Widespread Flaws Found in Ovarian Cancer Treatment." According to Dr. Bristow, principal investigator of the study, “If we could just make sure that women get to the people who are trained to take care of them, the impact would be much greater than that of any new chemotherapy drug or biological agent.” (NY Times, March 11, 2013, Denise Grady).    ﻿
 In November 2013, we announced that a new study of OVA1 clinical performance in the presurgical detection of ovarian cancer, entitled “Clinical Performance of a Multivariate Index Assay For Detecting Early-Stage Ovarian Cancer” was published in The American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology.[4] Co-authored by Dr. Robert E. Bristow (University of California Irvine Healthcare) and Dr. Frederick R. Ueland (University of Kentucky), the new analysis focused on presurgical detection of early-stage ovarian cancer among 1,016 ovarian mass surgery patients in two previous pivotal trials conducted in 2007 and 2012. The study compared OVA1 performance in early-stage ovarian cancer to commonly used cancer risk assessment protocols: overall clinical assessment, the CA125 biomarker or modified-American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines for evaluation of suspicious pelvic masses. 
 In a statement regarding this new study, Dr. Bristow stated, “Early-stage ovarian cancer constitutes an important opportunity to improve survival and care for this most deadly gynecologic cancer. However, as evidenced by recent studies, most ovarian cancer patients fail to be referred to the doctors and hospitals best equipped to treat them, resulting in unfortunate consequences. Our new study demonstrates OVA1’s ability to detect the majority of all early-stage ovarian cancers prior to surgery and thereby aid in appropriately involving a gynecologic oncologist in their care. Even among premenopausal patients where primary ovarian cancer prevalence was just 15%, clinical assessment with OVA1 detected stage I ovarian cancer with almost 90% sensitivity. This is a very encouraging development for the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer.” 
 Also in November 2013, we announced that a clinical study published in The American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology reported superior sensitivity of OVA1 for presurgical triage of ovarian cancer, compared with commonly used risk assessment methods.[5] The study compared OVA1 performance to benchmark triage methods, within a combined cohort of 770 ovarian mass surgery patients (including 164 malignancies) from two independent but related OVA1 pivotal trials conducted in 2007 and 2012. The study also compared the actual rate of patient referral from non-specialist physicians to gynecologic oncologists with rates predicted from clinical assessment, OVA1, CA125 or from the modified-American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines. 
 Dr. Robert Bristow, lead author of the study, commented: “Despite widely endorsed treatment standards published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, several studies published earlier this year show that only a minority of ovarian cancer patients actually receive treatment by the doctors and hospitals best equipped to care for them. Our new publication shows that the FDA-cleared OVA1 test achieves significantly higher sensitivity than two commonly used methods. And despite lower specificity, the referral rates predicted by OVA1 were roughly comparable to actual clinical practice.” 
 In March 2014, we announced that a study of OVA1 clinical performance, titled "The Effect of Ovarian Imaging on the Clinical Interpretation of a Multivariate Index Assay," was released as an online advance publication of The American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. The study examines the relationship between two commonly used imaging methods – ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) – and the OVA1 test result, in assessing the risk of ovarian cancer among patients planning surgery for an ovarian mass. We view this study as an initial proof of concept for our planned OvaX products.
 "This new study advances our understanding of how OVA1 and imaging work together in the presurgical assessment of ovarian cancer risk," said study co-author Fred Ueland, M.D., associate professor of gynecologic oncology at the University of Kentucky's Markey Cancer Center. "This is important for two reasons. First, adding OVA1 reduced the number of ovarian cancers missed with imaging alone, by 85-90%. Recent publications have reinforced that the first surgery is an important opportunity to improve ovarian cancer survival by ensuring that cancers are detected earlier and that they are operated on by the most experienced specialists. Second, this study provides new evidence of how menopausal status, imaging and OVA1 score may interrelate."

Dr. Scott Goodrich of the University of Kentucky led the study in collaboration with colleagues Drs. Fred Ueland and Rachel Ware Miller. The authors compared the performance of each imaging method alone, to the performance of OVA1 alone (for risk stratification), as well as in combination with OVA1. In addition, the authors presented logistic regression models showing how menopausal status, high- or low-risk imaging and OVA1 score interact in the assessment of ovarian cancer risk. The researchers concluded that "serum biomarkers and imaging are a complementary set of clinical tools and that when the OVA1 score is further stratified by imaging risk and menopausal status, there is a better understanding of the clinical risk of ovarian malignancy."

  In December 2015, results from a cost-effectiveness analysis study were published in the peer reviewed journal, Current Medical Research & Opinion. The study was co-authored by Dr. Robert E. Bristow and Dr. Gareth K. Forde, clinicians at the University of California at Irvine, and Dr. John Hornberger, a leading health economist at Stanford University School of Medicine. The study, entitled “Cost Effectiveness Analysis of a Multivariate Index Assay compared to Modified ACOG Criteria and CA-125 in the Triage of Women with Adnexal Masses”, compared the cost-effectiveness of triaging ovarian masses using OVA1 versus two important clinical benchmarks: the CA-125 biomarker and the modified ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) guideline for ovarian cancer risk assessment (“mod-ACOG”).
 ﻿
 Study endpoints included treatment costs, quality-adjusted life-years (“QALYs”) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (“ICER”). The health economic model utilized OVA1 performance data from the OVA500 prospective trial, published survival, cost and QALY parameters, and a best-practice patient management decision tree. Several important health economic and quality outcome conclusions were reported in the study:
 ﻿

· | Use of OVA1 resulted in fewer projected re-operations and pre-treatment CT scans versus CA 125-II or mod-ACOG,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | OVA1 was QALY-increasing and cost-effective relative to CA 125-II or mod-ACOG,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | ICERs of $12,189/QALY and $35,094/QALY were calculated for OVA1 versus CA 125-II and mod-ACOG, respectively, resulting in a “cost-effective” outcome based on the $50,000 threshold, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Relative to the best-practice mod-ACOG benchmark, OVA1 projected an annual increase in patient survival and QALY in excess of 1,000 years, when the surgical cohort was projected to national annual adnexal mass surgeries including about 22,000 new cases of ovarian cancer.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 In April 2016, we announced the publication of the first clinical utility data demonstrating that identification of high-risk patients using OVA1 prior to surgery resulted in referral of nearly all patients who had primary ovarian malignancies to gynecologic oncologists. The study, entitled “The clinical utility of an elevated-risk multivariate index assay score in ovarian cancer patients,” was published in the June 2016 issue of the peer-reviewed journal, Current Medical Research & Opinion. The study surveyed physicians who frequently used OVA1, and identified 122 patients who underwent surgery for a pelvic mass after a high-risk OVA1 score was reported. Of these, 65 had a primary ovarian malignancy, while the remainder were benign or had a metastatic cancer of non-ovarian origin. Pre-surgical involvement of a gynecologic oncologist was documented, including referral, consultation or availability on stand-by; and the specialty of the surgeon who performed the adnexal surgery was also recorded. In this cohort, 80% of the patients were referred to a gynecologic oncologist, and an additional 9% had one available if needed in surgery.  94% of the initial surgeries were performed by gynecologic oncologists.   Prior studies in the literature show a 33-60% referral rate in ovarian cancer patients.  This is significant because the NCCN guidelines recommend that all patients with ovarian cancer undergo surgery by a gynecologic oncologist and studies have documented that treatment by a gynecologic oncologist leads to improved outcomes.  The surveys also documented 48% of the primary ovarian malignancies associated with elevated risk OVA1 scores were stage I or II, supporting the clinical validation of OVA1 in detection of early stage ovarian cancer.
 In July 2016, the study on the clinical validation of Overa (MIA2G in peer review literature) was published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology [6]. The data show significant improvement in Overa specificity compared to OVA1, while maintaining strong sensitivity (92% for OVA1 in a 2013 study). We received FDA clearance for Overa in March 2016 and launched Overa on a targeted basis in October 2016.

 In March 2017, we announced the acceptance for publication of the original research titled, “Evaluation of a Validated Biomarker Test in Combination with a Symptom Index (“SI”) to Predict Ovarian Malignancy. In a 2016 study performed with 218 patients who presented with pelvic masses, the combination of SI and OVA1 showed a sensitivity to detect primary ovarian malignancy of 100%, detecting both early and late stage cancers better than either SI or OVA1 alone. Additionally, the negative predictive value of SI and OVA1 combined was also 100%, indicating that all women that tested negative for both tests were certain not to have a primary ovarian malignancy.
 On November 16, 2017, we announced the acceptance and publication of a novel paper, “Economic Impact of Increased Utilization of Multivariate Assay Testing to Guide the Treatment of Ovarian Cancer: Implications for Payers” in the journal American Health and Drug Benefits.
 The paper details the base case of a budget impact model that dynamically tracks the effect of OVA1 adoption in lieu of CA125 in the appropriate patient population on overall cost, both at a plan and per member per month (“PMPM”) level. Claims data from a total of over 92,000 health plan members, comprising over 48,000 commercially insured members and 44,000 Medicare beneficiaries, were used in the development of the model. Sensitivity analysis revealed potential savings of up to $0.17 PMPM for commercially insured patients and up to $0.05 PMPM for Medicare beneficiaries. These results of the budget impact model base case support the use of OVA1 instead of CA125, by indicating that cost-savings can be achieved, while reaping the clinical benefits of improved diagnostic accuracy, early disease detection, and reductions in multiple, and possibly non-medically necessary, referrals to gynecologic oncologists.
 Current and former academic and research institutions that we have or have had collaborations with include the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (“JHU”); the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (“M.D. Anderson”); University College London (“UCL”); the University of Texas Medical Branch (“UTMB”); the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven; Clinic of Gynecology and Clinic of Oncology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital (“Rigshospitalet”); the Ohio State University Office of Sponsored Programs (“OSU”); Stanford; the University of Kentucky (“UK”), UC Irvine and Southern California Permanente Medical Group (“SCPMG”).

 The Diagnostic Market
 The economics of healthcare demand effective and efficient allocation of resources which can be accomplished through disease prevention, early detection of disease leading to early intervention, and diagnostic tools that can triage patients to more appropriate therapy and intervention. In September 2017, Allied Market Research, a market research and business consulting partnership, published a study that forecasts IVD market revenue will reach $84 billion by 2023. We have chosen to concentrate our business focus in the areas of oncology and women’s health where we have established strong key opinion leaders, and provider and patient relationships. Demographic trends suggest that, as the population ages, the burden from gynecologic diseases, including cancers, will increase and the demand for quality diagnostic, prognostic and predictive tests will escalate. In addition, the areas of oncology and women’s health generally lack quality diagnostic tests and, therefore, we believe patient outcomes can be significantly improved by the development of novel diagnostic tests. 
 Our focus on translational biomarkers and informatics enables us to address the market for novel diagnostic tests that simultaneously measure multiple biomarkers. A biomarker is a biomolecule or variant biomolecule that is present at measurably greater or lesser concentrations in a disease state versus a normal condition. Conventional protein tests measure a single protein biomarker whereas most diseases are complex. We believe that efforts to diagnose cancer and other complex diseases have failed in large part because the disease is heterogeneous at the causative level (i.e., most diseases can be traced to multiple potential etiologies) and at the human response level (i.e., each individual afflicted with a given disease can respond to that ailment in a specific manner). 
 Consequently, measuring a single biomarker when multiple biomarkers may be altered in a complex disease is unlikely to provide meaningful information about the disease state. We believe that our approach of monitoring and combining multiple biomarkers using a variety of analytical techniques has allowed and will continue to allow us to create diagnostic tests with sufficient sensitivity and specificity about the disease state to aid the physician considering treatment options for patients with complex diseases. Such assays are commonly referred to as IVDMIA (also known as In Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assays), and often utilize advanced algorithms based on logistic regression, pattern recognition and the like. Often, IVDMIA algorithms are non-intuitive, and therefore require rigorous clinical validation and error modeling. Vermillion and its collaborators are considered experts in these areas and, in the case of OVA1, presented both the clinical validation and error modeling needed in order to gain 510(k) clearance of OVA1 as an IVD software device.
 Ovarian Cancer
 Background    Commonly known as the “silent killer,” ovarian cancer leads to approximately 14,000 deaths each year in the United States. As of early 2018, The American Cancer Society (“ACS”) estimated that over 22,000 new ovarian cancer cases will be diagnosed, with the majority of patients diagnosed in the late stages of the disease in which the cancer has spread beyond the ovary. Unfortunately, ovarian cancer patients in the late stages of the disease have a poor prognosis, which leads to high mortality rates. According to the ACS, when ovarian cancer is diagnosed at its earliest stage, Stage 1A, the patient has a 5-year survival rate of 94%. Ovarian cancer patients have up to a 90% 5-year survival rate following surgery and/or chemotherapy if detected in stage 1. However, only 15% of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed before the tumor has spread outside the ovary. For ovarian cancer patients diagnosed in the late-stages of the disease, the 5-year survival rate falls to as low as 17%.    While the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in its earliest stages greatly increases the likelihood of long-term survival from the disease, another factor that predicts clinical outcomes from ovarian cancer is the specialized training of the surgeon who operates on the ovarian cancer patient. Numerous studies have demonstrated that treatment of malignant ovarian tumors by specialists such as gynecologic oncologists or at specialist medical centers improves outcomes for women with these tumors. Published guidelines from the SGO and the ACOG recommend referral of women with malignant ovarian tumors to specialists. Unfortunately, we believe only about one-third of women with these types of tumors are operated on by specialists, in part because of inadequate diagnostics that can identify such malignancies with high sensitivity. Accordingly, there is a clinical need for a diagnostic test that can provide adequate predictive value to stratify patients with a pelvic mass into those with a high risk of invasive ovarian cancer versus those with a low risk of ovarian cancer, which is essential for improving overall survival in patients with ovarian cancer. 
 Although adnexal masses are relatively common, malignant tumors are less so. Screening studies have indicated that the prevalence of simple ovarian cysts in women 55 years of age and older can be as high as 14%.[1] Adnexal masses are thought to be even more common in premenopausal women, but there are more non-persistent, physiologic ovarian masses in this demographic group. For instance, in the University of Kentucky ovarian cancer screening project, the rate of postmenopausal women with persistently abnormal ultrasound findings requiring surgery was 1.4%.[2]  According to 2010 U.S. census data, there are 36.8 million women between the ages of 50 and 70 in the U.S., suggesting that there are more than 500,000 suspicious adnexal masses in this segment alone. Those that do require evaluation for the likelihood for malignancy could potentially benefit from the use of OVA1 or Overa.
 The ACOG Ovarian Cancer Guidelines and the SGO guidelines help physicians evaluate adnexal masses for malignancy. These guidelines take into account menopausal status, CA125 levels, and physical and imaging findings. However, these guidelines 

 
10

 
have notable shortcomings because of their reliance on diagnostics with certain weaknesses. Most notably, the CA125 blood test, which is cleared by the FDA only for monitoring for recurrence of ovarian cancer, is negative in up to 50% of early stage ovarian cancer cases. Moreover, CA125 can be elevated in numerous conditions and diseases other than ovarian cancer, including benign ovarian masses and endometriosis. These shortcomings limit the CA125 blood test’s utility in distinguishing benign from malignant ovarian tumors or for use in detection of early stage ovarian cancer. Transvaginal ultrasound is another diagnostic modality used with patients with ovarian masses. Attempts at defining specific morphological criteria that can aid in a benign versus malignant diagnosis have led to the morphology index and the risk of malignancy index, with reports of 40-70% predictive value. However, ultrasound interpretation can be variable and dependent on the experience of the operator. Accordingly, the ACOG and SGO guidelines perform only modestly in identifying early stage ovarian cancer and malignancy in pre-menopausal women. Efforts to improve detection of cancer by lowering the cutoff for CA125 (the “Modified ACOG/SGO Guidelines”) provide only a modest benefit, since CA125 is absent in about 20% of epithelial ovarian cancer cases and is poorly detected in early stage ovarian cancer overall.

 Commercialization
 Commercialization through Quest Diagnostics started in 2010 and ended 2015. Starting in 2014, we offered OVA1 via ASPiRA LABS as well.  In March 2015, we entered into a new commercial agreement with Quest Diagnostics.  Pursuant to this agreement, all OVA1 U.S. testing services for Quest Diagnostics customers were transferred to Vermillion’s wholly-owned subsidiary, ASPiRA LABS.  Pursuant to this agreement as amended, Quest Diagnostics is continuing to provide blood draw and logistics support by transporting specimens to ASPiRA LABS for testing through at least March 11, 2019 in exchange for a market value fee.  Per the terms of the agreement, we will not offer to existing or future Quest Diagnostics customers CA 125-II or other tests that Quest Diagnostics offers. Customers
 In the United States, the IVD market can be segmented into three major groups: clinical reference laboratories, the largest of which are Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America, hospital laboratories, and physician offices.  In 2015, our revenue was generated through Quest Diagnostics and ASPiRA LABS and, since 2016, solely through ASPiRA LABS and ASPiRA IVD.  Both within and outside the United States, laboratories may become customers, either directly with us or via distribution relationships established between us and authorized distributors.  Research and Development
 Our research and development efforts center on the discovery and validation of biomarkers and combinations of biomarkers that can be developed into diagnostic assays. We have done this predominantly through collaborations we have established with academic institutions such as JHU and M.D. Anderson as well as through contract research organizations such as PrecisionMed, Inc. In addition, we actively seek collaborations and initiate dialog with clinical academics, in order to generate publications, intellectual property or test development in broader areas of gynecologic oncology and other gynecologic diseases.
 Our research and development expenses were $837,000 and $2,172,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to the expiration of our collaboration agreement with JHU in March 2016 as well as lower personnel and personnel-related expenses due to the clearance of Overa in March 2016. Also, in October 2016, we began the collection of patient consents under IRB for collection and cataloguing of serum samples for future research purposes at a much lower cost.
 Scientific Background
 Genes are the hereditary coding system of living organisms. Genes encode proteins that are responsible for cellular functions. The study of genes and their functions has led to the discovery of new targets for drug development. Industry sources estimate that, within the human genome, there are approximately 30,000 genes. Although the primary structure of a protein is determined by a gene, the active structure of a protein is frequently altered by interactions with additional genes or proteins. These subsequent modifications result in hundreds of thousands of different proteins. In addition, proteins may interact with one another to form complex structures that are ultimately responsible for cellular functions. 
 Genomics allows researchers to establish the relationship between gene activity and disease. However, many diseases are manifested not at the genetic level, but at the protein level. The complete structure of modified proteins cannot be determined by reference to the encoding gene alone. Thus, while genomics provides some information about diseases, it does not provide a full understanding of disease processes. We are focused on converting advances in proteomics into clinically useful diagnostic tests.

Relationship Between Proteins and Diseases 
 The entire genetic content of any organism, known as its genome, is encoded in strands of deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”). Cells perform their normal biological functions through the genetic instructions encoded in their DNA, which results in the production of proteins. The process of producing proteins from DNA is known as gene expression or protein expression. Differences in living organisms result from variability in their genomes, which can affect the types of genes expressed and the levels of gene expression. Each cell of an organism expresses only approximately 10% to 20% of the genome. The type of cell determines which genes are expressed and the amount of a particular protein produced. For example, liver cells produce different proteins from those produced by cells found in the heart, lungs, skin, etc. Proteins play a crucial role in virtually all biological processes, including transportation and storage of energy, immune protection, generation and transmission of nerve impulses and control of growth. Diseases may be caused by a mutation of a gene that alters a protein directly or indirectly, or alters the level of protein expression. These alterations interrupt the normal balance of proteins and create disease symptoms. A protein biomarker is a protein or protein variant that is present in a greater or lesser amount in a disease state versus a normal condition. By studying changes in protein biomarkers, researchers may identify diseases prior to the appearance of physical symptoms. Historically, researchers discovered protein biomarkers as a byproduct of basic biological disease research, which resulted in the validation by researchers of approximately 200 protein biomarkers that are being used in commercially available clinical diagnostic products.  Limitations of Existing Diagnostic Approaches 
 The IVD industry manufactures and distributes products that are used to detect thousands of individual components present in human derived specimens. However, the vast majority of these assays are used specifically to identify single protein biomarkers. The development of new diagnostic products has been limited by the complexity of disease states, which may be caused or characterized by several or many proteins or post-translationally modified protein variants. Diagnostic assays that are limited to the detection of a single protein often have limitations in clinical specificity (true negatives) and sensitivity (true positives) due to the complex nature of many diseases and the inherent biological diversity among populations. Diagnostic products that are limited to the detection of a single protein may lack the ability to detect more complex diseases, and thus produce results that are unacceptable for practical use. The heterogeneity of disease and of the human response to disease often underlies the shortcoming of single biomarkers to diagnose and predict many diseases accurately.  Our Solution 
 Our studies in ovarian cancer have given us a better understanding of both the disease pathophysiology and the host response. By using multiple biomarkers rather than a single biomarker, we are able to better characterize the disease and host response heterogeneity. In addition, by examining specific biomarkers and their variants (e.g., post-translational modifications), we believe we can improve sensitivity and specificity over traditional diagnostic biomarkers because these biomarker combinations reflect both the pathophysiology and host response. This is accomplished using novel biomarker panels coupled with multivariate pattern recognition software to identify IVDMIA algorithms which can be commercialized as disease-specific assays. 
 We are applying translational biomarker research, algorithm development tools, and statistical error modeling methods to discover robust associations between biomarker panels and clinically relevant disease endpoints. We plan to develop new IVDMIA algorithms and diagnostic tests based on known and newly identified protein markers to help physicians better predict and manage disease and treatment, and thereby improve patient outcomes and overall health economic resource utilization. Examples of diagnostic applications include, but are not limited to: asymptomatic population screening, early detection, triage to specialists, aid in diagnosis, prognosis or disease sub-classification, prediction or selection of therapy, monitoring of therapeutic response or residual disease, monitoring for recurrence or identification of appropriate fallback therapy or clinical trial eligibility.    We anticipate partnerships with leading scientific and clinical institutions who have active proteomic or genomic programs in the area of gynecologic cancers, or with relevant clinical trial interests, with the goal of expanding our product portfolio with relevant solutions to unmet medical needs in women’s health.
 Addressing the Heterogeneity of Disease 
 Our approach is to create a diagnostics paradigm that is based on risk estimation, multiple-biomarker testing and information integration. This is based on the belief that cancer and other gynecologic diseases are heterogeneous and, therefore, that relying on a single disease biomarker to provide a simple “yes-no” answer is likely to fail. We believe that efforts to diagnose cancer and other complex diseases have failed in large part because the disease is heterogeneous at the causative level, meaning that most diseases can be traced to multiple potential etiologies, and at the individual response level, meaning that each individual afflicted with a given disease can respond to that ailment in a specific manner. Consequently, diagnosis, disease monitoring and treatment decisions can be challenging. This heterogeneity of disease and difference in human response to disease and/or treatment underlies the shortcomings of single biomarkers to predict and identify many diseases. A better understanding of heterogeneity of disease and human response is necessary for improved diagnosis and treatment of many diseases.

While our focus on supporting the commercialization of OVA1 is our primary priority, we also may extend our ovarian cancer franchise beyond OVA1, enabled by several factors:  

· | We received FDA clearance of a product improvement to OVA1, known as Overa, in March 2016;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The collection of clinical samples from prospectively enrolled adnexal surgery patients enables further biomarker and bio-analytical research, both in detection of ovarian cancer and also markers and risk factors for other gynecologic diseases which present with similar signs and symptoms;

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our success in translating biomarkers into FDA-cleared, widely available commercial products creates increasing interest in licensing, co-marketing and/or acquisition of intellectual property and products from academics and technology providers. We believe we are well-positioned in gynecologic health markets to launch new products developed, licensed, co-marketed or acquired by any of these routes.

  ﻿
 Commercial Operations
 We have a commercial infrastructure, including sales and marketing and reimbursement expertise. We also operate a national CLIA certified clinical laboratory, ASPiRA LABS. Our sales representatives work to identify opportunities for educating general gynecologists and gynecologic oncologists on the benefits of OVA1. In February 2015, Vermillion received ISO 13485:2003 certification for our quality management system from the British Standards Institution (BSI), one of the world's leading certification bodies. In March 2015, we announced that OVA1 was CE marked, a requirement for marketing the test in the European Union. In October 2015, we announced registration of the CE mark for and clearance to market Overa in the European Union. We are targeting markets outside of the United States now that we have Overa cleared on the Roche cobas platform, which is available globally. In 2016, we signed our first contracts with distributors outside the United States so that we could begin marketing Overa and OVA1 outside the United States in 2017.    Approximately 8,575 OVA1 tests were performed in 2017 compared to 9,125 in 2016, with the decrease being attributed to the loss of a large reference laboratory account in July 2017. In 2017, we continued to develop the market through experienced market development specialists, and customer account managers.  As market awareness continues to build, these managers are focused on efforts that will have a positive impact on regional payers and create positive coverage decisions.  They are working with local key opinion leaders and meeting with medical directors to discuss the clinical need, our technology assessment package and increasing experience and cases studies showing the positive outcomes utilizing OVA1.  
 There are still obstacles to overcome and significant milestones ahead.  First, the average gynecologist will only see about 2 to 4 patients per month who may need our test, and additional effort will be required to establish a consistent ordering pattern.  Second, despite gains in positive medical policy coverage and contract agreements, insurance coverage and patient bills remain a concern to the physician and can disrupt the ordering pattern of a generalist who is supportive of OVA1. We have instituted a “Patient Advocacy Program” to assist with this process to proactively assess insurance and educate patients on testing costs prior to testing being performed.
 Reimbursement
 In the United States, revenue for diagnostic tests comes from several sources, including third-party payers such as insurance companies, government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, client bill accounts and patients. Novitas Solutions, the Medicare contractor for areas including Texas, now covers and reimburses ASPiRA LABS for OVA1. The local coverage determination from Novitas Solutions essentially provides national coverage for patients enrolled in Medicare as well as Medicare Advantage health plans. ASPiRA LABS also bills third-party commercial and other government payers as well as client bill accounts and patients for OVA1.
 In December 2013, the CMS made its final determination and authorized Medicare contractors to set prices for Multianalyte Assays with Algorithmic Analyses (“MAAA”) test CPT codes when they determine it is payable.  In late 2016, OVA1 was included on the list of clinical diagnostic laboratory test procedure codes as one for which the CMS would require reporting of private payer rates as part of the implementation of Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”). In November 2017, we announced that the CMS released the Final 2018 Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (“CLFS”), effective January 1, 2018. Under the new fee schedule, the price for 

 
13

 
OVA1(MIA) (code 81503) is $897. This is a four-fold increase over the previous CMS rate, and this new rate was based on the median of private payer payments submitted to CMS by companies, including ASPiRA Labs, as part of the market-based payment reform mandated through PAMA. The rate is scheduled to be in effect for a three-year term from January 2018 through December 2020.
 CMS also published a final price for Overa of $950, which was benchmarked to the only proteomic test currently on the CLFS that uses biomarkers and an algorithm to produce a prognostic score. The rate is scheduled to be in effect for a three-year term from January 2018 through December 2020.    Starting in 2016, we were able to make progress in achieving positive medical policy and/or payer contracts. We have continued to make progress with increased payer positive medical polices for an estimated total of over 125 million covered lives as of March 1, 2018.  This represents an increase from an estimated 80 million covered lives as of December 31, 2016.
 New and innovative diagnostic tests often face reimbursement challenges that can affect adoption, including:  
 ﻿
 Coding

· | We received an American Medical Association (“AMA”) Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) Category I code specific for OVA1, which was effective beginning January 1, 2013. Achieving the unique Category I CPT code # 81503 was a critical step in our commercialization process.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We received a Proprietary Laboratory Analyses (PLA) code #0003U for Overa from the AMA’s CPT® Editorial Panel effective January 1, 2017. This new code is included in the first set of PLA codes to be released by the AMA to support the implementation of Section 216 of PAMA, which replaces the current Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule with a new fee schedule based upon laboratory-reported private payer rates. PLA codes are proprietary clinical laboratory analyses that can be either provided by a single (“sole-source”) laboratory or licensed or marketed to multiple providing laboratories (e.g., cleared or approved by the FDA).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Claims Process

· | In the launch of a product, claims can be rejected due to lack of medical necessity, lack of payer understanding, or even billing process errors. To address these items, ASPiRA LABS expanded its patient advocacy program nationally in July 2017 to assist patients with proactive benefit checks, with over 90% resulting in OVA1 utilization. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Payer Coverage

· | We have continued to focus ongoing efforts toward obtaining national coverage decisions. However, these decisions typically have a much longer lead time due to industry established processes and time frames. In most cases, these entail clinical and technical reviews that are performed on an annual basis. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We have launched a program to aid local key opinion leaders to work with health plans to support coverage for OVA1. These strategic actions are necessary steps to convert those plans representing numerous regional payers and late adopters. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Competition
 The diagnostics industry in which we operate is competitive and evolving. There is intense competition among healthcare, biotechnology and diagnostics companies attempting to discover candidates for potential new diagnostic products. These companies may: 
· | develop new diagnostic products in advance of us or our collaborators;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | develop diagnostic products that are more effective or cost-effective than those developed by us or our collaborators;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | obtain regulatory clearance or approval of their diagnostic products more rapidly than us or our collaborators; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would limit our or our collaborators’ ability to develop and commercialize, or a customers’ ability to use our or our collaborators’ diagnostic products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We compete with companies in the United States and abroad that are engaged in the development and commercialization of novel biomarkers that may form the basis of novel diagnostic tests. These companies may develop products that are competitive with and/or perform the same or similar functions as the products offered by us or our collaborators, such as biomarker specific reagents or diagnostic test kits. Also, clinical laboratories may offer testing services that are competitive with the products sold by us or our collaborators. For example, a clinical laboratory can either use reagents purchased from manufacturers other than us or use its own internally developed reagents to make diagnostic tests. If clinical laboratories make tests in this manner for a particular disease, they 

 
14

 
could offer testing services for that disease as an alternative to products sold by us used to test for the same disease. The testing services offered by clinical laboratories may be easier to develop and market than test kits developed by us or our collaborators because the testing services are not subject to the same clinical validation requirements that are applicable to FDA-cleared or approved diagnostic test kits.
 Fujirebio Diagnostics sells Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (“ROMA”). ROMA combines two tumor markers and menopausal status into a numerical score using a publicly available algorithm.  This test has the same intended use and precautions as OVA1. ROMA is currently marketed as having utility limited to epithelial ovarian cancers, which accounts for 80% of ovarian malignancies. Based upon the results of a 2013 study, we believe that OVA1 has superior performance when compared to the Fujirebio Diagnostics test.

In addition, competitors such as Becton Dickinson and Abbott Laboratories have publicly disclosed that they have been or are currently working on ovarian cancer diagnostic assays. Academic institutions periodically report new findings in ovarian cancer diagnostics that may have commercial value. 
 ﻿
 Intellectual Property Protection
 Our intellectual property includes the registered trademarks for Vermillion, OVA1, Overa and OvaCalc and a portfolio of owned, co-owned or licensed patents and patent applications. As of December 31, 2017, our clinical diagnostics patent portfolio included 20 issued United States patents, 9 pending United States patent applications, and numerous pending patent applications and issued patents outside the United States. These patents and patent applications fall into 24 patent families and are directed to diagnostic technologies.

Our research collaboration agreement with JHU expired in March 2016.  There were no JHU collaboration costs in 2017. Collaboration costs with JHU were $264,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, under the terms of our amended research collaboration agreement with JHU, we are required to pay the greater of 4% royalties on net sales of diagnostic tests using the assigned patents or annual minimum royalties of $57,500.    Manufacturing
 We are the manufacturer of OVA1 and Overa. Components of OVA1 and Overa include purchased reagents for each of the component assays as well as the OvaCalc® software. Because we do not directly manufacture the component assays, we are required to maintain supply agreements with manufacturers of each of the assays. As part of our quality systems, reagent lots for these assays are tested to ensure they meet specifications required for inclusion in OVA1 and Overa. Only reagent lots determined by us as having met these specifications are permitted for use in OVA1 and Overa. Our principal suppliers are Roche Diagnostics Corporation and Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Inc.
 Environmental Matters
 Medical Waste
 We are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws relating to the handling and disposal of medical specimens and hazardous waste as well as to the safety and health of laboratory employees. ASPiRA LABS and ASPiRA IVD are operated in material compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to disposal of all laboratory specimens. We utilize outside vendors for disposal of specimens. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. We could be subject to fines, penalties and damages claims in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials. In addition, claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use, or the use by third parties, of these materials, and our liability may exceed our total assets. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Occupational Safety
 In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis virus. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to chemicals and transmission of the blood-borne and airborne pathogens. Although we believe that we have complied in all material respects with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions.


 
15

 
Specimen Transportation
 Regulations of the Department of Transportation, the International Air Transportation Agency, the Public Health Service and the Postal Service apply to the surface and air transportation of clinical laboratory specimens. Although we believe that we have complied in all material respects with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions.
 ﻿
 Government Regulation
 General. Our activities related to diagnostic products are, or have the potential to be, subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing and export of our products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act requires that medical devices introduced to the United States market, unless exempted by regulation, be the subject of either a pre-market notification clearance, known as a 510(k) clearance or 510(k) de novo clearance, or a pre-market approval (“PMA”). OVA1 was cleared by the FDA in September 2009 under the 510(k) de novo guidelines.  OVA1 was the first FDA-cleared blood test for the pre-operative assessment of ovarian masses. We received 510(k) clearance for Overa, our second-generation biomarker panel in March 2016.    Even in the case of devices like analyte specific reagents (“ASRs”), which may be exempt from 510(k) clearance or PMA approval requirements, the FDA may impose restrictions on marketing. Our potential future ASR products may be sold only to clinical laboratories certified under CLIA to perform high complexity testing. In addition to requiring approval or clearance for new products, the FDA may require approval or clearance prior to marketing products that are modifications of existing products or the intended uses of these products. Additionally, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection for PMA devices. Our suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic and unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with Quality System Regulations (“QSRs”). Although we believe that we and our suppliers will be able to operate in compliance with the FDA’s QSRs for ASRs, we cannot ensure that we or our suppliers will be in or be able to maintain compliance in the future. We passed an FDA inspection in 2016.  However, we cannot ensure that we will pass any future inspection, if and when it occurs. If the FDA believes that we or our suppliers are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the FDA can issue a Form 483 List of Observations or warning letter, detain or seize our products, issue a recall notice, enjoin future violations and assess civil and criminal penalties against us. In addition, approvals or clearances could be withdrawn under certain circumstances.
     ASPiRA LABS and any customers using our products for clinical use in the United States may be regulated under CLIA, which is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. The regulations promulgated under CLIA establish three levels of diagnostic tests - namely, waived, moderately complex and highly complex - and the standards applicable to a clinical laboratory depend on the level of the tests it performs. 
 FDA Regulation of Cleared Tests.  Once granted, a 510(k) clearance or PMA approval may place substantial restrictions on how our device is marketed or to whom it may be sold. All devices cleared by the FDA are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. As a medical device manufacturer, we are also required to register and list our products with the FDA. We are required to set forth and adhere to a quality policy and other regulations. In addition, we are required to comply with the FDA’s QSRs, which require that our devices be manufactured and records be maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. Additionally, we may be subject to inspection by federal and state regulatory agencies. Non-compliance with these standards can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, and total or partial suspension of production. Further, we are required to comply with FDA requirements for labeling and promotion. For example, the FDA prohibits cleared or approved devices from being promoted for uncleared or unapproved uses. Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA, which prohibits the marketing of medical devices for unapproved uses. Additionally, the FDA requires us to perform certain post-marketing studies to verify or validate the clinical performance of FDA-cleared tests, as is permitted by their statutory authority. Failure to comply with our post-marketing study requirements may lead to enforcement actions by the FDA, including seizure of our product, injunction, prosecution and/or civil money penalties.
 ﻿
 In addition, the medical device reporting regulation requires that we provide information to the FDA whenever evidence reasonably suggests that one of our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or where a malfunction has occurred that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur.
 ﻿
 Foreign Government Regulation of Our Products. We intend to obtain regulatory approval in other countries to market our tests. Medical device laws and regulations are in effect in many of the countries in which we may do business outside the United States. These range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our potential future medical device products, to requests for product data or certifications. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. In addition, products which have not yet been cleared or approved for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to the FDA Export Reform and

Enhancement Act of 1996. Each country also maintains its own regulatory review process, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements, product standards, and labeling requirements. In February 2015, Vermillion also received ISO 13485:2003 certification for our quality management system from the British Standards Institution (BSI), one of the world's leading certification bodies. In March 2015, OVA1 was CE marked, a requirement for marketing the test in the European Union. In October 2015, we announced registration of the CE mark for and clearance to market Overa in the European Union.
