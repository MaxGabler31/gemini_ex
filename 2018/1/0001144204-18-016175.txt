Business Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of cancer. Our core objective is to leverage our proprietary phospholipid drug conjugateTM (PDCsTM) delivery platform to develop PDCs that specifically target cancer cells to deliver improved efficacy and better safety as a result of fewer off-target effects. The PDCTM platform possesses the potential for the discovery and development of the next generation of cancer-targeting treatments and we plan to develop PDCs independently and through research and development collaborations.
 
Our lead PDC candidate, CLR 131, provides targeted delivery of the cytotoxic (cell-killing) radioisotope iodine 131. CLR 131 is in a Phase 1 clinical study for relapsed or refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM) and a Phase 2 clinical study in R/R MM and a range of other B-cell malignancies. The company plans to initiate a Phase 1 study for pediatric solid tumors and lymphomas and a second Phase 1 study of CLR 131 in combination with external beam radiation for head and neck cancer. The company’s pipeline also includes two pre-clinical PDC chemotherapeutic programs, CLR 1700 and 1900. CLR 1700 possess a Burton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTK) payload and is targeted for development in hematologic cancers and CLR 1900 is being developed for solid tumors with a payload that inhibits mitosis (cell division) which is a validated pathway for cell apoptosis.
 
We have leveraged our PDC platform to establish three active collaborations featuring four unique payloads and mechanisms of action. Through research and development collaborations, our strategy is to generate near-term capital, supplement internal resources, gain access to novel molecules or payloads, accelerate product candidate development and broaden our proprietary and partnered product pipelines.
 
Our PDC platform provides selective delivery of a diverse range of oncologic payloads to cancerous cells, whether a hematologic cancer or solid tumor, the primary tumor, or a metastatic tumor and cancer stem cells. Our PDC platform takes advantage of a metabolic pathway utilized by all tumor cell types in all stages of the tumor “cycle.” This allows the PDC molecules to gain access to the intracellular compartment of the tumor cells and for the PDCs to continue to accumulate over time, which enhances drug efficacy. The PDC platform’s mechanism of entry does not rely upon specific cell surface epitopes or antigens as are required by other targeted delivery platforms. Specific cell surface epitopes are limited in number on the cell surface, undergo internalization and cycling upon binding and are not present on all tumor cells of a particular cancer type. This means a subpopulation of tumor cells will always remain. In addition to the benefits provided by the mechanism of entry, PDCs offer the potential advantage of having the ability to be conjugated to molecules in numerous ways, thereby increasing the types of molecules selectively delivered via the PDC.


The PDC platform features include the capacity to link with almost any molecule, provide a significant increase in targeted oncologic payload delivery and the ability to target all tumor cells. As a result, we believe that we can generate PDCs to treat a broad range of cancers with the potential to improve the therapeutic index of oncologic drug payloads, enhance or maintain efficacy while reducing adverse events by minimizing drug delivery to healthy cells, and increasing delivery to cancerous cells and cancer stem cells.
 
We employ a drug discovery and development approach that allows us to efficiently design, research and advance drug candidates. Our iterative process allows us to rapidly and systematically produce multiple generations of incrementally improved targeted drug candidates.

A description of our PDC product candidates follows:
 

• | CLR 131 is a small-molecule, cancer-targeting radiotherapeutic PDC designed to deliver cytotoxic radiation directly and selectively to cancer cells and cancer stem cells. CLR 131 is our lead therapeutic PDC product candidate and is currently being evaluated in both Phase 2 and Phase 1 clinical studies. The Investigational New Drug (IND) application was accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2014. In December 2014, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for CLR 131 for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) and the Phase 1 study was initiated in April 2015. This clinical study is a standard three-by-three dose escalation safety study in patients with relapse or refractory multiple myeloma (R/RMM). Multiple myeloma is an incurable cancer of the plasma cells and is the second most common form of hematologic cancers. This cancer type was selected for clinical, regulatory and commercial rationales, including multiple myeloma’s highly radiosensitive nature, and continued unmet medical need in the relapse/refractory setting and has been determined to be a rare disease by the FDA based upon the current definition within the Orphan Drug Act. The primary goal of the Phase 1 study is to assess the compound’s safety and tolerability in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Secondary objectives include the establishment of a recommended Phase 2 dose, both with and without dexamethasone, as well as an evaluation of therapeutic activity by assessing surrogate efficacy markers which include M protein, Free Light Chain (FLC), Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS). In March 2018, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for CLR 131 for the treatment of neuroblastoma. The FDA previously accepted our IND application for a Phase 1 open-label, dose-escalating study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous administration of CLR 131 in up to 30 children and adolescents with cancers including neuroblastoma, sarcomas, lymphomas (including Hodgkin’s lymphoma) and malignant brain tumors. We expect to initiate this study during the second quarter of 2018.

Phase 2 Study in Patients with R/R select B-Cell Malignancies
 
In July 2016, we were awarded a $2,000,000 National Cancer Institute Fast-Track Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant to further advance the clinical development of CLR 131. The funds are supporting the Phase 2 study initiated in March 2017 to define the clinical benefits of CLR 131 in R/RMM and other niche hematologic malignancies with high unmet clinical need. These niche hematologic malignancies include Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, Marginal Zone Lymphoma, Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma, and Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma. The study will be conducted in approximately 10 top U.S. cancer centers in patients with orphan-designated relapse or refractory hematologic cancers. The study's primary endpoint is clinical benefit response (CBR), with additional endpoints of progression free survival PFS, median OS and other markers of efficacy following a single 25.0 mCi/m2 dose of CLR 131, with the option for a second 25.0 mCi/m2 dose approximately 75-180 days later.
 
Phase 1 Study in Patients with R/R Multiple Myeloma
 
In September 2017, Cohort 4 results were announced and these results showed that a single 30 minute infusion of 31.25mCi/m2 of CLR 131 was safe and well tolerated by the three patients in the cohort. Additionally, all three patients experienced clinical benefit with one patient achieving a Partial Response (PR). We are monitoring response rates via surrogate markers of efficacy including M protein and free light chain FLC. The International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) defines a partial response PR as a greater than or equal to 50 percent decrease in FLC levels (for patients in whom M protein is unmeasurable) or 50 percent decrease in M protein. The patient experiencing a partial response had an 82 percent reduction in FLC. This patient did not produce M protein, received seven prior lines of treatment including radiation, stem cell transplantation and multiple triple combination treatments including one with daratumumab that was not tolerated. One patient experiencing stable disease attained a 44 percent reduction in M protein.
 
The key clinical outcome for R/RMM patients is OS. Patients in the Phase 1 dose escalation study have attained the following Median OS as of November 3, 2017: Cohort 3 patients (single 25.0 mCi/m2 dose) at 10 months, Cohort 2 patients (single 18.75mCi/m2 dose) at 15.4 months and Cohort 1 (single 12.5mCi/m2 dose) at 26.2 months. At the time of this document, Median OS data are still being collected and therefore should not be considered quality controlled final data.

Phase 1 Study in R/R Pediatric Patients with select Solid tumors, Lymphomas and Malignant Brain Tumors.
 
On December 14, 2017, we filed an IND application with the Division of Oncology at the FDA for a proposed Phase 1 study of CLR 131 in children and adolescents with select rare and orphan designated cancers. The Phase 1 clinical trial of CLR 131 is an open-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous administration of CLR 131 in up to 30 children and adolescents with cancers including neuroblastoma, sarcomas, lymphomas (including Hodgkin's lymphoma) and malignant brain tumors. Secondary objectives of the study are to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose of CLR 131 and to determine preliminary antitumor activity (treatment response) of CLR 131 in children and adolescents. In March 2018, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for CLR 131 for the treatment of neuroblastoma, a rare pediatric cancer. We expect to initiate the Phase 1 study during the second quarter of 2018.

The study will be initiated with the pediatric oncologists and Nuclear Medicine/Radiology Group at the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC). Investigators at The University of Wisconsin have demonstrated uptake of CLR 131 and other fluorescently and isotopically tagged PDCs across a wide range of childhood solid cancer cell lines including, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, pediatric brain tumors such as high-grade gliomas, medulloblastoma and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor. In subsequent testing in mouse xenograft models of neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma, CLR 131 provided significant benefits on tumor growth rates and survival.
 
Phase 1 Study in R/R Head and Neck Cancer
 
In August 2016, the UWCCC was awarded a five year Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE) grant from the National Cancer Institute to improve treatments and outcomes for head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. HNC is the sixth most common cancer across the world with approximately 56,000 new patients diagnosed every year in the United States. As a key component of this grant, the UWCCC researchers will test CLR 131 in various animal HNC models as well as initiating the first human clinical trial combining CLR 131 and external beam radiation in patients with recurrent HNC. The UWCCC is currently anticipated to initiate this clinical trial in 2H 2018.
 
Pre-Clinical Pipeline
 

• | CLR 1700 Series is an internally developed PDC program leveraging a payload which inhibits Burton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and is designed to treat a broad range of hematologic cancers. The payload provides further specificity by targeting a pathway within hematologic cancers that is significantly upregulated in comparison to normal tissue. We believe that this additional level of targeting will allow us to provide a new drug candidate that has the ability to significantly improve patient outcomes. Leveraging our iterative discovery and screening process, we have been able to accelerate the development of this program.

• | CLR 1800 Series is a collaborative PDC program with Pierre Fabre that we entered into in December 2015 and extended in October 2017. Pierre Fabre is the third largest French pharmaceutical company with an extensive oncology research and development infrastructure. The objective of the research collaboration is to co-design a library of PDCs employing Pierre Fabre’s chemotherapeutics in combination with our proprietary cancer-targeting delivery vehicle. The newly developed PDCs may provide enhanced therapeutic indices to otherwise highly potent, non-targeted payloads through the targeted delivery to cancer cells provided by our cancer-targeting delivery vehicle. Significant progress has been achieved and the program continues to rapidly advance with a number of PDC molecules showing enhanced pharmacologic behavior over the parent compound alone.

• | CLR 1900 Series is an internally developed proprietary PDC program leveraging a novel small molecule cytotoxic compound as the payload. The payload inhibits mitosis (cell division) and targets a key pathway required to inhibit rapidly dividing cells that results in apoptosis. We believe that this program could produce a product candidate targeted to select solid tumors. Currently, the program is in early preclinical development.

• | CLR 2000 Series is a collaborative PDC program with Avicenna Oncology, or Avicenna, that we entered into in July 2017. Avicenna is a leading developer of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). The objective of the research collaboration is to design and develop a series of PDCs utilizing Avicenna’s proprietary cytotoxic payload. Although Avicenna is a leading developer of ADCs, this collaboration was sought as a means to overcome many of the challenges associated with ADCs, including those associated with the targeting of specific cell surface epitopes.

• | CLR 2100 and 2200 Series are collaborative PDC programs with Onconova Therapeutics, Inc., or Onconova, that we entered into in September 2017. Onconova is a biotechnology company specializing in the discovery and development of novel small molecule cancer therapies. The collaboration is structured such that we will design and develop a series of PDCs utilizing different small molecules that Onconova was developing as payloads with the intent to show improved targeting and specificity to the tumor. At least one of the molecules was taken into Phase 1 clinical trials previously by Onconova. We would own all new intellectual property associated with the design of the new PDCs and both companies will have the option to advance compounds.

We believe our PDC platform has potential to provide targeted delivery of a diverse range of oncologic payloads, as exemplified by the product candidates listed above, that may result in improvements upon current standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of a broad range of human cancers.
 
Technology Overview
 
Our product candidates are based on a cancer-targeting delivery platform of optimized Phospholipid Ether (PLE) analogs (phospholipid ether proprietary delivery vehicle) that interact with lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are specialized regions of a cell’s membrane phospholipid bilayer that contain high concentrations of cholesterol and sphingolipids and serve to organize cell surface and intracellular signaling molecules. As a result of enrichment of lipid rafts in cancer cells, including cancer stem cells, our product candidates provide selective targeting preferentially over normal healthy cells. The cancer-targeting PLE delivery vehicle was deliberately designed to be combined with therapeutic, diagnostic and imaging molecules. For example, iodine can be attached via a very stable covalent bond resulting in distinct products differing only with respect to the isotope of iodine they contain; CLR 131 contains radioactive I-131 and non-radioactive molecules, including cytotoxic compounds can also be attached to the delivery vehicle.
 
We are focused on exploring the creation of additional PDCs ranging from newly discovered to well-characterized chemotherapeutic payloads under its CLR hemotherapeutic PDC program. The objective of our CTX program is to develop PDC chemotherapeutics through conjugation of our delivery vehicle and non-targeted anti-cancer agents to improve therapeutic indices and expand potential indications through the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic payloads. Initial PDC product candidates include our CLR 1700, 1800, 1900, 2000, 2100 and 2200 series of conjugated compounds currently being researched independently and through partnerships. All are small-molecule, cancer-targeting chemotherapeutics in pre-clinical research. To date, multiple cancer-targeting product profiles have been generated from a single chemical core structure that is the foundation of our technology platform. We also believe that additional cytotoxic PDCs may be developed possessing enhanced therapeutic indices versus the original, non-targeted cytotoxic payload as a monotherapy.
 
Malignant tumor targeting, including targeting of cancer stem cells, has been demonstrated in vivo. Mice without intact immune systems, and inoculated with Panc-1 (pancreatic carcinoma) cells, were injected with CLR 1502, 24 or 96 hours prior to imaging. In vivo optical imaging showed pronounced accumulation of CLR 1502 in tumors versus non-target organs and tissues. Similarly, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of tumor-bearing animals (colon, glioma, triple negative breast and pancreatic tumor xenograft models) administered the imaging agent CLR 124 clearly shows selective uptake and retention by both primary tumors and metastases, including cancer stem cells. PET/CT analysis following co-injection of CLR 131 (for therapy) and CLR 124 (for imaging) revealed time-dependent tumor responses and disappearance over nine days in a cancer xenograft model. We believe that the capability of our technology to target and be selectively retained by cancer stem cells in vivo, was demonstrated by treating glioma stem cell-derived orthotopic tumor-bearing mice with another fluorescent-labeled PDC (CLR 1501), and then removing the tumor and isolating cancer stem cells, which continued to display CLR 1501 labeling even after three weeks in cell culture.

The basis for selective tumor targeting of our compounds lies in differences between the plasma membranes of cancer cells as compared to those of most normal cells. Data suggests that lipid rafts serve as portals of entry for PDCs such as CLR 131 and our multiple series of drug conjugates. The marked selectivity of our compounds for cancer cells versus non-cancer cells is due to the fact that cancer cells maintain an overabundance of lipid rafts and have stabilized these microdomains within the plasma membrane as compared to normal cells. For example, following cell entry via lipid rafts, CLR 131 is transported into the cytoplasm, where it traffics along the Golgi apparatus and is distributed to various peri-nuclear organelles (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum) but not the nucleus. The pivotal role played by lipid rafts is underscored by the fact that disruption of lipid raft architecture significantly suppresses uptake of our PDC delivery vehicle into cancer cells.
 
 Products in Development
 
CLR 131
 
CLR 131 is a small-molecule, cancer-targeting molecular radiotherapeutic PDC that we believe has the potential to be the first radiotherapeutic agent to use PLEs to target cancer cells. CLR 131 is comprised of our proprietary PLE, 18-(p-[I-131]iodophenyl) octadacyl phosphocholine, acting as a cancer-targeting delivery and retention vehicle, covalently labeled with iodine-131, a cytotoxic (cell-killing) radioisotope with a half-life of eight days that is already in common use to treat thyroid, pediatric tumors and other cancer types including non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. It is this “intracellular radiation” mechanism of cancer cell killing, coupled with delivery to a wide range of malignant tumor types that we believe provides CLR 131 with anti-cancer activity. Selective uptake and retention has been demonstrated in cancer stem cells compared with normal cells, offering the prospect of longer lasting anti-cancer activity.
 
Pre-clinical experiments in tumor models have demonstrated selective killing of cancer cells along with a safe and tolerable product profile. CLR 131’s anti-tumor/survival-prolonging activities have been demonstrated in more than a dozen models including breast, prostate, lung, brain, pancreatic, ovarian, uterine, renal, and colorectal cancers as well as, melanoma and multiple myeloma. In all but two models, a single administration of a well-tolerated dose of CLR 131 was sufficient to demonstrate efficacy. Moreover, efficacy was also seen in a model employing human uterine sarcoma cells that have known resistance to many standard chemotherapeutic drugs. CLR 131 was also tested in combination with a standard efficacious dose of gemcitabine in a pancreatic cancer model. Single doses of CLR 131 or gemcitabine given alone were equally efficacious, while the combination therapy was significantly more efficacious than either treatment alone (additive). While single doses of CLR 131 have been effective and well tolerated in multiple preclinical animal models, CLR 131 has been shown to provide a statistically significant improvement in efficacy and survival when provided in a multi-dose format and remains well tolerated. In each study, the dose of CLR 131 was ~100 µCi, which is approximately 50-fold less than the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CLR 131 determined in a six-month rat radiotoxicity study.
 
Extensive IND-enabling, Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) in vivo and in vitro pre-clinical pharmacokinetic/ distribution, toxicology and drug safety studies were successfully completed in 2007 through 2009 using non-pharmacological concentrations/doses of PLE consistent with its role as a delivery/retention vehicle in CLR 131. Tissue distribution studies supported prediction of acceptable human organ exposures and body clearance for CLR 131. Importantly, and in sharp distinction from biological products labeled with I-131, the small-molecule CLR 131 showed very minimal variation in excretion kinetics and tissue distribution among individuals within species or across a 500-fold variation in dose. Single and repeat-dose animal toxicology studies indicated very high margins of safety with our PLE delivery and retention vehicle even when administered at 80-200x over the amount required to deliver the anticipated maximum human therapy dose of CLR 131.
 
In 2009, we filed an IND with the FDA to study CLR 131 in humans. In February 2010, we completed a Phase 1 dosimetry trial with a single intravenous dose of 10 mCi/m2 CLR 131 in eight patients with relapsed or refractory advanced solid tumors. Single doses of CLR 131 were well tolerated and the reported adverse events were all considered minimal, manageable and either not dose limiting or not related to CLR 131. There were no serious adverse events reported. Analysis of total body imaging and blood and urine samples collected over 42 days following injection indicated that doses of CLR 131 expected to be therapeutically effective could be administered without harming vital organs. Two subjects (one with colorectal cancer metastasized to lung and another with prostate cancer) had tumors that were imaged with 3D nuclear scanning (SPECT/CT) on day 6 after administration of CLR 131. Uptake of CLR 131 into tumor tissue (but not adjacent normal tissue or bone marrow) was clearly demonstrated in both subjects. Confirming animal studies, pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated a prolonged half-life of radioactivity in the plasma after CLR 131 administration (approximately 200 hours) and that there was no significant variation in excretion or radiation dosimetry among subjects. The trial established an initial dose of 12.5 mCi/m2, for the Phase 1b escalating dose trial that commenced in January 2012.

The primary objective of the multicenter Phase 1b dose-escalation trial in patients with a range of advanced solid tumors was to define the MTD of CLR 131. In addition to determining the MTD, the Phase 1b trial was intended to evaluate overall tumor response (using standard RESIST 1.1 criteria) and safety. In September 2012, we announced that we had successfully completed the second cohort in this Phase 1b dose-escalation trial. Dose escalation in four cohorts subsequently occurred with refractory cancer patients receiving single doses of 25 mCi/m2, 31.25 mCi/m2 or 37.5 mCi/m2.
 
Tumor treatment with radioactive isotopes has been used as a fundamental cancer therapeutic for decades. The goals of targeted cancer therapy — selective delivery of effective doses of isotopes that destroy tumor tissue, sparing of surrounding normal tissue, and non-accumulation in vital organs such as the liver and kidneys — remain goals of new therapies as well. We believe our isotope delivery technology has the potential to achieve these goals. To date, CLR 131 has been shown in animal models to reliably and near-universally accumulate in cancer cells, including cancer stem cells, and because the therapeutic properties of iodine-131 are well known, we believe the risk of non-efficacy in human clinical trials is less than that of other cancer therapies at this stage of development, although no assurance can be given.
 
In view of CLR 131’s selective uptake and retention in a wide range of solid tumors and in cancer stem cells, its single-agent efficacy in animal models and its non-specific mechanism of cancer-killing (radiation), we are initially developing CLR 131 as a monotherapy for cancer indications with significant unmet medical need. While a number of indications were evaluated as the initial target treatment, multiple myeloma was selected principally because it is an incurable hematologic disease that is highly radiosensitive, with significant unmet medical need in the relapse or refractory clinical setting, and is designated as an orphan disease. As a result, this may provide an accelerated regulatory pathway due to CLR 131’s unique benefits such as a novel mechanism of action, ease of administration, and positive benefit/risk profile potential in various high unmet cancer populations. The IND application for multiple myeloma was accepted by the FDA in September 2014. In December 2014, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for CLR 131 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We initiated our Phase 1 Study of CLR 131 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in April 2015, and have provided periodic clinical updates. CLR 131 is being evaluated as a monotherapy and will subsequently be explored as a combination therapy with chemotherapeutic agents, immunomodulatory agents and in combination with external beam radiotherapy. CLR 131 is being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical study examining relapse refractory multiple myeloma patients as well as selected other B-cell hematological malignancies. Patients will receive a 25 mCi/m2 dose infused over approximately 30 minutes with the option of a second 25 mCi/m2 dose 75-180 days later based on physician assessment. This study is partially funded through a $2,000,000 Fast Track NCI SBIR award which was granted in July 2016.
 
In September 2017, the CLR 131 Phase 1 Cohort 4 results were announced. These results showed that a single 30 minute infusion of 31.25mCi/m2 of CLR 131 was safe and well-tolerated by the three patients in the cohort. We are also monitoring signals of efficacy, including surrogate markers M protein and FLC. IMWG defines a PR as a greater than or equal to 50 percent decrease in FLC levels (for patients in whom M protein is unmeasurable) or 50 percent decrease in M protein. Additionally, all three patients in the cohort experienced clinical benefit with one patient achieving a PR and two patients achieving stable disease. One patient experiencing stable disease attained a 44 percent reduction in M protein. The patient experiencing a partial response had an 82 percent reduction in FLC. This patient did not produce M protein, received seven prior lines of treatment including radiation, stem cell transplantation and multiple combination treatments including one with daratumumab that was not tolerated. Median OS for the study has not been reached at the time of this document and data is still being collected for the Phase 1 study and will not be considered final until the end of the study. As of November 3, 2017, patients in Cohort 1 who received a single 12.5mCi/m2 dose experienced a median OS of 26.4 months with all patients remaining alive. Median OS for Cohorts 2 and 3 also continue to mature with patients experiencing OS of 15.6 months and 10 months, respectively as of November 3, 2017. The company has initiated a Phase 2 clinical study using Cohort 3’s dose of 25.0 mCi/m2 with the option of a second 25 mCi/m2 dose 75-180 days later based on physician assessment. We may modify this dose based on safety and efficacy signals from the Phase 1 study’s ongoing Cohort 5 multi dose regimen.

On December 14, 2017, we filed an IND application with the Division of Oncology at the FDA for a proposed Phase 1 study of CLR 131 in children and adolescents with select rare and orphan designated cancers. The Phase 1 clinical trial of CLR 131 is an open-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous administration of CLR 131 in up to 30 children and adolescents with cancers including neuroblastoma, sarcomas, lymphomas (including Hodgkin's lymphoma) and malignant brain tumors. Secondary objectives of the study are to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose of CLR 131 and to determine preliminary antitumor activity (treatment response) of CLR 131 in children and adolescents. The study will be initiated with the pediatric oncologists and Nuclear Medicine/Radiology Group at UWCCC. Investigators at The University of Wisconsin have demonstrated uptake of CLR 131 and other fluorescently and isotopically tagged PDCs across a wide range of childhood solid cancer cell lines including, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, pediatric brain tumors such as high-grade gliomas, medulloblastoma and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor. In subsequent testing in mouse xenograft models of neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma, CLR 131 provided significant benefits on tumor growth rates and survival. In March 2018, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for CLR 131 for the treatment of neuroblastoma, a rare pediatric cancer. We expect to initiate the Phase 1 study during the second quarter of 2018.

Market Overview
 
Our target market is broad and represents the market for the treatment of cancer. The American Cancer Society estimated that approximately 1.69 million new cancer cases were expected to be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2016 and approximately 596,000 people were expected to die of cancer, which is the equivalent of about 1,630 per day. The global market for cancer drugs reached $107 billion in annual sales (June 2015), and could reach $150 billion by 2020, according to a report dated June 2016 by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, a unit of drug data provider IQVIA. This growth will be driven by emerging targeted therapies, which are expected to change the cancer treatment landscape (Cowen Report), and an increased use of cancer drug combination regimens.
Multiple Myeloma 
 
According to the National Cancer Institute SEER database, multiple myeloma is the second most common hematologic cancer with a U.S. incidence rate and a relapse or refractory patient population of 10,000 to 15,000. The Global Data Report for 2015 estimated the Multiple Myeloma dollar market size to be $8.9B in 2014 and is forecasted to increase to $22.4B in 2023. The increase in drug sales over this period will be mainly driven by the increasing incidence of MM in each of the seven key markets with the U.S. market remaining the largest potential market.
Chronic Lymphocytic Lymphoma and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma/Mantle Cell Lymphoma/Maginal Zone Lymphoma
 
According to the National Cancer Institute SEER data base, chronic lymphocytic lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma represents about 47,000 cases per year in the US. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma is one of the rarer forms of lymphoma with approximately 5,000 new cases per year in the U.S. Meanwhile, mantel cell and marginal zone lymphomas combined represent approximately 22,000 patients per year. The incidence rate in these diseases significantly increases with an aging population (majority of patients over the age of 60). According to a Datamonitor report from 2016, the markets for these conditions are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 5.5% in the U.S. and 7.6% in Europe until 2024 with combined sales of approximately $2B.
 Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
 
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive (fast-growing) lymphoma that can arise in lymph nodes or outside of the lymphatic system, in the gastrointestinal tract, testes, thyroid, skin, breast, bone, or brain. DLBCL is one of the most common forms of lymphoma with an incidence of approximately 57,000 patients per year (National Cancer Institute SEER data base). Datamonitor reports that the DLBCL market will expand at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2.9%.
Neuroblastoma
 
Neuroblastoma, a neoplasm of the sympathetic nervous system, is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood, accounting for approximately 7.8% of childhood cancers in the U.S. The National Cancer Institute states the incidence is about 10.54 cases per 1 million per year in children younger than 15 years and 90% are younger than 5 years at diagnosis. Over 650 new cases are diagnosed each year in North America. Approximately 50% of patients present with metastatic disease requiring systemic treatment. Clinical consequences include abdominal distension, proptosis, bone pain, pancytopenia, fever and paralysis. Although the prognosis is favorable in children under one year of age with an 86 to 95% 5-year survival, in children aged one to 14 years the 5-year survival ranges from 34 to 68%.
Pediatric High Grade Glioma
 
Pediatric high grade glioma (HGG) represent a rare and orphan pediatric tumor that has limited treatment options. HGGs are usually defined as tumors of glial origin with the most common pediatric HGGs being anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiform. The Central for Brain Tumor Registry of the United States estimate the incidence at approximately 3,600 pediatric patients per year.

Manufacturing
 
In January 2018, we initiated the planned shutdown of our radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Madison, Wisconsin. This facility was designed to provide pilot and small scale production of our lead clinical program CLR 131. In December 2017, we successfully transferred the manufacturing of CLR 131 to Centre for Probe Development and Commercialization (CPDC), a validated cGMP manufacturing organization specializing in radiopharmaceuticals, as our exclusive source to supply drug product for our ongoing research and clinical trials, including our Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies of CLR 131. We believe that CPDC and our other third party manufactures have the ability to supply large scale clinical and commercial scale material. Our third party manufacturing partners have been inspected and approved to supply clinical and commercial radiopharmaceutical material by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency.
 
CLR 131 drug product is made via a five-step synthetic scheme. The release specifications for the drug product have been established and validated. Through process improvements, we have been able to achieve a longer expiry dating for the compound extending finished product shelf-life to further facilitate ex-U.S. distribution from North America.
 
The drug substance base molecule is a dry powder produced via a six-step synthetic scheme.  The release specifications for the drug substance have been established and validated.  We have successfully executed large scale production of the drug substance via a contract manufacturing organization that has been inspected and approved by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency.  We have also demonstrated 60-month stability for the drug substance in desiccated and refrigerated forms at small scale and are replicating this at large scale. 
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We plan to pursue and evaluate all available options to develop, launch and commercialize our compounds. These options presently include, but are not limited to: entering into an agreement for a contract sales organization (CSO) or partnering arrangement with one or more biotechnology or pharmaceutical company with strong product development and commercialization expertise and distribution infrastructure in the U.S., Europe and/or Japan. While we currently do not plan to build our own commercial organization for the launch and commercialization of our compounds, we may reconsider that in the future.
 
Competition for Our Clinical-Stage Compounds
 
Currently, several classes of approved products with various mechanisms of action exist, including: immune-modulating agents, proteasome inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, corticosteroids, and traditional chemotherapeutics for the treatment of liquid and solid tumors. While a number of indications were evaluated as the initial target treatment for CLR 131, multiple myeloma and hematologic cancers were selected for initial clinical development principally because of its highly radio-sensitive nature, single or multi-dose treatment, and novel mechanism of action relative to all existing classes of approved drugs. As a result, we believe CLR 131 is a therapeutic option in the relapse or refractory setting either as a monotherapy or in combination with currently approved agents, some of which are radio-sensitizing and maintain a differential adverse event profile from that of CLR 131.
 
 Intellectual Property
 
Our core technology platform is based on research conducted at the University of Michigan in 1994, where phospholipid ether analogs were initially designed, synthesized, radiolabeled, and evaluated. This research was transferred to the University of Wisconsin - Madison between 1998 and the subsequent founding of Cellectar in 2002 to further develop and commercialize the technology. We obtained exclusive rights to the related technology patents owned by University of Michigan in 2003 and continued development of the PDC platform while obtaining ownership of numerous additional patents and patent applications (with various expiry until 2034 without extensions). We have established a broad U.S. and international intellectual property rights portfolio around our proprietary cancer-targeting PLE technology platform including CLR 131 and our PDC Programs.
 
PDC chemotherapeutic Programs
 
In November 2015, we converted our previously filed provisional patent application for Phospholipid-Ether Analogs as Cancer Targeting Drug Vehicles to non-provisional US and International (PCT) patent applications and were published by the U.S. Patent & Trade Office (USPTO) in May of 2016. These patent applications further protect composition of matter and method of use for PDCs developed with our proprietary phospholipid-ether delivery vehicle conjugated with any existing or future cytotoxic agents, including chemotherapeutics for targeted delivery to cancer cells and cancer stem cells. Additional cytotoxic PDC compounds are covered by pending patent applications directed to the composition of matter and method of use for cancer therapy provide intellectual property protection in the United States and up to 148 additional countries. These applications, if granted, offer protection extending through at least 2035 in the U.S. and key international markets.

CLR 131
 
We have taken a broad approach to creating market exclusivity for CLR 131 both within the U.S, and globally, including all major markets. This approach includes numerous patents, patent applications and regulatory filings to provide maximum market exclusivity. Our patent portfolio for CLR 131 includes all of the typical filings as well as unique methods of use, methods of manufacturing, use in combinations, use to treat cancer stem cells, novel formulations, etc. In addition, to our patents, we were granted orphan designation for CLR 131 for the treatment of multiple myeloma by the U.S. FDA in December 2014 and expect to file additional orphan designations for other rare diseases. We continue to evaluate CLR 131 in additional hematologic and solid tumor orphan designated indications. Our patents have a variety expected expiry with some potentially being extended on a country-by-country basis. In March 2018, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for CLR 131 for the treatment of neuroblastoma, a rare pediatric cancer. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 study during the second quarter of 2018.
 
We expect to continue to file patent applications and acquire licenses to other patents covering methods of use, composition of matter, formulation, method of manufacture and other patentable claims related to CLR 131 and new PDCs. These patent applications will be filed in key commercial markets worldwide. The issued patents will generally expire between 2025 and 2035, unless extended, most likely under clinical development extensions.
 
In addition to the above noted patents /applications directed to CLR 131 and our PDC pipeline portfolio, we own other patents/applications directed to different forms of phospholipid ethers, methods of use and methods of manufacturing of phospholipid ethers.
 
Separate from any patent protection and following product approval by regulatory authorities, data exclusivity may be available for various compounds for up to 10 years on a country-by-country basis (e.g., up to five years in the U.S. and up to ten years in Europe).
 
Licenses / Collaborations 
 
On September 18, 2017, we entered into an arrangement with Onconova Therapeutics, Inc. (Onconova). Under this arrangement, Onconova will provide us a selection of its proprietary compounds. We will use our proprietary technology to perform research studies on such compounds with the goal of developing new conjugates. We agree to perform the studies within 24 months. We granted Onconova an exclusive option to acquire a royalty-bearing license with respect to each conjugate developed. In the event an executed license agreement for a particular conjugate is not obtained, then Onconova’s exclusive option shall terminate with respect to such conjugate.
 
On July 9, 2017, we entered into an arrangement with Avicenna Oncology GMBH (Avicenna). Under this arrangement, Avicenna will provide us a selection of its proprietary toxins. We will use our proprietary conjugation capabilities to proceed with the conjugation in order to obtain PDCs. We will process various in vitro and in cellulo screening against such PDCs to develop new conjugates. We granted Avicenna an exclusive option to acquire an exclusive license to our intellectual property with respect to each conjugate developed. In the event the parties cannot reach agreement on the terms of a definitive agreement despite good faith negotiations, Avicenna’s exclusive option terminates as to such conjugate. Avicenna also granted to us an exclusive option to acquire an exclusive license to its intellectual property with respect to the material provided. In the event the parties do not reach agreement on the terms of a definitive agreement, our exclusive option terminates as to the material of Avicenna.

On December 14, 2015, we entered into an arrangement with Institut de Recherche Pierre Fabre (IRPF). Under this arrangement, IRPF will provide us a selection of its proprietary cytotoxics for use in an in vivo proof-of-concept study to evaluate the potential to create new drug conjugates (NDCs) in combination with our proprietary PDC platform technology. We are entitled to all intellectual property associated with the NDCs developed as part of the research collaboration. If we decide to further develop any of the NDCs for pre-clinical studies, we will enter into discussions with IRPF to acquire an option to in-license the IRPF materials. In the event that we propose to enter into a business relationship with a third party for advancement of the NDCs, we will grant IRPF a right of first refusal to enter into the same business relationship, which will be exercisable by IRPF within 60 days. In the event that we do not choose to further develop the NDCs for preclinical studies and IRPF desires to do so within four years following expiration of this arrangement the parties will enter into business discussions relating to IRPF’s use of the results of the study and certain of our proprietary technologies relating to the IRPF materials. We agreed to perform the study by June 15, 2018 and our obligation to grant a right of first refusal will continue for four years following the date on which we provide the results of the study to IRPF.
 
Research and Development
 
Our primary activity to date has been research and development. The research has historically been conducted at our facility in Madison, Wisconsin and through third party laboratories and academic universities. The clinical development has been completed primarily through contract research organizations at hospitals and academic centers. We have established a collaboration outsourcing model to leverage third party expertise, accelerate project timelines, improve productivity and limit spend and fixed costs. Our research and development expenses were approximately $9,466,000 and $4,750,000 for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Regulation
 
The production, distribution, and marketing of products employing our technology, and our development activities, are subject to extensive governmental regulation in the United States and in other countries.  In the United States, we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations of the FDA, as well as to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations, including the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including radioactive isotopes.  These laws, and similar laws outside the United States, govern the clinical and pre-clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, distribution, sale, import, export, storage, record-keeping, reporting, advertising, and promotion of drugs.  Product development and approval within this regulatory framework, if successful, will take many years and involve the expenditure of substantial resources.  Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage may result in various adverse consequences, including the delay in approving or refusal to approve a product by the FDA or other health authorities.  Violations of regulatory requirements also may result in enforcement actions, which include civil money penalties, injunctions, seizure of regulated product, and civil and criminal charges. The following paragraphs provide further information on certain legal and regulatory issues with a particular potential to affect our operations or future marketing of products employing our technology.
Research, Development, and Product Approval Process
 
The research, development, and approval process in the United States and elsewhere is intensive and rigorous and generally takes many years to complete.  The typical process required by the FDA before a therapeutic drug may be marketed in the United States includes:

• | pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests performed under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices regulations, referred to herein as GLP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | human clinical studies performed under the FDA’s Good Clinical Practices regulations, to evaluate the drug’s safety and effectiveness for its intended uses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review of whether the facility in which the drug is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued quality; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission of a marketing application to the FDA, and approval of the application by the FDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-Clinical Testing
 
During pre-clinical testing, studies are performed with respect to the chemical and physical properties of candidate formulations. These studies are subject to GLP requirements. Biological testing is typically done in animal models to demonstrate the activity of the compound against the targeted disease or condition and to assess the apparent effects of the new product candidate on various organ systems, as well as its relative therapeutic effectiveness and safety.
 
Submission of IND
 
An IND must be submitted to the FDA and become effective before studies in humans may commence. The IND must include a sufficient amount of data and other information concerning the safety and effectiveness of the compound from laboratory, animal, and human clinical testing, as well as data and information on manufacturing, product quality and stability, and proposed product labeling.
 
Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trial programs in humans generally follow a three-phase process. Typically, Phase 1 studies are conducted in small numbers of healthy volunteers or, on occasion, in patients afflicted with the target disease. Phase 1 studies are conducted to determine the metabolic and pharmacological action of the product candidate in humans and the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In Phase 2, studies are generally conducted in larger groups of patients having the target disease or condition in order to validate clinical endpoints, and to obtain preliminary data on the effectiveness of the product candidate and optimal dosing. This phase also helps determine further the safety profile of the product candidate. In Phase 3, large-scale clinical trials are generally conducted in patients having the target disease or condition to provide sufficient data for the statistical proof of effectiveness and safety of the product candidate as required by United States regulatory agencies.
 
In the case of products for certain serious or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing may be done in patients with the disease rather than in healthy volunteers. Because these patients are already afflicted with the target disease or condition, it is possible that such studies will also provide results traditionally obtained in Phase 2 studies. These studies are often referred to as “Phase 1/2” studies. However, even if patients participate in initial human testing and a Phase 1/2 study is carried out, the sponsor is still responsible for obtaining all the data usually obtained in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.
 
United States law requires that studies conducted to support approval for product marketing be “adequate and well controlled.” In general, this means that either a placebo or a product already approved for the treatment of the disease or condition under study must be used as a reference control. Studies must also be conducted in compliance with good clinical practice requirements, and informed consent must be obtained from all study subjects. The clinical trial process for a new compound can take ten years or more to complete. The FDA may prevent clinical trials from beginning or may place clinical trials on hold at any point in this process if, among other reasons, it concludes that study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Trials may also be prevented from beginning or may be terminated by institutional review boards, which must review and approve all research involving human subjects. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede, or prevent marketing authorization. Similarly, adverse events that are reported after marketing authorization can result in additional limitations being placed on a product’s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market.
 
Submission of NDA
 
Following the completion of clinical trials, the data is analyzed to determine whether the trials successfully demonstrated safety and effectiveness and whether a product approval application may be submitted. In the United States, if the product is regulated as a drug, an NDA must be submitted and approved before commercial marketing may begin. The NDA must include a substantial amount of data and other information concerning the safety and effectiveness of the compound from laboratory, animal, and human clinical testing, as well as data and information on manufacturing, product quality and stability, and proposed product labeling.

Each domestic and foreign manufacturing establishment, including any contract manufacturers we may decide to use, must be listed in the NDA and must be registered with the FDA.  The application generally will not be approved until the FDA conducts a manufacturing inspection, approves the applicable manufacturing process and determines that the facility is in compliance with cGMP requirements.
 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, the FDA receives fees for reviewing an NDA and supplements thereto, as well as annual fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products. These fees can be significant. For fiscal year 2018, the NDA review fee alone is $2,421,495, although certain limited deferral, waivers, and reductions may be available.
 
Each NDA submitted for FDA approval is usually reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 45 to 60 days following submission of the application. If deemed complete, the FDA will “file” the NDA, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. The FDA has established performance goals for the review of NDAs— six months for priority applications and ten months for standard applications. However, the FDA is not legally required to complete its review within these periods, and these performance goals may change over time.
 
Moreover, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, typically is not an actual approval but an “action letter” that describes additional work that must be done before the application can be approved. The FDA’s review of an application may involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved therapeutic uses for the product as described in the product labeling, require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval.
 
Post NDA Regulation
 
Significant legal and regulatory requirements also apply after FDA approval to market under an NDA. These include, among other things, requirements related to adverse event and other reporting, product advertising and promotion, and ongoing adherence to cGMP requirements, as well as the need to submit appropriate new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product labeling, or manufacturing process. The FDA also enforces the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act which, among other things, imposes various requirements in connection with the distribution of product samples to physicians.
 
The regulatory framework applicable to the production, distribution, marketing and/or sale of our product pipeline may change significantly from the current descriptions provided herein in the time that it may take for any of our products to reach a point at which an NDA is approved.
 
Overall research, development, and approval times depend on a number of factors, including the period of review at FDA, the number of questions posed by the FDA during review, how long it takes to respond to the FDA’s questions, the severity or life-threatening nature of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, the availability of clinical investigators and eligible patients, the rate of enrollment of patients in clinical trials, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in the clinical trials.
 
Other United States Regulatory Requirements
 
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug and biological products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, the privacy provision of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection, unfair competition, and other laws.

Our research and development, manufacturing, and administration of our drugs involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and radioactive materials, such as radioactive isotopes. Therefore, we are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the storage, use and disposal of these materials and some waste products and are required to maintain both a manufacturer’s license and a radioactive materials license with State of Wisconsin agencies.
 
Moreover, we are now, and may become subject to, additional federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and policies relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and/or the use, storage, handling, transportation, and disposal of human tissue, waste, and hazardous substances, including radioactive and toxic materials and infectious disease agents used in conjunction with our research work.
 
Foreign Regulatory Requirements
 
We, and any future collaborative partners, may be subject to widely varying foreign regulations that may be quite different from those of the FDA governing clinical trials, manufacture, product registration and approval, and pharmaceutical sales. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, we or any future collaboration partners must obtain a separate approval for a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries prior to the commencement of product marketing in these countries. In certain countries, regulatory authorities also establish pricing and reimbursement criteria. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In addition, under current United States law, there are restrictions on the export of products not approved by the FDA, depending on the country involved and the status of the product in that country.
Reimbursement and Pricing Controls

In many of the markets where we, or any future collaborative partners, would commercialize a product following regulatory approval, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls by law and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. Public and private health care payors control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Payors also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered. In particular, many public and private health care payors limit reimbursement and coverage to the uses of a drug that are either approved by the FDA or that are supported by other appropriate evidence (for example, published medical literature) and appear in a recognized drug compendium. Drug compendia are publications that summarize the available medical evidence for particular drug products and identify which uses of a drug are supported or not supported by the available evidence, whether or not such uses have been approved by the FDA. For example, in the case of Medicare coverage for physician-administered oncology drugs, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, with certain exceptions, prohibits Medicare carriers from refusing to cover unapproved uses of an FDA-approved drug if the unapproved use is supported by one or more citations in the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information, the American Medical Association Drug Evaluations, or the United States Pharmacopoeia Drug Information. Another commonly cited compendium, for example under Medicaid, is the DRUGDEX Information System.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 15 full-time employees.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
We are a party to proceedings in the ordinary course of business, however we do not anticipate that the outcome of such matters and disputes will materially affect the Company’s financial statements.
