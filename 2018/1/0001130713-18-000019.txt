ITEM 1. BUSINESS
           The following description of our business contains forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial or operating performance that involve risks and uncertainties, as set forth above under "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those set forth above in the Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements or in Section 1A under the heading "Risk Factors" or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Introduction
We are an online retailer and advancer of blockchain technology. Through our online retail business, we offer a broad range of price-competitive products, including furniture, home decor, bedding and bath, housewares, jewelry and watches, among other products. We sell our products and services through our Internet websites located at www.overstock.com, www.o.co and www.o.biz (referred to collectively as the "Website"). Although our three websites are located at different domain addresses, the technology and equipment and processes supporting the Website and the process of order fulfillment described herein are the same for all three websites.
In late 2014, we began working on initiatives to develop and advance blockchain technology, which we refer to collectively as Medici. As part of our Medici initiatives, we have formed a wholly-owned subsidiary Medici Ventures, Inc. ("Medici Ventures") and acquired a majority interest in a financial technology company and two related registered broker dealers which are owned by our majority-owned subsidiary tØ.com, Inc. ("tZERO"). Medici Ventures has also purchased interests in several blockchain technology companies. In 2015, we were the first public company to issue a private security using blockchain technology and in December 2016, as a demonstration of our technology, we issued publicly traded blockchain preferred shares of Overstock.com, Inc.
Our company, based near Salt Lake City, Utah, was founded in 1997. We launched our initial website in March 1999 and were re-incorporated in Delaware in 2002. As used herein, "Overstock," "Overstock.com,", "O.co," "we," "our" and similar terms include Overstock.com, Inc. and our majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
Industry Overview
We estimate, based on 2017 estimates from eMarketer, Home Furnishing Stores and Digital Commerce Report (2017), estimates from other publicly available reports, and our own analysis, that e-commerce sales of home goods in the United States market totaled approximately $36 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, and that they are expected to grow approximately 16% during 2018. We believe that our products are in approximately 40 million homes in the United States, or approximately one-third of all United States households. We believe that the furniture and home goods market, which is highly fragmented and has traditionally been served by brick and mortar stores, will continue transitioning to online sales, particularly as Millennial consumers (defined as those aged 20-36), who are generally comfortable shopping online, start families and move into new homes. The percentage of Millennials who bought furniture online in 2016 has been estimated at 47%, which is nearly double the next closest generational group (26% for Gen X).
Our Retail Business
Our retail business constitutes the vast majority of our business and, through December 31, 2017, generated nearly all of our net revenues. In our retail business, our goal is to provide goods to furnish and accessorize "dream homes" for our target customers—consumers who seek quality, stylish merchandise at bargain prices. At December 31, 2017, we offered 2.8 million products (6.0 million SKUs), of which over 99% were in-line products (products in active production). At December 31, 2017, we were offering three private label brands - Porch & Den, Carson Carrington and OSleep - and had more than 1,000 private label products available on our Website and intend to add additional private label brands, including home products brands, using our strength in home products to help build our private label brands. We regularly change our product assortment to meet the evolving preferences of our customers and current trends. Our products include, among others, furniture, home décor including rugs, bedding and bath, home improvement and kitchen items, and, to a lesser extent, jewelry and watches. We compete primarily based on:
8


• | Quality customer experience with an emphasis on price, value, and a wide assortment of products delivered in a personalized format with the convenience of our mobile app, and with the benefits of our award-winning customer care;


• | Proprietary technologies which we believe help us provide our customers with a quality shopping experience;


• | Logistics capabilities tailored to the furniture and home goods category and developed over our many years of e-commerce experience;


• | Long-term mutually beneficial relationships with our partners, which currently number approximately 4,100; and


• | Our Club O Loyalty Program, which we believe increases customer engagement and retention.

We have organized our retail business (sales of product offered through the Shopping Section of our Website) into two principal segments – a "direct" business and a "partner" business. For 2017, approximately 95% of our net sales were from transactions in which we fulfilled orders from manufacturers, distributors and other suppliers ("partners") selling on our website, who we generally direct to ship goods sold from their own warehouses, while we generally handle returns and customer service (our "partner" business). The remaining 5% of our net sales came from direct sales of our own inventory shipped from our warehouse, including some customer returns of partner products (our "direct" business). We provide our partners with access to a large customer base and convenient services for order fulfillment, customer service, returns handling, and other services. Our team of customer service representatives assists customers by telephone, instant online chat and e-mail. We also derive revenue from other businesses advertising products or services on our Website. Our sales are primarily to customers located in the United States. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our total net revenue.
Retail direct business
Our retail direct business includes sales made to individual consumers and businesses from our owned inventory which are fulfilled primarily from our warehouse in Salt Lake City, Utah. Our warehouses primarily fulfill orders from our retail direct business. Our warehouses generally ship between 2,000 and 5,000 packages per day and up to approximately 6,000 packages per day during peak periods.
Retail partner business
In our retail partner business, we sell merchandise from our partners primarily through our Website. We are the primary obligor for the majority of these sales transactions and we record revenue from the majority of these sales transactions on a gross basis. We generally have the ability to set pricing and source merchandise from our partners based on our discretion. Our use of the term "partner" does not mean that we have formed any legal partnerships with any of our partners. We currently have relationships with approximately 4,100 third parties who supply the vast majority of products on our Website. These partners generally perform the same fulfillment operations as our warehouses, such as order picking and shipping. We retain the right to re-direct and control the products during shipment and we handle returns and customer service related to substantially all orders placed through our Website. Revenue generated from sales on our Shopping site from both the direct and partner businesses is recorded net of returns, coupons and other discounts.
Both direct and partner revenues are seasonal, with revenues historically being the highest in the fourth quarter, which ends December 31, reflecting higher consumer holiday spending. We anticipate this will continue for the foreseeable future. To the extent possible we maintain supplier relationships, and seek new supplier relationships, for both our direct and partner businesses, and also use our working capital, to ensure a continuous allotment of product offerings for our customers. Because some (less than 1%) of our product offerings are closeout merchandise, some of our suppliers cannot supply products to us on a continuous basis.
Generally, we require authorization from credit card or other payment vendors whose services we offer to our customers (such as PayPal) or verification of receipt of payment, before we ship products to consumers or business purchasers. From time to time we grant credit to our business purchasers with normal credit terms (typically 30 days). For sales in our partner business, we generally receive payments from our customers before our payments to our suppliers are due.
Growth Strategies for Our E-Commerce Business
Our growth strategies for our e-commerce business include:
Invest in branding and marketing - We believe that some of our direct competitors spend significantly higher percentages of their revenue on marketing than we do, and that we need to increase our branding and marketing expenditures in order to increase our market share in the e-commerce home goods market and educate consumers about our current position as 
9

an online retailer offering a wide assortment of quality home goods and other products at low prices and with a high level of customer service.
Invest in distribution facilities - We want to invest in additional distribution facilities to speed shipping and improve our customer service. We offer third party logistics services to our partners. Partners participating in this program store products in one or more of our warehouses, which benefits our customers and us by providing a more predictable supply of inventory and a better customer experience, and we believe that by adding additional distribution facilities we can improve our customers' shopping experience. 
Expand investment in technology platforms - We have invested for years in building platforms that automate vendor management, product pricing, website personalization and search relevance. We want to make additional investments in automation, technology and engineering resources because we believe they can improve our customers' shopping experience.
Expand Club O rewards program to enhance customer loyalty - We believe that membership in our Club O rewards program increases customer engagement. We want to make additional investments in the program, primarily to increase member benefits and to develop additional personalization programs. We believe that these changes will increase the attractiveness of the program to customers. 
Accelerate private label strategy - We launched our private label initiative in the third quarter of 2017. Our strategy is to add private label home products brands, using our strength in home products to help build our private label brands. We have developed and are currently offering 17 private label brands and have more than 7,500 products available on our Website. We believe that private label brands can generate significant brand equity and customer loyalty.
We believe that we have operated for years with relatively limited capital compared to some of our competitors. Based on filings by public companies, we believe that many of our competitors, including Amazon, Groupon, Wayfair, and Zulily, have operated with more capital than we have. Although our 2017 results were substantially worse, from 2012 through 2016 inclusive we were profitable and had year-over-year increases in our total net revenue. With the exception of 2011, our annual GAAP operating margin from 2009 through 2016 was approximately 1%. We also believe that our customer acquisition costs are substantially lower than Wayfair's. We calculate our 2017 customer acquisition cost at $50, which is less than 70% of the "illustrative customer acquisition cost" of $73 Wayfair presented in its Q4 2017 earnings presentation. We believe that these results demonstrate that we still have the ability to operate our retail business at a profit in the future, but we also believe that in the current intensely competitive battle for market share in the home goods e-commerce market, we need to build market share and need to increase our expenditures substantially to do so.
Our ability to pursue some or all of these plans, and the extent to which we would be able to pursue some or all of them, will depend on the resources we have available, and may require significantly more capital than we currently have. See Item 7 of Part II, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"—"Liquidity and Capital Resources."
Medici Business Initiatives
Our Medici business initiatives seek to leverage the security, transparency and immutability of cryptographically protected, distributed ledgers, such as blockchains, and are focused on solving important problems, including financial transaction issues, particularly in the area of securities settlement. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Medici Ventures, conducts its primary business through its majority-owned subsidiary tZERO, which includes a financial technology company and two related registered broker dealers. Medici Ventures also holds interests in several technology companies whose focuses include commercial blockchain applications, digital currency solutions, compliance, identity, voting, and land. Our Medici business initiatives are described in more detail below under "Medici."
As described further in Item 15 of Part IV, "Financial Statements"—Note 21. Business Segments, contained in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we determined our segments based on how we manage our business, which, in our view, consists primarily of our Retail and Medici businesses. As described above, our Retail business consists of our Direct and Partner reportable segments. We use gross profit as the measure to determine our reportable segments because there is not discrete financial information available below gross profit for our Direct and Partner segments. As a result, our Medici business is not significant as compared to our Direct and Partner segments and is included in Other. Our Other segment consists of Medici.
Other Offerings
10

We offer additional products or services that may complement our primary offerings, but are not significant to our revenues. These include:

• | Worldstock Fair Trade, a store within our Website that offers handcrafted products made by artisans all over the world to help improve the lives of people in emerging economies;


• | Supplier Oasis, a single integration point through which our partners can manage their products, inventory and sales channels, and also obtain multi-channel fulfillment services through our distribution network;


• | Our international business where we offer products to customers outside the United States using third party logistics providers;


• | Cars by Overstock, a portal within our Website where our customers can search millions of new, used and certified pre-owned cars from dealers and private parties – all in one place with convenient financing and warranty options;


• | FinanceHub, a portal within our Website where our customers can shop for loans, credit cards, and insurance, and can now also access links to automated financial advisory services and discounted stock brokerage services; and


• | Pet Adoptions, a free service and portal within our Website that leverages our technology to display pets available for adoption from shelters across the United States.

Manufacturer, Supplier and Distribution Relationships
Generally, our manufacturers, distributors, or other suppliers regularly communicate to us the quantity of products that are held in reserve for us. Although our contracts grant us actionable rights to such products, our contracts do not guarantee the availability of those products for a set duration. Our manufacturer, distributors, and supplier relationships are based on historical experience with manufacturers, distributors, and other suppliers and do not obligate or entitle us to receive merchandise on a long-term or short-term basis. Our manufacturer, distributor, and supplier relationships are generally non-exclusive and we retain the right to select and change our suppliers at our discretion. In our direct business, we purchase the products from manufacturers, distributors, or other suppliers using standard purchase orders. Generally, manufacturers, distributors, and suppliers do not control the terms under which products are sold through our Website.
Products
Our Website Shopping section is organized into product and service lines or featured categories, including: Furniture, Rugs, Decor, Bed & Bath, Home Improvement, Kitchen, Outdoor, Jewelry, Watches, Women, Men, Kids & Baby, Worldstock Fair Trade, Cars by Overstock, FinanceHub, and Pet Adoptions. We frequently reorganize our departments and/or categories to better reflect our current product offerings.
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the percentages of sales contributed by similar classes of products were as follows:

Product Lines | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015
Home and garden(1) | | | | | 
Furniture | 35 | % | | 34 | % | 33 | %
Home decor | 25 | % | | 22 | % | 19 | %
Other | 21 | % | | 23 | % | 25 | %
Total home and garden | 81 | % | | 79 | % | 77 | %
Jewelry, watches, clothing and accessories | 9 | % | | 10 | % | 11 | %
Electronics and computers | 2 | % | | 3 | % | 3 | %
Other | 8 | % | | 8 | % | 9 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

(1) Home and garden includes furniture, home decor, garden and patio, kitchen and dining, bedding, home improvement, housewares and other related products.
Sales and Marketing
We use a variety of methods to target our retail consumer audience, including online campaigns, such as advertising through keywords, product listing ads, display ads, search engines, affiliate marketing programs, social coupon websites, portals, banners, e-mail, direct mail, and viral and social media campaigns. We also do brand advertising through television, radio, print ads, and event sponsorships.
11

Customer Service
We are committed to providing superior customer service. We staff our customer service department with dedicated in-house and outsourced professionals who respond to phone, instant online chat, and e-mail inquiries on products, ordering, shipping status, returns, and other areas of customer inquiry.
Technology
We use our internally developed Website and a combination of proprietary technologies and commercially available licensed technologies and solutions to support our retail operations. We use the services of multiple telecommunications companies to obtain connectivity to the Internet. Currently, our primary computer infrastructure is located in a data center in Utah. We also have other data centers which we use for backups, redundancy, development, testing, disaster recovery, and corporate systems infrastructure.
Competition
Internet retail is intensely competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. We believe that competition in this industry is based predominantly on:

• | price;


• | product quality and assortment;


• | shopping convenience;


• | website organization and load speed;


• | order processing and fulfillment;


• | order delivery time;


• | customer service;


• | website functionality on mobile devices;


• | brand recognition; and


• | brand reputation.

We compete with other online retailers, traditional retailers, and liquidation "brokers" which may specifically adopt our methods and target our customers. We currently or potentially compete with a variety of companies that can be divided into several broad categories:

• | online discount general retailers;


• | online private sale sites;


• | online specialty retailers;


• | liquidation e-tailers;


• | traditional general merchandise and specialty retailers and liquidators, many of which have a significant online presence; and


• | online retailers who are developing significant "brick and mortar" capabilities.

Many of our current and potential competitors have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. Further, any of them may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger, more established and well-financed companies, including exclusive distribution arrangements with our vendors or service suppliers that could deny us access to key products or needed services, or acquisitions of our suppliers or service providers, having the same effect. Many of them do or could devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns and devote substantially more resources to their website and systems development than we do. Many have supply chain operations that decrease product shipping times to their customers, have options for in-store product pick-up, allow in-store returns, or offer other delivery and returns options that we do not have. New technologies, the continued enhancement of existing technologies, developments in related areas such as same-day product deliveries, and the development of proprietary delivery systems increase competitive pressures on us. Based on filings by public companies, we believe that many of our competitors, including Amazon, Groupon, Wayfair, and Zulily, have operated with more capital and have more financial flexibility to invest in growth than we have. Although we believe that our 2017 customer acquisition costs of approximately $50 were less than 70% of the "illustrative customer acquisition cost" of $73 Wayfair presented in its Q4 2017 earnings presentation, other competitors of ours may have lower customer acquisition costs than we do. We believe that our results from 2012 through 2016 demonstrate that we can operate our retail business at a profit, but we also believe that in the current intensely competitive battle for market share in the home goods e-commerce market, we need to build market share and 
12

need to increase our expenditures substantially to do so. We cannot ensure that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or address increased competitive pressures (see Item 1A—"Risk Factors").
Seasonality
Our retail business is affected by seasonality because of the holiday season, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. We recognized 26.2%, 29.2%, and 29.0% of our annual revenue during the fourth quarter of 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Financial Information about Business Segments and Geographic Areas
See Item 15 of Part IV, "Financial Statements"—Note 21. Business Segments for information regarding our business segments and geographical areas.
Intellectual Property and Trade Secrets
We regard our domain names and other intellectual property as critical to our success. Included in our intellectual property is some of the financial technology we have developed as part of our Medici initiatives. We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with our employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates, and others to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including the law pertaining to trade secrets. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or trade secrets without authorization. In addition, we cannot ensure that others will not independently develop similar intellectual property. Although we have registered and are pursuing the registration of our key trademarks in the United States and some other countries, some of our trade names may not be eligible to receive registered trademark protection. In addition, effective trademark protection may not be available or we may not seek protection in every country in which we market or sell our products and services, including in the United States. Additionally, our efforts to protect our trade secrets may not succeed.
Third parties have in the past recruited and may in the future recruit our employees who have had access to our proprietary technologies, processes and operations. These recruiting efforts expose us to the risk that such employees and those hiring them will misappropriate and exploit our intellectual property and trade secrets.
Medici
Medici Overview
In late 2014, we began working on initiatives to develop and advance blockchain technologies. We pursue these initiatives through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Medici Ventures and Medici Ventures' majority-owned subsidiary tZERO. These initiatives remain in the start-up phase, and neither Medici Ventures nor tZERO has generated any significant revenues from any blockchain-based technology or application of blockchain technology. We have spent a total of approximately $107 million over the last three years in our Medici business as of the end of February 28, 2018, with most of that being spent in our majority-owned subsidiary tZERO.
A blockchain is a cryptographically secured, distributed infrastructure, or network, which may be accessed and in some cases maintained by each member of the network. Medici Ventures' strategy is to develop and advance blockchain technology to broaden access to capital, financial markets and other applications, and allow individuals to connect directly without intermediaries. Medici Ventures has a team of approximately 30 software engineers, developers and other technologists, approximately half of whom work in blockchain development and deployment, and approximately half of whom work in enterprise level software development and deployment. Medici Ventures utilizes those software engineers, developers and other technologists in tZERO's projects. Medici Ventures has also purchased relatively small strategic interests in blockchain-related businesses, particularly in businesses where Medici Ventures believes it can strategically deploy its software engineers, developers or other technologists to support those businesses as appropriate. These include PeerNova, Bitt, IdentityMind, Factom, SettleMint, Ripio, Spera, Symbiont, Voatz and Bitsy, whose focuses include commercial blockchain applications, capital markets applications, digital currency, money and banking applications, compliance, personal identity, voting, and property and land applications. Most of these interests are small, both in dollar terms and in the percentage interests that Medici Ventures owns, but Medici Ventures takes an active role in the companies to the extent its resources permit it and the respective companies desire to have Medici Ventures do so. Medici Ventures' primary business is its approximately 80% interest in tZERO, which, as described below, is a financial technology company pursuing potential financial applications for blockchain technologies. See "tZERO" below and "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Medici Business." Medici recently acquired a 50% interest in DeSoto Inc., which is a public benefit corporation formed to carry out our collaboration with economist Hernando de 
13

Soto. DeSoto intends to build systems using blockchain, social media, artificial intelligence, and mobile apps to help develop more effective records of ownership in developing countries. DeSoto does not currently have a specific plan to generate revenues or profits, and does not expect to generate revenues or profits in the foreseeable future. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Company - Our 50% subsidiary DeSoto, Inc. is a public benefit corporation."
All of the companies in which Medici Ventures holds strategic interests are startup businesses, businesses in the development stage or businesses with a short operating history. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Medici Business."
tZERO
Medici Ventures' majority-owned subsidiary tZERO is a financial technology company pursuing potential financial applications of blockchain technologies as well as non-blockchain businesses. tZERO is currently involved in, among other things, the following:

• | Non-blockchain services - SpeedRoute and PRO Securities. tZERO owns two registered broker-dealers, SpeedRoute, LLC ("SpeedRoute") and PRO Securities, L.L.C. ("PRO Securities"). SpeedRoute is an electronic, agency‑only Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA")-registered broker-dealer that provides connectivity for its customers to U.S. equity exchanges as well as off-exchange sources of liquidity such as dark pools. All of SpeedRoute's customers are registered broker-dealers. SpeedRoute does not hold, own or sell securities. PRO Securities is a FINRA-registered broker-dealer that owns and operates the PRO Securities alternative trading system (the "PRO Securities ATS"), which has filed a Form ATS with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") notifying the SEC of its activities as an alternative trading system, or ATS. An ATS is exempted from the definition of an "exchange" under Section 3(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") if it complies with Regulation ATS, which includes, among other things, the requirement to register as a broker-dealer and file a Form ATS with the SEC to provide notice of the ATS's operations. Although Section 3(a)(1) provides the definition of an exchange, Exchange Act Rule 3b-16(a) provides a functional test to assess whether a trading system meets this definition—an entity or organization that (1) brings together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers; and (2) uses established, non-discretionary methods (whether by providing a trading facility or by setting rules) under which such orders interact with each other, and the buyers and sellers entering such orders agree to the terms of the trade. A system that meets the criteria of Rule 3b-16(a), and is not excluded under Rule 3b-16(b), must register as a national securities exchange pursuant to Sections 5 and 6 of the Exchange Act or operate pursuant to an appropriate exemption. A frequently used exemption, which is relied upon by the PRO Securities ATS, is the exemption in Rule 3a1-1(a)(2) that exempts an ATS that complies with Regulation ATS. As a result, provided that it complies with the requirements of Regulation ATS, the PRO Securities ATS is not subject to the registration requirement of Section 5 of the Exchange Act. The PRO Securities ATS is a closed system available only to its broker dealer subscribers. PRO Securities does not accept orders from non-broker dealers, nor does it hold, own or sell securities.


• | Non-blockchain services - Automated Investment Advisory Services. tZERO recently purchased 65.8% of the membership units of ES Capital Advisors, LLC ("ES Capital"), a registered investment advisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. tZERO now operates the ES Capital business under the name tZERO Advisors and offers automated investment advisory services through our website's FinanceHub.


• | Non-blockchain services - StockCross Financial Services, Inc. On January 31, 2018, tZERO purchased a 24% interest in StockCross Financial Services, Inc. ("StockCross"), an affiliate of Siebert Financial Corp. ("Siebert"), and an interest in Siebert, for $12 million. As of the date of this Report, tZERO holds approximately 5.1% of Siebert's outstanding common stock. tZERO believes that StockCross, a self-clearing brokerage firm, will be an important part of a network of financial firms that tZERO intends to assemble.


• | Non-blockchain services - Agreement with Muriel Siebert & Co. On December 31, 2017, tZERO, SpeedRoute and Muriel Siebert & Co. Inc. ("Muriel Siebert") entered into an agreement pursuant to which Muriel Siebert is now advertising discounted online trading of U.S. equity securities on Overstock's website.


• | Non-blockchain services - Acquisition of Majority Interest in Verify Investor, LLC. On February 12, 2018, tZERO purchased 81.0% of Verify Investor, LLC, an accredited investor verification company, for $12.0 million in cash.


• | Non-blockchain services - Weeden Prime Services- Letter of Intent. On February 6, 2018, tZERO entered into a Letter of Intent (the "WPS LOI") with Weeden Prime Services, LLC ("WPS"), a U.S. registered broker-dealer. The WPS LOI contemplates that tZERO will acquire 51% of the outstanding membership interests of WPS for $11.0

14

million in cash with a subsequent purchase, prior to the first anniversary of the initial purchase, of an additional 30% of the aggregate membership interests of WPS for an additional $7.0 million in cash. Following the subsequent purchase, the Company will own 81% of the then-outstanding membership units of WPS. The WPS LOI contemplates that the existing members of WPS shall retain certain minority investor rights, including with respect to representation on the board of managers of WPS (proportionate to ownership) and customary drag-along and tag-along rights and anti-dilution protections. The WPS LOI also contemplates that at any time following the first anniversary of the second closing, tZERO may, with 60-days' written notice, acquire all (but not less than all) of the outstanding membership units of WPS not then owned by tZERO at fair market value. tZERO expects the transaction to close during the third quarter of 2018, subject to the execution of definitive documentation, any applicable regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.

• | Other Potential Acquisitions. tZERO continues to identify, evaluate and pursue various opportunities for strategic acquisitions or purchases of interests to add to the services and expertise it offers its customers. tZERO's management exercises substantial discretion in identifying appropriate strategic transactions and negotiating the terms of such transactions. Management's determinations are based on numerous financial, strategic and operational assumptions, and there can be no assurance that such assumptions will prove to be true. Moreover, such strategic transactions may fail to produce the benefits expected at the time of tZERO's acquisitions or purchases of interests.


• | Blockchain Services - Planned Token Trading System. In connection with Overstock’s 2016 SEC-registered offering of Blockchain Voting Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred”), tZERO developed a suite of software and technologies referred to as the tZERO Issuance and Trading Platform (the “Series A Software Platform”). The Series A Shares trade exclusively on the PRO Securities ATS, which utilizes the Series A Software Platform. tZERO currently intends to leverage its experience and expertise from developing and maintaining the Series A Software Platform to develop a trading platform that is capable of trading the tZERO Security Tokens and other tokens or coins that are determined to be securities for purposes of U.S. securities laws (the "Token Trading System"). tZERO currently does not anticipate that the Series A Software Platform will be deployed in connection with the tZERO Security Tokens in the same manner as it is currently deployed by the PRO Securities ATS. As of the date of this Report, tZERO remains in the preliminary stages of the development of such a securities Token Trading System. The Token Trading System may be developed as an additional functionality of the PRO Securities ATS, as a functionality of another U.S. alternative trading system or a U.S. exchange that tZERO operates or designates, as a functionality of a non-U.S. trading system or a non-U.S. exchange that tZERO may operate or designate, or any other format, wherever situated. The Token Trading System may never be developed, and, even if it is developed, may, for a variety of technological, legal and regulatory reasons, never become operational. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our tZERO Initiatives—tZERO has a limited operating history, which makes it hard to evaluate its ability to generate revenue through operations, and at the date of this filing, tZERO has not generated revenue from any commercially available blockchain-based application," "tZERO expects to develop a new trading platform for the tZERO Security Tokens it plans to issue in connection with its security token offering and for use by other companies that issue tokens treated as securities, but is only in the preliminary stages of development of the new trading platform," "Technology on which tZERO relies for its operations, including the technology underlying the Series A Software Platform tZERO created in 2016 for trading Overstock's Blockchain Voting Series A Preferred shares, may not function properly," and "Strategic purchases of interests and acquisitions tZERO may make may detract from the capital that tZERO could otherwise deploy to improve its business or to develop the Token Trading System."


• | Blockchain Services - Digital Locate Receipts ("DLR") software. tZERO anticipates that its first commercially available blockchain-based product will be "digital locate receipt" software (the "DLR Software"). The DLR Software is currently in customer production testing, which is being conducted by StockCross, and tZERO has not yet entered into any commercial licenses with any licensees. The DLR Software is intended to help broker-dealer licensees with stock inventory to both load and manage their inventory in order to assist short sellers of public securities in establishing that they have located available shares in the U.S. public securities market prior to effecting short sales. The DLR Software is intended to enable licensees to create a blockchain-based record of the shares that the licensee has made available for "locates" using customizable DLR Software functionality and of the daily purchases of the right to "locate" specifically identified shares for purposes of compliance with regulatory requirements. The broker-dealer licensees of DLR Software are the parties responsible for ensuring that locates issued using the DLR Software comply with all applicable regulations, and the commercial viability of the DLR Software is dependent on the ability of broker-dealer licensees to establish locates using the DLR Software as an effective means of satisfying regulatory obligations in connection with effecting short sales.

Factors—Risks Relating to Our tZERO Initiatives—tZERO has a limited operating history, which makes it hard to evaluate its ability to generate revenue through operations, and at the date of this filing, tZERO has not generated revenue from any commercially available blockchain-based application," and "—tZERO may not successfully develop, launch, market or sell its DLR Software."
Other Matters regarding tZERO
On September 27, 2017, tZERO announced a joint venture (JV) with RenGen LLC ("RenGen") and the Argon Group ("Argon") to launch an alternative trading system for the trading of tokens issued in initial coin offerings, or ICOs. Subsequent to this announcement, the parties determined to no longer pursue the development of an alternative trading system. Although the parties are no longer pursuing the development of an alternative trading system, tZERO and RenGen are in the process of re-evaluating a potential JV project, including with respect to consultancy services that the Company and RenGen may decide to provide by means of the JV project. tZERO expects that the re-envisioned JV project, if implemented, will be implemented by the Company and RenGen.
On January 16, 2018, tZERO announced its intent to provide advisory services to WENN Digital ("WENN") in connection with its previously announced KodakCoin Security Token (the "KodakCoin") offering which was initially expected to launch in the first quarter of 2018. To date, tZERO has not provided advisory services to WENN with respect to KodakCoin, and there can be no assurance that tZERO will do so. tZERO expects that the advisory services contemplated in its agreement with WENN will focus on post-ICO matters. Consequently, tZERO has not contributed to, nor reviewed, the contents of the KodakCoin Offering Memorandum or White Paper. As previously announced, the tZERO letter of intent with WENN contemplated KodakCoin being the first third-party security token to launch on tZERO’s Token Trading System, if and when it becomes operational. tZERO can provide no assurances regarding KodakCoin or the KodakCoin ICO.
On December 18, 2017, tZERO launched a $250 million offering (the "security token offering") of the right to acquire, if issued by tZERO in the future, tZERO Preferred Equity Tokens (the "tZERO Security Token") through a Simple Agreement for Future Equity ("SAFE"). The security token offering is expected to run through May 14, 2018 but may be extended or shortened. There can be no assurance as to whether, in what amount or on what terms the security token offering will be completed. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our tZERO Initiatives—Risks Related to the Ongoing Security Token Offering by tZERO," and "Risks Related to Blockchain Technology." This Annual Report on Form 10-K is not an offering document for the security token offering and does not constitute an offer of, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any of the securities being offered by tZERO in the security token offering. Any offer of any of the securities being offered by tZERO in the security token offering is made only by the confidential private placement memorandum distributed by tZERO initially dated December 18, 2017, as amended, supplemented and/or restated from time to time (the "Security Token Offering Memorandum"). The Security Token Offering Memorandum is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may purchase up to $30 million of tZERO Security Tokens in the security token offering and/or elect to receive tZERO Security Tokens in exchange for the cancellation of all or a portion of tZERO’s outstanding notes and accumulated interest owed to us; however, we have not yet made a decision regarding the foregoing transactions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or not we will elect to pursue either or both possibilities. If we participate in the security token offering, we will do so at the $10 per tZERO Security Token offering price and will be entitled to the same rights pursuant to our tZERO Security Tokens as third party holders.
To date, tZERO has focused on developing its non-blockchain and blockchain businesses and exploring opportunities for novel applications of blockchain technology. As a result of its early stage of development, tZERO has not yet generated revenue from any commercially available blockchain-based applications. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our tZERO Initiatives."
Potential Strategic Initiatives
We have engaged Guggenheim Securities, LLC to help us identify and evaluate certain strategic initiatives. We are considering a range of potential transactions, including a sale of our e-commerce business and additional equity or debt financings. Our Board of Directors continually discusses a variety of potential strategic and financial options and other changes to our business, but has not made any determination to undertake any strategic transaction, and may not do so in the foreseeable future or at all. 
A sale of our e-commerce business for cash would be subject to the approval of our stockholders in accordance with Delaware law. Subject to approval of the stockholders, if we sell our e-commerce business for cash, we may retain some or all of the after-tax proceeds of the sale for use in our blockchain initiatives. Although we currently expect to return a significant portion of the after-tax proceeds to our stockholders within 12 months following the closing of any such sale, by means of a 
16

stock repurchase program, dividend, one or more issuer tender offers to our stockholders and/or other methods, any such decisions will depend on our operating results, strategies, business prospects and general economic and market conditions existing at the time. There can be no assurance that we will engage in a stock repurchase program, dividend, issuer tender offer or otherwise distribute proceeds to stockholders by any other means in a timely manner or at all. The market price of our common stock could decrease substantially. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Current Review of Strategic Initiatives—We are exploring strategic initiatives, and decisions we may make could have material adverse effects on our business and the market price of our common stock," "If we sell our e-commerce business, our revenues will decrease substantially, we will need to develop new businesses and sources of revenue, and our business, financial results and prospects may be materially adversely affected," "The price of our common stock has increased substantially recently. If we determine not to sell our Company or our e-commerce business or make other fundamental changes to our business, the price of our common stock may decrease significantly," "If we sell our e-commerce business in order to focus on our blockchain initiatives and related efforts, risks relating to our Medici businesses, including our tZERO initiatives, that may be immaterial to us now would likely each become a material risk to us," and "If we sell our e-commerce business, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors may accelerate the vesting, in whole or in part, of some or all outstanding restricted stock units under our Equity Incentive Plan."
Legal and Regulatory Matters
From time to time, we receive claims and become subject to regulatory investigations or actions, consumer protection, employment, intellectual property, and other commercial litigation related to the conduct of our business. We also prosecute lawsuits to enforce our legal rights. Such litigation is costly and time consuming and can divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. The uncertainty of litigation increases these risks. In connection with such litigation, we may be subject to significant damages, associated costs, or equitable remedies relating to the operation of our business and the sale of products on our Website. Any such litigation may materially harm our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
These matters and other types of claims could result in legal expenses, fines, adverse judgments or settlements and increase the cost of doing business. They could also require us to change our business practices in expensive and significant ways. In addition, litigation could result in interpretations of the law that may limit our current or future business, require us to change our business practices, or otherwise increase our costs.
Additional litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any litigation, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could materially harm our business.
For further information, see (see Item 1A—"Risk Factors") and the information set forth under Item 15 of Part IV, "Financial Statements"—Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies, Legal proceedings and contingencies, contained in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation
Our main business is subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce, and other services. Existing and future laws and regulations may result in increasing expense and may impede our growth. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, information reporting requirements, the design and operation of websites, and the characteristics and quality of products and services. New state tax regulations in states where we do not now collect state and local taxes may subject us to the obligation to collect and remit state and local taxes, or subject us to additional state and local sales and income taxes, or to requirements intended to assist states with their tax collection efforts. New legislation or regulations, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and commercial online services could result in significant additional taxes on our business. These taxes or tax collection obligations could have an adverse effect on us. Further, there is a possibility that we may be subject to significant fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements. In addition, it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet, e-commerce and digital content. Laws and regulations may diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business. Certain of our services are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of consumer information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. In particular, under federal and state financial 
17

privacy laws and regulations, we must provide notice to consumers of our policies on sharing non-public information with third parties, advance notice of any changes to our policies and, with limited exceptions, we must give consumers the right to prevent sharing of their non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties. Further, the growth and demand for online commerce could result in more stringent consumer protection laws that could impose additional compliance burdens on us. These consumer protection laws could result in substantial compliance costs.
In addition, our broker dealers are subject to additional extensive regulatory requirements under federal and state laws and regulations and self-regulatory organization ("SRO") rules. Broker dealers are subject to regulation, examination and disciplinary action by the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators, as well as other governmental authorities and SROs with which they are registered or licensed or of which they are members. See Item 1A—"Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Medici Business" and "Risks Relating to Our tZERO Initiatives."
Our efforts to expand our sales outside of the U.S. expose us to additional U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to taxation, business licensing or certification requirements, advertising practices, online services, the use of cryptocurrency, the importation of specified or proscribed items, importation quotas, consumer protection, intellectual property rights, consumer and data protection, privacy, encryption, restrictions on pricing or discounts, and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties. Our interest in Bitt Inc. also may expose us to additional laws and regulations relating to money transmitters and money services businesses. See Item 1A—"Risk Factors—Our ownership interest in Bitt Inc. may expose us to additional risks."
Employees
At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1,800 full-time employees. We seasonally increase our workforce during our fourth quarter to handle increased workload in both our warehouse and customer service operations. We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relationships to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, particularly for software engineers and other technical staff.
