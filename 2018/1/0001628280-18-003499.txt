General
The Children's Place, Inc. is the largest pure-play children's specialty apparel retailer in North America. We sell apparel, accessories, footwear, and other items for children. We design, contract to manufacture, sell at retail and wholesale, and license to sell trend right, high quality merchandise at value prices, the substantial majority of which is under the proprietary “The Children's Place”, "Place", and "Baby Place" brand names. Our stores offer a friendly and convenient shopping environment. The Children's Place has differentiated departments and serves the wardrobe needs of girls and boys (sizes 4-16), toddler girls and boys (sizes 12 months-5T) and baby (sizes 0-18 months). Stores are visually merchandised by size segment. Our 
3

merchandise is also available online at www.childrensplace.com. Our customers are able to shop online and receive the same merchandise available in our physical stores, in addition to merchandise which is exclusive to our e-commerce site.
The Children's Place was founded in 1969. The Company became publicly traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in 1997. As of February 3, 2018, we operated 1,014 stores throughout North America as well as our online store. During Fiscal 2017, we opened two stores and closed 27 stores. During Fiscal 2016, we opened four stores and closed 34 stores. Also, in Fiscal 2017, we continued to expand into international markets through territorial agreements with franchisees, and, in our wholesale business, we continued to add accounts and expand categories and distribution to our customers.
 Jane Elfers, our President and Chief Executive Officer, established four key strategic initiatives:

1. | Superior Product - Product is our number one priority. We strive to ensure that we have the right product, in the right channels of distribution, at the right time. In addition to apparel, we offer a full line of accessories and footwear so busy moms can quickly and easily put together head-to-toe outfits. Our design, merchandising, sourcing, and planning teams ensure that our product is trend-right, while at the same time balancing fashion and fashion basics with more frequent, wear-now deliveries. 


2. | Business Transformation through Technology - Our business transformation through technology initiative has two key components: inventory management and digital transformation. With respect to inventory management, the implementation of our assortment planning, allocation, replenishment, order planning, and forecasting tools are delivering gross margin and inventory productivity benefits.

With respect to digital transformation, we have developed a customer database and are in the process of developing and implementing a personalized customer contact strategy. Our goal is to deliver dynamic and personalized customer content that will drive increased customer acquisition, retention and engagement, intended to result in increases in incremental sales and profitability. The transformation of our digital capabilities has continued with the deployment of our digital releases during Fiscal 2017. In conjunction with this migration, we launched Buy Online Pick Up In Store ("BOPIS") to our entire U.S. store fleet during Fiscal 2017. We also rolled out ship from store capabilities to certain stores during Fiscal 2017, as well as installed wireless networks and mobile point of sale to substantially all of our U.S. fleet as part of our connected store initiative.

3. | Growth through Alternate Channels of Distribution - We have channels of distribution, in addition to retail stores and e-commerce, including international and wholesale distribution. We continued our international expansion program during Fiscal 2017 with our franchise partners by adding 40 additional international points of distribution (stores, shop in shops, e-commerce site) bringing our total count to 190 points of distribution operating in 19 countries. In our wholesale business, our relationship with Amazon continues to develop with the expansion of our replenishment program and the launch with Amazon Canada for holiday 2017. 


4. | Fleet Optimization - We continually evaluate our store fleet as part of our fleet optimization initiative. To improve store productivity, we plan to close approximately 300 stores through fiscal 2020, which includes the 169 stores closed since the announcement of this initiative. 

Overlaying these four strategic initiatives is talent. Talent ultimately defines our success, and over the past several years we have built a best-in-class management team. We believe that this talented team is a significant competitive advantage for our Company.
Underlying these growth initiatives is a commitment to operational excellence. The Company’s commitment to operational excellence includes disciplined expense management and a focus on improving store and e-commerce operations, and combined with our finance, compliance, legal and human resources areas, forms the strong base necessary to support our long-term growth initiatives.
Segment Reporting
In accordance with FASB ASC 280--Segment Reporting, we report segment data based on geography: The Children’s Place U.S. and The Children’s Place International.  Each segment includes an e-commerce business located at www.childrensplace.com.  Included in The Children’s Place U.S. segment are our U.S. and Puerto Rico based stores and revenue from our U.S.-based wholesale business. Included in The Children's Place International segment are our Canadian-based stores, revenue from the Company's Canada wholesale business, as well as revenue from international franchisees. We measure our segment profitability based on operating income, defined as income before interest and taxes.  Net sales and direct costs are recorded by each segment.  Certain inventory procurement functions such as production and design as well as corporate overhead, including executive management, finance, real estate, human resources, legal, and information technology services are managed by The Children’s Place U.S. segment.  Expenses related to these functions, including depreciation and amortization, are allocated to The Children’s Place International segment based primarily on net sales.  The assets related to these functions are not allocated.  We periodically review these allocations and adjust them based upon changes in business 
4

circumstances.  Net sales to external customers are derived from merchandise sales and we have no major customers that account for more than 10% of our net sales. The following tables show by segment our net sales and operating income for the past three fiscal years, and total assets as of February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017:

Key Capabilities
Our objective is to deliver high quality, value priced, trend right assortments for children. Our assortment offers one stop shopping across apparel, footwear, accessories, and other items for children. Our strategies to achieve this objective are as follows:
Merchandising Strategy
Our merchandising strategy is to offer a compelling and coordinated assortment of apparel, footwear, accessories, and other items for children that encourage our customers to purchase head to toe outfitting for their children. We assort our deliveries by season and flow new product to our stores monthly.

5

High Quality and Value Pricing 
We believe that offering high quality, trend right, age appropriate merchandise under “The Children's Place”, "Place", and "Baby Place" brand names at value prices is our competitive advantage. We design and merchandise our branded apparel, footwear, and accessories to offer a compelling value to our customers.
Brand Image
We focus on strengthening our brand image and customer loyalty by:

• | Consistently offering high quality and age appropriate products and trend right fashion at value prices in a friendly and convenient shopping environment;


• | Providing coordinated outfits and accessories for our customers' lifestyle needs;


• | Creating strong merchandising and visual presentations to create a compelling in-store experience;


• | Emphasizing our great value and fashion in marketing visuals to convey a consistent brand message;


• | Leveraging our customer database to frequently communicate with our customers and tailor promotions to maximize customer satisfaction;


• | Using our MyPLACE Loyalty Rewards Program and private label credit card to drive customer engagement; and


• | Providing exclusive assortments in our e-commerce business to further expand the breadth of our offerings and brand recognition.

Low-Cost Global Sourcing 
We design, source and contract to manufacture the substantial majority of The Children's Place branded products. We believe that this is essential to assuring the consistency and quality of our merchandise, as well as our ability to deliver value to our customers. We have strong relationships with our most important vendors. Through these relationships and our extensive knowledge of low cost sourcing on a global scale, we are able to offer our customers high-quality products at value prices. We maintain a network of sourcing offices globally in order to manage our vendors efficiently and respond to changing business needs effectively. Our sourcing offices in Hong Kong, China, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Ethiopia, and contract associates in greater Africa, Cambodia, and other countries in which we source products, give us access to a wide range of vendors and allow us to work to maintain and/or reduce our merchandise costs by capitalizing on new sourcing opportunities while maintaining our product quality.
Merchandising Process
The strong collaboration between our experienced cross functional teams in design, merchandising, sourcing and planning have enabled us to build our brand. 
Design
The design team gathers information from trends, color services, research and trade shows. 
Merchandising
Each quarter, we develop seasonal merchandising strategies. 
Planning and Allocation
The planning and allocation organization works collaboratively with the merchandising, finance, and global sourcing teams to develop seasonal sales and margin plans to support our financial objectives and merchandising strategies. Further, this team plans the flow of inventory to ensure that we are adequately supporting floor sets and key promotional periods. Special attention is paid to our store types, as they differ in capacity and layout. 
Production, Quality Assurance and Social Compliance
During Fiscal 2017, we engaged independent contract vendors located primarily in greater Asia and Africa. We continue to pursue global sourcing opportunities to support our inventory needs and to seek to reduce merchandise costs. We contract for the manufacture of the substantial majority of the products we sell. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. 
During Fiscal 2017, we purchased 100% of our total merchandise directly without the aid of any third party commissioned buying agents. We source from a well-diversified network of manufacturing partners including approximately 19% of our total goods from China, approximately 17% from Bangladesh, approximately 13% from Vietnam, approximately 12% from Indonesia and approximately 11% from India. No other country accounted for 10% or more of our production. 
In addition to our quality assurance procedures, we conduct a responsible sourcing program that seeks to protect our company and enhance our brand by providing guidance in-line with industry standards to our global vendors in their efforts to 
6

provide safe and appropriate working conditions for their employees. These efforts are part of an ongoing process to encourage the continued improvement by our vendors of factory working conditions, and ultimately, the lives of their employees who make our product. This is achieved through encouraging our vendors to comply with local legal regulations, as well as industry standards, and socially responsible business practices. The components of our program are as follows:

• | Vendor Code of Conduct - By formally acknowledging and agreeing to our code of conduct, our vendors affirm their commitment to integrate compliance with local law and industry standards into their manufacturing and sourcing practices. Topics covered by these standards include child labor, involuntary or forced labor, slavery and human trafficking, coercion or harassment, discrimination, health and safety, transparency and integrity, compensation, working hours, freedom of association, environment, unauthorized subcontracting, security practices, and undue influence of independent auditors.


• | Ongoing Auditing Program - We administer a factory auditing program staffed by our internal quality assurance and responsible sourcing teams and/or professional third party auditors, who visit factory locations at least once a year on average to provide insight into general factory working conditions and other production characteristics in all factories that manufacture The Children's Place products. With this information, we can understand factories’ challenges, help the factories identify non-compliance with industry standards, and offer guidance on corrective action plans for the factories to achieve better compliance. All factories that are approved for The Children’s Place production must undergo technical capabilities and social compliance audits prior to any orders being placed and at least once annually thereafter. 


• | Corrective Action Plans - Following each social audit, a corrective action plan outlines any areas of non-compliance identified through the factory audit. Each factory is expected to develop a remediation plan and remediation timeline for any non-compliance found. Through follow-up social audits, we assess a factory’s progress in achieving its remediation plan. It is our preference to work with factories to remediate and achieve compliance rather than terminate our relationship; however, where there is serious non-compliance of critical standards, repeated non-compliance, or failure of the factories to invest in continued improvement, we reserve the right to terminate our relationship. 


• | Vendor Factory Engagement - Our responsible sourcing team provides guidance and training to vendors and factories in order to help vendors and factories improve compliance with industry standards and local laws. Our goal is to serve as a resource for vendors and factories as they develop and strengthen their capabilities to better manage the working conditions of their employees.


• | Worker Well Being Programs - The Company’s global responsible sourcing activities involve the Company’s third party factories who manufacture the Company’s merchandise. These vendors’ workforce is predominantly women who work in factories in underdeveloped countries in greater Asia and Africa. In addition to its auditing activities concerning local laws and ethical business practices, worker health and welfare, working conditions, safety, rights of association and other practices at factories, in recent times, the Company’s commitment to responsible sourcing activities has evolved beyond a compliance-based approach to a more holistic view, focusing not only on compliance, but also on worker training and education. This is accomplished through the sponsorship of workplace programs conducted by international organizations such as BSR’s HERproject, Care International, the ILO’s BetterWork program, The Center for Child Rights and Corporate Responsibility, and others. These programs promote health, nutrition, hygiene, gender equality, child care training, money management and other life-needs. 

Additionally, under our responsible sourcing program, we monitor changes in local laws and other conditions (e.g., worker safety, workers' right of association, and political and social instability) in the countries from which we source in order to identify and assess potential risks to our sourcing capabilities.
Company Stores
The following section highlights various store information for The Children's Place operated stores as of February 3, 2018.
Existing Stores
As of February 3, 2018, we operated a total of 1,014 The Children's Place stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, most of which are clustered in and around major metropolitan areas and our stores at www.childrensplace.com. In addition, our seven international partners operated 190 international points of distribution in 19 countries. We operate 622 stores located in malls, 214 in strip centers, 139 in outlet centers, and 39 in street locations. The following table sets forth the number of stores in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada as of the current and prior fiscal year end:
7


 | Number of Stores
Location | February 3, 2018 | January 28, 2017
United States | 878 | | 899
Canada | 128 | 129 
Puerto Rico | 8 | 11 
Total Stores | 1,014 | 1,039 

Store Concepts 
At The Children's Place, our store concepts consist of multiple formats ranging in size from 4,100 to 7,100 square feet, which have evolved over time in response to market trends, and are strategically placed within each market. We try to create an open and brightly lit environment for customers.  Our stores typically feature white fixtures to ensure the product is the focal point, using color to brand and create shop identifiers.
Fleet Optimization
As part of our store fleet optimization initiative, we plan to close approximately 300 stores through fiscal 2020, which includes the 169 stores closed since the announcement of this initiative. Over the past five fiscal years, we have reduced our total store square footage from 5.2 million to 4.7 million. These closures are resulting in improved profitability and operating margin accretion due to sales transfer, low cost of exit, and the elimination of the underperforming locations. In those markets where we have closed stores, we are seeing the neighboring stores along with the e-commerce business become more productive from both a Comparable Retail Sales and profitability perspective. These results further our commitment to continue to execute this optimization program while dramatically slowing down new store openings.
We continuously review the performance of our store fleet. We base our decisions to open, close or remodel stores on a variety of factors, including lease terms, landlord negotiations, market dynamics, and projected financial performance. When assessing whether to close a store, we also consider remaining lease life and current financial performance.
E-commerce Sales 
Our U.S. and International segments each include an e-commerce business located at www.childrensplace.com and digital growth remains one of our top strategic priorities. We are committed to delivering a best in class, end-to-end user experience including product assortment and website operation, fulfillment, and customer service. We are further committed to delivering these experiences to our customers when, where and how they are looking to access the brand, accounting for cross-channel behavior, growth of mobile devices, and the growing interest in our brand from international consumers. As such, we will continue to make required investments in back-end infrastructure, as well as front-end technology to deliver on this commitment. We believe that the critical investments made in areas such as e-commerce infrastructure and mobile optimization as well as additional front-end website features have improved our customers' experience.
International Franchises and Wholesale
We continued our international expansion program with our franchise partners adding 40 additional international points of distribution (stores, shop in shops, e-commerce site), during Fiscal 2017 bringing our total count to 190 points of distribution operating in 19 countries. We generate revenues from our franchisees from the sale of products and sales royalties. In our wholesale business, our relationship with Amazon continues to develop with the expansion of our replenishment program and the launch with Amazon Canada for holiday 2017. 
Store Operations
The Children's Place U.S. store operations are organized by geographical region. We have a centralized store operations function within our corporate offices who oversee our operations of both Place and Outlet stores and to whom group, zone, and regional directors report. A regional director oversees a number of district managers residing within each region. Our stores are staffed by store managers and full-time and part-time sales associates, with additional temporary associates hired to support seasonal needs. Our store managers spend a high percentage of their time on the store's selling floor providing direction, motivation, and development to store personnel. To maximize selling productivity, our teams emphasize greeting, replenishment, presentation standards, procedures, and controls. In order to motivate our store management, we offer a monthly incentive compensation plan that awards bonuses for achieving certain financial goals.

Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal influences, with heavier concentrations of sales during the back-to-school and holiday seasons. Our first fiscal quarter results are dependent upon sales during the period leading up to the Easter holiday, third fiscal quarter results are dependent upon back-to-school sales, and our fourth fiscal quarter results are dependent upon sales during the holiday season. The business is also subject to shifts due to unseasonable weather conditions. The following table shows the quarterly distribution, as a percentage of the full year, of net sales and operating income (loss):

 | First Quarter | | Second Quarter | | Third Quarter | Fourth Quarter
Quarterly net sales as a percentage of full year | | | | | | 
Fiscal 2017 | 23.3 | % | | 20.0 | % | 26.2 | % | 30.5 | %
Fiscal 2016 | 23.5 | % | | 20.8 | % | 26.5 | % | 29.2 | %
Quarterly operating income (loss) as a percentage of full year | | | | | | 
Fiscal 2017 | 26.2 | % | | 2.0 | % | 39.7 | % | 32.1 | %
Fiscal 2016 | 26.9 | % | | (2.0 | )% | 42.1 | % | 33.0 | %

For more information regarding the seasonality of our business, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Quarterly Results and Seasonality. 
Marketing
The Children's Place is a well-recognized brand, with a trend-right offering and a compelling value proposition. Our direct marketing program utilizes both on and off-line channels.
During the third quarter of Fiscal 2016, we re-launched our customer loyalty program in conjunction with our new private label credit card program. At the end of Fiscal 2017, our MyPLACE Rewards loyalty program had approximately 9.4 million members who accounted for approximately 76% of sales. Our private label credit card is issued to our customers for use exclusively at The Children's Place stores and online at www.childrensplace.com, and credit is extended to such customers through a third-party financial institution on a non-recourse basis to us. Approximately 18% of our net sales during Fiscal 2017 were transacted using our private label credit card. We promote affinity and loyalty through our marketing programs by utilizing specialized incentive programs. 
Distribution
In the United States, we own and operate a 700,000 square foot distribution center in Alabama, which supports both U.S. retail store operations and U.S. e-commerce operations. In Canada, we operate a 95,000 square foot distribution center in Ontario for our Canadian retail store operations. We also use a third-party provider to support our Canadian e-commerce operations. On occasion, we may utilize additional facilities to support seasonal warehousing needs. We also use a third-party provider of warehousing and logistics services in Malaysia to support our international franchise business.
Competition
The children's apparel, footwear, and accessories retail markets are highly competitive. Our primary competitors are specialty stores and mass merchandisers, including Target Corporation and GapKids, babyGap and Old Navy (each of which is a division of The Gap, Inc.), The Gymboree Corporation, Justice (a division of The Ascena Retail Group, Inc.), Carter's, Inc., J.C. Penney Company, Inc., Kohl's Corporation and other department stores, as well as other discount stores such as Walmart Stores, Inc. We also compete with regional retail chains, catalog companies, and e-commerce retailers. One or more of our competitors are present in substantially all of the areas in which we have stores.
Trademarks and Service Marks
“The Children's Place,” “Place,” and “Baby Place", and certain other marks have been registered as trademarks and/or service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in Canada and other foreign countries. The registration of the trademarks and the service marks may be renewed to extend the original registration period indefinitely, provided the marks are still in use. We intend to continue to use and protect our trademarks and service marks and maintain their registrations. We have also registered our trademarks in other countries where we source our products and where we have established and anticipate establishing franchising operations. We believe our trademarks and service marks have received broad recognition and are of significant value to our business.

We are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, and local laws and regulations affecting our business, including product testing and safety, consumer protection, privacy, truth-in-advertising, accessibility, customs, wage and hour laws and regulations, and zoning and occupancy ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and e-commerce sites.  We also are subject to similar international laws and regulations affecting our business. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations.

These products are imported and are subject to U.S. and Canadian customs laws, which impose tariffs, anti-dumping and countervailing duties on certain imported products, including textiles, apparel, footwear, and accessories.  We currently are not restricted by any such duties in the operation of our business.  
Employees
As of February 3, 2018, we had approximately 15,800 employees, approximately 1,700 of whom were based at our corporate offices and distribution centers.
