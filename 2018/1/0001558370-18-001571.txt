 Item 1.      Business
 Our Predecessor and Solaris
 Solaris Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in February 2017 for the purpose of completing an initial public offering of equity (the "IPO" or the "Offering") and related transactions. On May 11, 2017, in connection with the Offering, Solaris Inc. became a holding company whose sole material assets are units in Solaris LLC ("Solaris LLC Units"). Solaris Inc. became the managing member of Solaris LLC and is responsible for all operational, management and administrative decisions relating to Solaris LLC's business. Overview
 We are an independent provider of supply chain management and logistics solutions designed to drive efficiencies and reduce costs for the oil and natural gas industry. Our solutions include high-efficiency mobile and permanent infrastructure that increases proppant throughput capacity at critical junctures in the supply chain, as well as software and technology designed to optimize how proppant is dispatched across the supply chain.
 We manufacture and provide our patented mobile proppant management systems that unload, store and deliver proppant at oil and natural gas well sites. Our systems reduce our customers' cost and time to complete wells by improving the efficiency of proppant logistics, as well as enhancing well site safety. In addition, we operate an independent, transload facility in Oklahoma (the “Kingfisher Facility”) that further integrates our supply chain management and drives additional proppant logistics efficiencies for our customers. Our customers include oil and natural gas exploration and production ("E&P") companies, such as EOG Resources, Inc., Devon Energy and Apache Corporation, as well as oilfield service companies, such as ProPetro Holding Corp. Our systems are deployed in many of the most active oil and natural gas basins in the U.S., including the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford Shale, the SCOOP/STACK formations, the Haynesville Shale and the Marcellus and Utica Shales.
 Our mobile proppant management system is designed to address the challenges associated with transferring large quantities of proppant to the well site, including the cost and management of last mile logistics, which we define as the transportation of proppant from transload terminal or regional proppant mine to the well site. Today's horizontal well completion designs require between 400 and 1,000 truckloads of proppant delivered to the well site per well which creates bottlenecks in the storage, handling and delivery of proppant. Our patented systems typically provide 2.5 million pounds of vertical proppant storage capacity in a footprint that is considerably smaller than traditional or competing well site proppant storage equipment. Our systems have the ability to unload up to 24 pneumatic proppant trailers simultaneously. In addition, our non-pneumatic loading option provides additional proppant transportation flexibility for our customers, allowing them to use belly-dump trucks in addition to the industry standard pneumatic trucks to fill and maintain inventory in our proppant management systems. This non-pneumatic loading option is compatible with our existing fleet with minimal modification. Importantly, the proppant storage silos in our systems can be filled from trucks while simultaneously delivering proppant on-demand directly to the blender for hydraulic fracturing operations. Accordingly, our systems can maintain high rates of proppant delivery for extended periods of time, which helps achieve a greater number of frac stages per day, driving a reduction in our customers' costs. Our systems also reduce the amount of truck demurrage, or wait time, at the well site which can result in significant cost savings for our customers. In addition, our systems are scalable and we have experienced increased demand for our larger capacity system, which utilizes 12 silos per location. This added buffer provides our customers with additional on-site storage, which helps further alleviate logistics bottlenecks upstream of the well site.
 We have also developed a proprietary inventory management system, PropView® to enable our customers to track inventory levels in, and delivery rates from, each silo in a system on a real-time and remote basis. In December 2017 the Company completed its 

 
  5

 
acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Railtronix, LLC, a leading provider of real-time inventory management solutions for proppant mining, rail shipping and transloading operations, (“Railtronix™”). By integrating Railtronix and PropView, we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide critical supply chain data to help our customers improve the reliability of proppant supply, save time and reduce the delivered cost of proppant by monitoring key data points and performance indicators.
 Our mobile proppant management system improves well site health, safety and environmental conditions ("HS&E") by reducing respirable dust, decreasing the number of well site personnel and providing enhanced lighting. We expect the well site HS&E improvements provided by our systems, combined with increased industry focus on HS&E matters, will support continued adoption of our systems.
 We manufacture our systems in our facility in Early, Texas, which is proximate to some of the most prolific oil and natural gas producing regions in the country. We are currently manufacturing approximately eight systems per month. We have been able to achieve this manufacturing rate through selective outsourcing of certain components of our systems. Our vertically integrated manufacturing capability allows us to better control our supply chain and incorporate improvements and additional features into our systems based on our experience and customer feedback. Additionally, we believe that controlling our manufacturing process provides us cost advantages that improve our returns on capital.
 As illustrated in the following chart, we have increased our total system revenue days, defined as the combined number of days our systems earned revenues, in thirteen of the last fourteen quarters, and we have increased our system revenue days by more than 3,432% from the second quarter of 2014 to the fourth quarter of 2017, representing a 176% compound annual growth rate. The increase in total system revenue days is attributable to both an increase in the number of systems available for rental and an increase in the rate at which our systems are utilized.

     In order to further integrate our supply chain management capabilities, we are developing the Kingfisher Facility, which we believe will be the first independent, unit-train-capable transload facility in Oklahoma. The facility is in Kingfisher County, Oklahoma, which is strategic to the active SCOOP/STACK formations. We commenced initial transloading operations in January 2018 and we are receiving regular shipments of proppant for our customer. The facility is located directly on a Class I rail line owned by the Union Pacific Railroad; phase one of the 300-acre facility will include an 8,000 foot unit-train loop, 30,000 tons of high efficiency silo storage and an additional 18,000 feet of rail sidetrack. The unit-train loop and silo storage will enable the Kingfisher Facility to unload a unit train of 120 rail cars in approximately 24 hours and load more than 10,000 tons into trucks in a 24-hour period. In connection with the development of the Kingfisher Facility, we entered into a seven-year contract with minimum quarterly volume commitments with a leading exploration and production company to provide rail-to-truck and high-efficiency sand silo transload and storage services at the facility. The seven-year term commenced in January 2018. We estimate that our current contracted minimum volumes represent approximately 50% of the operational capacity of the initial phase of the facility's construction, and we are actively seeking to contract additional capacity at the facility with other customers. While the Kingfisher Facility will initially provide proppant transloading services, it will also have the capability to provide transloading services for other drilling and completion related consumables.

 Organizational Structure 
 As the sole managing member of Solaris LLC, Solaris Inc. operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Solaris LLC, and through Solaris LLC and its subsidiaries, conducts its business. As a result, Solaris Inc. consolidates the financial results of Solaris LLC and its subsidiaries and reports non-controlling interest related to the portion of Solaris LLC Units not owned by Solaris Inc., which will reduce net income (loss) attributable to Solaris Inc.'s Class A stockholders. As of December 31, 2017, Solaris Inc. owned 43% of Solaris LLC.
 In connection with the IPO, we completed a series of reorganization transactions on May 17, 2017 (the "Reorganization Transactions"), including among other things:

· | Solaris LLC's limited liability company agreement was amended and restated (as amended and restated, the "Solaris LLC Agreement") to, among other things, appoint Solaris Inc. as sole managing member, and to convert all of the membership interests in Solaris LLC held by its then-existing members (the “Original Investors”) were converted into (i) a single class of units in Solaris LLC, referred to as "Solaris LLC Units," and (ii) the right to receive the distributions of cash and shares of Solaris Inc.'s Class B common stock described below;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Solaris Inc. issued and contributed shares of its Class B common stock and all of the net proceeds of the IPO to Solaris LLC in exchange for a number of Solaris LLC Units equal to the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issued in the IPO; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Solaris LLC distributed to each Original Investor one share of Class B common stock for each Solaris LLC Unit held by such Original Investor; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Each share of Class B common stock has no economic rights but entitles its holder to one vote on all matters to be voted on by stockholders generally. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. We do not intend to list our Class B common stock on any exchange.
 Under the Solaris LLC Agreement, each Original Investor has, subject to certain limitations, the right (the “Redemption Right”) to cause Solaris LLC to acquire all or a portion of its Solaris LLC Units for, at Solaris LLC's election, (x) shares of our Class A common stock at a redemption ratio of one share of Class A common stock for each Solaris LLC Unit redeemed, subject to conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassification and other similar transactions, or (y) an equivalent amount of cash. Alternatively, upon the exercise of the Redemption Right, Solaris Inc. (instead of Solaris LLC) has the right (the "Call Right") to acquire each tendered Solaris LLC Unit directly from the exchanging Original Investor for, at Solaris Inc.'s election, (x) one share of Class A common stock or (y) an equivalent amount of cash. In addition, upon a change of control of Solaris Inc., Solaris Inc. has the right to require each holder of Solaris LLC Units (other than Solaris Inc.) to exercise its Redemption Right with respect to some or all of such unitholder's Solaris LLC Units. In connection with any redemption of Solaris LLC Units pursuant to the Redemption Right or our Call Right, the corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock will be cancelled.
 In connection with the IPO, Solaris Inc. entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”) with the Original Investors (each such person and any permitted transferee, a “TRA Holder,” and together, the “TRA Holders”). The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement commenced upon the IPO and will continue until all tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement have been utilized or expired, unless we exercise our right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement. The Tax Receivable Agreement generally provides for the payment by Solaris Inc. to each TRA Holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax and franchise tax that Solaris Inc. actually realizes (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances in periods after the IPO as a result of (i) certain increases in tax basis that occur as a result of Solaris Inc.’s acquisition (or deemed acquisition for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of all or a portion of such TRA Holder’s Solaris LLC Units in connection with the Reorganization Transactions or pursuant to the exercise of the Redemption Right or the Call Right and (ii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by Solaris Inc. as a result of, and additional tax basis arising from, any payments Solaris Inc. makes under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Solaris Inc. will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings. For additional information regarding the Tax Receivable Agreement, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock.”

 Because Solaris Inc. is a holding company with no operations of its own, Solaris Inc.’s ability to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement is dependent on the ability of Solaris LLC to make distributions to Solaris Inc. in an amount sufficient to cover its obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock—We are a holding company. Our sole material asset is our equity interest in Solaris LLC and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from Solaris LLC to pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and cover our corporate and other overhead expenses.” If we experience a change of control (as defined under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which includes certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations) or the Tax Receivable Agreement terminates early (at Solaris Inc’s election or as a result of its breach), we would be required to make a substantial, immediate lump-sum payment. 
 The following diagram indicates our simplified ownership structure as of March 6, 2018. This chart is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not represent all legal entities affiliated with us.

 Our History
 We were formed in 2014 in connection with the purchase of two proppant management systems from Loadcraft Industries, Ltd., the original manufacturer of the systems, under an exclusive marketing arrangement. In September 2014, we acquired Loadcraft Industries' proppant management system manufacturing business, including a manufacturing facility located in Early, Texas, and commenced our manufacturing operations.
 Since 2014, we have grown our fleet of proppant management systems from two systems to 91 systems, improved the capabilities of our systems and developed additional potential product offerings. Such improvements and offerings include:

· | Development of our third generation and current control system, which uses Rockwell Automation and Allen-Bradley components, has a program logic control based monitoring and operating platform, and is operated by a single technician from a single point;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Development of our proprietary PropView® system, which supplements our control system by measuring real time proppant inventory levels and delivery rates both in the well site data van and remotely through our mobile device application and website;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Development and construction of a non-pneumatic loading option which provides additional proppant transportation flexibility for our customers, allowing them to use belly-dump trucks in addition to the industry standard pneumatic trucks to fill and maintain inventory in our proppant management systems;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Design and construction of alternative conveyor belt discharge heads that we believe can be integrated with the vast majority of frac blender designs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Design and construction of custom bolt-on tarps to reduce the amount of time proppant is exposed to the open air which we believe reduces silica dust that can occur in the handling of proppant.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We currently own 91 six-silo systems across the U.S. The following table provides locations of our fleet as of March 6, 2018:

 | Number of | Percentage
Location | Systems | of Total 
Permian Basin | 54 | 60% 
Eagle Ford Shale | 22 | 24% 
SCOOP/STACK Formations | 10 | 11% 
Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale | 3 | 3% 
Haynesville Shale | 2 | 2% 
Total | 91 | 100% 

      System Design
 Our patented mobile proppant management systems typically contain six silos, two base units, one central conveyor, and one PropView system. Each of the six silos has the capacity to store up to 420,000 pounds of proppant (4,200 cubic feet). Three silos are positioned on each base and the central conveyor is positioned between the two base units. A six-silo configuration includes twenty-four unloading points. The six-silo configuration provides increased inventory capacity compared to other systems, which reduces the amount of truck demurrage, or wait time, at the well site. Our systems are scalable and we are experiencing increased customer demand for our 12-silo configuration, driven by increased proppant loadings and multi-well pad development activity.
 Our systems are powered with a single diesel generator. Hydraulic power is not required to operate our system; instead, the systems' motors are electrically driven and operate at variable speeds. Electricity is provided by one of two diesel generators that are standard on the systems while the other serves as a backup for redundancy purposes. The flow of proppant into the well site blender is controlled by the speed of the system's conveyors, which reduces the amount of proppant spillage and silica dust typically associated with labor-intensive, gate-controlled handling equipment. In addition, each silo contains a dust collection system that can handle up to 4,300 cubic feet per minute of proppant flow, which is the equivalent of unloading four pneumatic trucks simultaneously. Each system is also equipped with industrial-grade LED lighting located approximately 55 feet above the well site that provides 336,000 lumens of lighting on the well site.
 Our systems are operated using our third-generation Rockwell Automation control system and each system is equipped with our integrated PropView system. The system can be operated by a single individual, who controls the flow of proppant into the well site blender from a rugged, LED-lit Allen-Bradley suitcase touch screen. Our proprietary PropView system enables our customers to track real time proppant inventory levels in and delivery rates from each silo. Our PropView system provides critical information to our customers both directly in the well site data van and remotely through our mobile device application and website. The availability of 

 
  9

 
this data and the ability to integrate the data into existing monitoring systems enables our customers to realize efficiencies through better managing the delivery of proppant throughout the proppant supply chain and across multiple well sites.
 Additionally, our systems are highly mobile and can be easily deployed to any North American basin in response to industry activity levels. Our systems do not require specialized equipment to transport and deliver proppant to the well site. Rather, our system is compatible with standard pneumatic trailers, the industry's most abundant proppant transportation option. Our systems are also compatible with other completion equipment, including blending units and pressure pumping fleets, and can store and deliver a full range of proppants, including raw frac sand, resin coated sand and ceramic proppant. The system's compatibility with other well site equipment provides E&P operators with the flexibility to select their preferred choice of pressure pumper and proppant type and source. Our non-pneumatic loading option provides additional proppant transportation flexibility for our customers, allowing them to use belly-dump trucks in addition to pneumatic trucks to fill and maintain inventory in our proppant management systems. This non-pneumatic loading option is compatible with our existing fleet with minimal modification.
 Our systems require minimal maintenance for continued operation in the field, primarily consisting of routine replacement of fill tube components and routine maintenance of generators, all of which can be performed in the field without returning the systems to our manufacturing facility. Additionally, our systems have been configured with multiple redundancies, such as dual generators, dual central conveyor belts and twenty-four truck unloading positions, which further improve the overall reliability and efficiency of our customers' operations and enable them to complete more fracturing stages per day.
 Early, Texas Manufacturing Facility
 We manufacture our systems in our facility located in Early, Texas. Early is located in central Texas, which provides convenient access to our most active operating areas, the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford Shale, the SCOOP/STACK formations and the Haynesville Shale. We acquired our Early facility in September 2014 and have made capital improvements and improved the workflow in the plant to streamline the production process, increase output and reduce the cost of manufacturing our systems. We are currently producing approximately eight systems per month.
 Our Early facility is located on 10.8 acres of contiguous land and includes over 100,000 square feet of covered manufacturing space. We manufacture new systems at the facility and, when appropriate, make repairs to and upgrade our systems. We cut, roll, weld and assemble our systems, including our custom transportation trailers, at the facility. Machinery and capabilities at our Early facility include steel rolling machines, overhead cranes, trunnions, positioners, I-beam assemblies, plasma tables and a paint booth.
 We made capital improvements at our Early facility in late 2015 and early 2016 to streamline our manufacturing processes, including adding welding trunnions, production fixtures and overhead crane capacity that reduce the amount of time required to weld and assemble our systems. In addition, we reconfigured the layout of the plant to improve the manufacturing process flow. We believe our Early facility is a competitive advantage that provides us with a greater ability to control manufacturing costs, as well as additional supply chain and quality security and research and development capabilities.
 We have historically outsourced the manufacturing of some of our system components in order to increase our manufacturing rate to meet market demand. All systems are completed and inspected in our Early facility to ensure quality control before entering the field.
 Kingfisher Facility
 In July 2017, we entered into a seven-year contract with an exploration and production company to provide proppant transloading service at a facility to be constructed and operated by Solaris in Kingfisher, Oklahoma. We commenced initial transloading operations at the facility in January 2018. The Kingfisher Facility is located central to the active SCOOP/STACK plays and we believe it is the first independent, unit-train capable, high speed transload facility in Oklahoma. We are initially focused on proppant transloading services, but the Kingfisher Facility will also have capacity to provide transloading services for other drilling and completion related consumables.
 The Kingfisher Facility is located on a 300-acre parcel of land, directly on a Class I rail line owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. Solaris secured a 30-year land lease with the State of Oklahoma and commenced construction activity in August 2017. The facility is designed to service multiple large volume customers with dedicated storage and unit train loop tracks, including an initial 8,000 foot 

 
  10

 
unit-train loop and 18,000 feet of rail sidetrack. Initial storage will include 30,000 tons of vertical storage in six silos with individual capacity of 5,000 tons per silo. The facility also services manifest trains and provides direct rail-to-truck transloading. The estimated capital investment for the first phase of development to complete core infrastructure and fully support the customer contract totals at the Kingfisher Facility is approximately $40.0 million. This investment includes capital expenditures related to engineering and site preparation, as well as rail and silo construction that is scheduled to be fully completed by August 2018.
 Railtronix™
 In December 2017, we acquired the assets of Railtronix, a leading provider of real-time inventory management solutions for proppant mining, rail shipping and transloading operations. As the U.S. oil and gas industry continues to transition towards manufacturing-style development of resource plays, operators and service companies are looking for new ways to digitalize their supply chains. By integrating Railtronix and PropView, we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide critical supply chain data to help our customers improve the reliability of proppant supply, save time and reduce the delivered cost of proppant by monitoring key data points and performance indicators.
 Upon closing the acquisition, we integrated Railtronix into our business. We recently completed the first phase of data integration between the Railtronix and PropView inventory management systems in connection with commencing transloading operations at our Kingfisher Facility. We can now provide our customers with full visibility across their supply chain from the mine to well site.
 Raw Materials and Key Suppliers
 The primary raw materials used in the manufacturing of our systems are steel in the form of plate, bar stock and square and round tubing. We purchase steel and most other raw materials and components on the open market and rely on third parties for providing certain materials, including axles, motors and generators. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of raw materials and finished goods to meet our manufacturing requirements because these items are generally available from multiple sources. However, prices for such raw materials and finished goods can fluctuate widely and represent a significant portion of the cost of manufacturing our systems. Accordingly, our cost of revenue and capital costs may be affected by changes in the market price or disruptions in the availability of raw materials, components and sourced finished goods, and significant increases in the cost of steel or other raw materials and motors, generators and other components could adversely affect our revenues or increase our costs. Steel represents 10% to 15%, purchased parts represent 40% to 50% and labor and indirect manufacturing costs represent 30% to 50% of the total cost of manufacturing a typical system.
 We purchase the materials used in the manufacturing of our systems from various suppliers. We also work with select third-party manufacturers to fabricate certain components to supplement our internal production capacity during periods of peak demand. During the year ended December 31, 2017, two suppliers, RNB Controls, Inc. and Delta Steel Inc., as well as two third party manufacturers, Heil Trailer International Co. and BWJ Metalworks LLC, accounted for approximately 27% of our total spending. During the year ended December 31, 2016, three suppliers including RNB Controls, Inc., Stewart & Stevenson, LLC and Delta Steel Inc., accounted for approximately 26% of our total purchases.
 We have historically relied on a limited number of suppliers for certain critical components used in our systems, including motors for our conveyor belts. To date, we have generally been able to obtain these motors and other equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our manufacturing operations on a timely basis. While we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these materials and/or products by one of our suppliers, including with respect to the supplier of our motors, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption or shortage in the supply of certain of our materials. In addition, certain materials for which we do not currently have long-term supply agreements could experience shortages and significant price increases in the future. As a result, we may be unable to mitigate any future supply shortages and our results of operations, prospects and financial condition could be adversely affected.
 Our Customers and Contracts
 Our core customers are major E&P and oilfield service companies. We generally execute master service agreements ("MSAs") with our customers. Generally, the MSAs govern the relationship with our customers with specific work performed under individual work orders, and we typically provide our services on a monthly basis. For the year ended December 31, 2017, EOG Resources, Inc., ProPetro Holding Corp., Schlumberger Technology Corporation and Devon Energy Corporation accounted for approximately 23%, 

 
  11

 
15%, 13% and 11%, respectively, of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2016, EOG Resources, Inc. and ProPetro Holding Corp. accounted for approximately 39% and 11%, respectively, of our total revenues. Approximately 90% of our current fleet is deployed to customers who are renting multiple systems.
 On July 27, 2017, we entered into a sand storage and transload agreement with a third-party customer pursuant to which we have agreed to provide certain rail-to-truck and high-efficiency sand silo transload and storage services for the customer's proppant volumes at the Kingfisher Facility. The agreement became effective in January 2018 when we received initial proppant volumes. The term runs seven years therefrom, with renewal options for additional six-month terms thereafter. Under the agreement, the customer pays us a base fee per ton that is transloaded at the facility and the customer has committed to minimum quarterly service and storage volume obligations. In the event of any quarterly shortfall, the customer is subject to a shortfall fee. The contracted minimum annual revenue upon completion of the initial phase of construction, which is expected by August 2018, is approximately $13.0 million, and we are actively seeking to contract additional capacity at the facility with other customers.
 Competition
 The oil and gas services industry is highly competitive. Please read "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We face significant competition that may impede our ability to gain market share or cause us to lose market share." There are numerous large and small services companies in all regions of the United States with whom we compete. We face competition from proppant producers and proppant transporters who also offer solutions for unloading, storing and delivering proppant at well sites and also from competitors who, like us, are exclusively focused on developing more efficient proppant logistic solutions. Our main competitors include U.S. Silica, Proppant Express Solutions, LLC, FB Industries Inc., National Oilwell Varco, Inc., Charlton Hill, Sandcan, CIG Logistics, OmniTRAX, Inc. and Hi- Crush Partners LP.
 Although some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, we believe that we are well positioned competitively due to our existing market share, patented protected technology, unique service offerings, low cost of operation and strong operational track record. The most important factors on which we compete are product and service quality, performance, reliability and price. Demand for our systems and services and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our systems and services, are closely linked to proppant consumption patterns for the completion of oil and natural gas wells in North America. These consumption patterns are influenced by numerous factors, including the price for hydrocarbons, the drilling rig count and hydraulic fracturing activity, including the number of stages completed and the amount of proppant used per stage. Further, these consumption patterns are also influenced by the location, quality, price and availability of proppant, including raw frac sand, resin-coated sand and ceramic proppant.
 Segment Information and Geographic Area
 Operating segments are defined under GAAP as components of an enterprise that (i) engage in activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (ii) for which separate operational financial information is available and is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker for the purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance.
 Solaris Inc.’s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer. Solaris Inc. and the Chief Executive Officer view the Solaris LLC’s operations and manage its business as one operating segment.  All of our operations are conducted in one geographic area of the United States. For additional information, see Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 
 Seasonality
 We provide our proppant management systems and services to E&P companies operating in oil and natural gas producing basins where severe weather conditions may curtail drilling activities and, as a result, impact our revenues generated from those regions. For a discussion of the impact of weather on our operations, please read “Risk Factors— Seasonal weather conditions and natural disasters could severely disrupt normal operations and harm our business.” Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
 We are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety, the discharge of materials into the environment and protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations may 

 
  12

 
expose us to significant costs and liabilities and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations in particular areas. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations, and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. Private parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. In addition, the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, these laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly pollution control equipment, the occurrence of delays in the permitting or performance of projects, or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.
 Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that future events, such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions adverse to our operations will not cause us to incur material costs or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating costs.
 The following is a discussion of material environmental and occupational health and safety laws, as amended from time to time, that relate to our operations or those of our customers that could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Air Emissions
 Our and our customers' operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and analogous state laws, which restrict the emission of air pollutants and impose permitting, monitoring and reporting requirements on various sources. These laws and regulations may require us or our customers to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we and our customers may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues.  For example, in October 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards. The EPA published a final rule in November 2017 that issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone for approximately 85% of the U.S. counties as either “attainment/unclassifiable” or “unclassifiable” and is expected to issue non-attainment designations for the remaining areas of the U.S. not addressed under the November 2017 final rule in the first half of 2018.  States are also expected to implement more stringent permitting and pollution control requirements as a result of this new final rule, which could apply to our or our customers’ operations.  Additionally, in June 2016, the EPA published a final rule under the CAA that established criteria for aggregating multiple oil and gas sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes. This rule could cause small facilities (such as tank batteries and compressor stations), on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements, which in turn could result in operational delays or require us to install costly pollution control equipment. Compliance with these or other new regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our or our customers’ equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our or our customers’ capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact our business.
 Changing and increasingly stricter requirements, future non-compliance, or failure to maintain necessary permits or other authorizations could require us to incur substantial costs or suspend or terminate our operations.
 Climate Change
 Climate change continues to attract considerable public, governmental and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”). These efforts have included consideration by states or groupings of states of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources.
 At the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. However, the EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment 

 
  13

 
and has adopted regulations that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources for conventional pollutants, which reviews could require securing Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) permits at covered facilities emitting GHGs and meeting "best available control technology" standards for those GHG emissions. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified production, processing, transmission and storage facilities in the United States on an annual basis. In October 2015, the EPA amended and expanded the GHG reporting requirements to all segments of the oil and natural gas industry, including gathering, compression and boosting facilities as well as blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines, and in January 2016, the EPA proposed additional revisions to leak detection methodology to align the reporting rules with the new source performance standards.
 Federal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations. In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing NSPS Subpart OOOOa that requires certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and volatile organic compound (“VOC”) emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards will expand the previously issued NSPS Subpart OOOO requirements issued in 2012 by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices, requiring additional controls for pneumatic controllers and pumps as well as compressors, and imposing leak detection and repair requirements for natural gas compressor and booster stations.  However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of the June 2016 standards for two years and re-evaluate the entirety of the 2016 standards but the EPA has not yet published a final rule and, as a result, the June 2016 rule remains in effect but future implementation of the 2016 standards is uncertain at this time.  In another example, the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final rule in November 2016 that imposes requirements to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaking on federal and Indian lands.  However, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule that temporarily suspends or delays certain requirements contained in the November 2016 final rule until January 17, 2019.  The suspension of the November 2016 final rule is being challenged in court.  These rules, should they remain in effect, and any other new methane emission standards imposed on the oil and gas sector could result in increased costs to our or our customers’ operations as well as result in delays or curtailment in such operations, which costs, delays or curtailment could adversely affect our business.
 Additionally, in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that prepared an agreement requiring member countries to review and "represent a progression" in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. This "Paris Agreement" was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016; however, this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, but rather includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. The adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation or regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise restrict emissions of GHGs could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, demand for our systems and services, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce, which could reduce demand for our systems and services. 
 Recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream activities. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and natural gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time. Finally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and the financial condition and operations of our customers.

 Water Discharges
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act ("CWA"), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into state waters or waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure ("SPCC") requirements require containment to mitigate or prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an oil overflow, rupture or leak, and the development and maintenance of SPCC plans at our or our customers' facilities. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) pursuant to an appropriately issued permit.
 In June 2015, the EPA and the Corps published a final rule attempting to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States including wetlands, but legal challenges to this rule followed.  The 2015 rule was stayed nationwide to determine whether federal district or appellate courts had jurisdiction to hear cases in the matter and, in January 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.  The EPA and Corps proposed a rulemaking in June 2017 to repeal the June 2015 rule, announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, and published a final rule on February 6, 2018 specifying that the contested June 2015 rule would not take effect until February 6, 2020.  Recently, on January 22, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision finding that jurisdiction resides with the federal district courts; consequently, while implementation of the 2015 rule currently remains stayed, the previously-filed district court cases will be allowed to proceed.  As a result of these recent developments, future implementation of the June 2015 rule is uncertain at this time but to the extent any rule expands the scope of the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, drilling programs could incur increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas.
 Hydraulic Fracturing
 We manufacture and operate proprietary equipment and provide well site services that enhance the delivery of proppant used by hydraulic fracturing operators in the oil and natural gas industry. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and increasingly common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and oil from low permeability hydrocarbon bearing subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, proppants, and chemical additives under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock, increase permeability and stimulate production. Although we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, our customers use our systems and services in their hydraulic fracturing activities. 
 While the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered regulation of hydraulic fracturing, no such legislation has been adopted. Rather, hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions and similar agencies. However, several federal agencies have conducted investigations or asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that "water cycle" activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.  Additionally, the EPA asserted regulatory authority in 2014 pursuant to the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act's ("SDWA") Underground Injection Control ("UIC") program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities. The EPA also published final rules under the CAA in 2012 and in June 2016 governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing. Also, in June 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and, in May 2014, published an ANPR regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. The BLM published a final rule in March 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands.  However, in June 2016, a Wyoming federal judge struck down this final rule, finding that the BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule, the BLM appealed the decision to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in July 2016, the appellate court issued a ruling in September 2017 to vacate the Wyoming trial court decision and dismiss the lawsuit challenging the 2015 rule in response to the BLM’s issuance of a proposed rulemaking to rescind the 2015 rule and, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the March 2015 rule. In January 2018, litigation challenging the BLM’s rescission of the 2015 rule was brought in federal court.

 Also, some states have adopted, and other states have, from time to time, considered adopting regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. States could elect to prohibit high-volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York. Aside from state laws, local land use restrictions may restrict drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. Municipalities may adopt local ordinances attempting to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether or, at a minimum, allow such fracturing processes within their jurisdictions to proceed but regulating the time, place and manner of those processes.
 The adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal or state levels imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting or delaying, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells, increase our customers' costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could adversely impact demand for our systems and services. In addition, heightened political, regulatory, and public scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing practices could expose us or our customers to increased legal and regulatory proceedings, which could be time-consuming, costly, or result in substantial legal liability or significant reputational harm. We could be directly affected by adverse litigation involving us, or indirectly affected if the cost of compliance limits the ability of our customers to operate. Such costs and scrutiny could directly or indirectly, through reduced demand for our systems and services, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Non-Hazardous and Hazardous Wastes
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable state laws control the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. These laws and regulations govern the generation, storage, treatment, transfer and disposal of wastes that we generate. In the course of our operations, we generate waste that are regulated as non-hazardous wastes and hazardous wastes, obligating us to comply with applicable standards relating to the management and disposal of such wastes. In addition, drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA's less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in response to the filing of a lawsuit by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency's failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, the EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in December 2016. Under the decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and as waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our customers' costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes and a corresponding decrease in their drilling operations, which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Site Remediation
 The CERCLA and comparable state laws impose strict, joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner and operator of a disposal site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of remediating the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances. Endangered Species
 The Endangered Species Act ("ESA") restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. As a result of one or more settlements entered into by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, that agency is required to consider listing numerous species as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act by specified timelines. Current ESA listings and the designation of previously unprotected species as 

 
  16

 
threatened or endangered in areas where we or our customers operate could cause us or our customers to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures and could result in delays or limitations in our or our customers' performance of operations, which could adversely affect or reduce demand for our systems and services.
 Worker Health and Safety
 We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. State and Local Regulation
 We are subject to a variety of state and local environmental review and permitting requirements. Some states, including Texas where our manufacturing facility is located, have state laws similar to major federal environmental laws and thus our operations are also subject to state requirements that may be more stringent than those imposed under federal law. Our operations may require state-law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project's impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations, and scenic areas. Texas has specific permitting and review processes for oilfield service operations, and state agencies may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. The development of new sites and our existing operations also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building, and transportation requirements. Intellectual Property
 We continuously seek to innovate our manufacturing processes and product and service offerings to enhance our operations and deliver increased value to our customers. Our engineering team is focused on continuing to improve our manufacturing operations, expanding the capabilities of our systems and enhance our service offerings. We believe our investment in research and development will result in the development of complementary products and services, which will provide a competitive advantage as our customers focus on extracting oil and natural gas in the most economical and efficient ways possible.
 We seek patent and trademark protections for our technology when we deem it prudent, and we aggressively pursue protection of these rights. We believe our patents, trademarks, and other protections for our proprietary technologies are adequate for the conduct of our business and that no single patent or trademark is critical to our business. In addition, we rely to a great extent on the technical expertise and know-how of our personnel to maintain our competitive position, and we take commercially reasonable measures to protect trade secrets and other confidential and/or proprietary information relating to the technologies we develop.
 As of December 31, 2017, we had two issued patents in the United States and corollary patents issued in Canada and Mexico; two utility patent applications in the United States and Canada and one provisional patent applications in the United States, each relating to our systems and services and other technologies. Our issued patents expire, if all of the maintenance fees are paid, between 2032 and 2033. We cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. In addition, any patents may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them.
 Properties and Insurance
 Our principal properties are described above under the captions "—Early, Texas Manufacturing Facility" and "—Kingfisher Facility." We believe that our properties and facility are adequate for our operations and are maintained in a good state of repair in the ordinary course of our business. However, our assets may be affected by natural or man-made disasters and other external events that may disrupt our manufacturing operations. These hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations. In addition, our operations 

 
  17

 
are subject to, and exposed to, employee/employer liabilities and risks such as wrongful termination, discrimination, labor organizing, retaliation claims and general human resource related matters.
 Further, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in our industry. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our systems are deployed or services are performed may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.
 We believe that our insurance coverage is customary for the industry in which we operate and adequate for our business. To address the hazards inherent in our business, we maintain insurance coverage that includes first-party physical damage coverage, third-party general liability insurance, auto liability, employer's liability, environmental liability and other coverage, although coverage for environmental related losses is subject to certain limitations. However, we do not have insurance against all foreseeable risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs. The occurrence of an event not fully insured against or the failure of an insurer to meet its insurance obligations could result in substantial losses. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. Insurance may not be available to cover any or all of the risks to which we are subject, or, even if available, it may be inadequate, or insurance premiums or other costs could rise significantly in the future so as to make such insurance prohibitively expensive.
 We customarily enter into MSAs with our customers that delineate our customer's and our respective indemnification obligations with respect to the systems we deploy. Generally, under our MSAs, we assume responsibility for pollution, contamination and other damage originating from any negligence or willful misconduct in our operation of the system. However, we generally do not assume responsibility for any other pollution or contamination that may occur during operations, including any pollution or contamination which may result from the actual proppant used on the well site, including pollution or contamination that may result from seepage or any other uncontrolled disbursement of proppant. While we have not received claims relating to pollution or contamination in the deployment of our systems, if we are ultimately deemed responsible, our obligations may include the control, removal and clean-up of any pollution or contamination. In such cases, we may be exposed to additional liability if we are negligent or commit willful acts causing the pollution or contamination. We routinely attempt to require and are sometime successful in requiring our customers to agree to indemnify us against claims arising from their employees' personal injury or death to the extent that their employees are injured by operating our systems, unless the loss is a result of our negligence or willful misconduct. Similarly, we generally agree to indemnify our customers for liabilities arising from personal injury to or death of any of our employees, unless resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of our customer. The same principals often apply to mutual indemnification for loss or destruction of customer-owned property or equipment, except such indemnification is not limited by negligence or misconduct. Losses due to catastrophic events are generally the responsibility of the customer. However, despite this general allocation of risk, we may be unsuccessful in enforcing contractual terms, incur an unforeseen liability that is not addressed by the scope of the contractual provisions or be required to enter into an MSA with terms that vary from our standard allocations of risk, as described above. Consequently, we may incur substantial losses above our insurance coverage that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
 Legal Proceedings
 Due to the nature of our business, we may become, from time to time, involved in routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims related to our business activities. In the opinion of our management, there are no pending litigation, disputes or claims against us which, if decided adversely, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we employed 266 people pursuant to an Administrative Services Agreement. For additional information, please see note “14. Related Party Transactions” under Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good. Available Information
