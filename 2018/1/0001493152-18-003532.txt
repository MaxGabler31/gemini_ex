Overview
 
Ritter Pharmaceuticals, Inc. develops novel therapeutic products that modulate the gut microbiome to treat gastrointestinal diseases. We are advancing gut health research by exploring the gut microbiota and translating the functionality of prebiotic-based therapeutics into applications intended to have a meaningful impact on a patient’s health.
 
Our first novel microbiome modulator, RP-G28, an orally administered, high purity galacto-oligosaccharide, is currently under development for the treatment of lactose intolerance. RP-G28 is designed to selectively stimulate the growth of lactose-metabolizing bacteria in the colon, thereby effectively adapting the gut microbiome to assist in digesting lactose (the sugar found in milk) that reaches the large intestine. RP-G28 has the potential to become the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the treatment of lactose intolerance. RP-G28 has been studied in Phase 2a and Phase 2b clinical trials and is a first-in-class compound.
 
On March 28, 2017, we announced top-line results from our Phase 2b clinical trial of RP-G28 for the treatment of lactose intolerance. The Phase 2b trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm, multi-center study evaluating safety, efficacy and tolerability of two dosing regimens of RP-G28 in patients with lactose intolerance. Enrollment was initiated in March 2016 and the last patient completed dosing in October 2016. The study aimed to evaluate a patient’s ability to consume dairy foods post-treatment with improved tolerance and reduced digestive symptoms. A total of 368 subjects were randomized in the trial with 18 clinical sites participating throughout the United States. Patients underwent a screening period and a 30-day treatment period, followed by a 30-day post-treatment “real world” observation of milk and dairy product consumption period.
 
A subset of subjects enrolled into a 12-month extension study to evaluate long-term durability of treatment. The extension study also evaluated each participant’s microbiome, expanding knowledge of the effects that RP-G28 may have on adapting the gut microbiota in a beneficial manner. We completed this study in the fourth quarter of 2017.
 
We held a Type C meeting with the FDA’s Division of Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products in March 2017, prior to the unblinding of our Phase 2b data, to discuss our development plans and Phase 2b clinical trial. The focus of the meeting was to obtain the FDA’s feedback on our Phase 2b clinical trial, including our statistical analysis plan (“SAP”), prior to unblinding any data.
 
We held an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA’s Division of Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products in August 2017. The purpose of the meeting was to obtain the FDA’s feedback on our Phase 3 program. We reached general consensus with the FDA on certain elements of our current Phase 3 program and have received clear guidance and recommendations on many necessary components of our Phase 3 program; including the clinical, non-clinical, and chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) requirements needed to support an NDA submission.
 
We have incorporated much of this guidance into our Phase 3 program. Our current Phase 3 clinical program will consist of two confirmatory clinical trials of similar trial design as our Phase 2b clinical trial and will include additional components that may allow for claims for durability of effect. These additional trials may be run in parallel. We anticipate that the first Phase 3 clinical trial will begin in the second quarter of 2018.
 
The Gut Microbiome
 
The human gut is a relatively under-explored ecosystem but provides a great opportunity for using dietary intervention strategies to reduce the impact of gastrointestinal disease. The human body carries about 100 trillion microorganisms in the intestines, which is 10 times greater than the number of cells in the human body. This microbial population is responsible for a number of beneficial activities such as fermentation, strengthening the immune system, preventing growth of pathogenic bacteria, providing nutrients, and providing hormones. The increasing knowledge of how these microbial populations impact human health provides opportunities for novel therapies to treat an assortment of diseases such as neurological disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer, allergies, autism and depression.
Lactose Intolerance
 
Lactose intolerance is a common condition attributed to the absence or insufficient levels of the enzyme lactase, which is needed to properly digest lactose, a complex sugar found in milk and milk-containing foods.

-

 

Studies have suggested that lactose intolerance is a widespread condition affecting over one billion people worldwide and over 40 million people in the United States (or 15% of the U.S. population), with an estimated nine million of those individuals demonstrating moderate to severe symptoms.
 
Current annual spending on over-the-counter lactose intolerance aids in the United States has been estimated at approximately $2.45 billion. However, these options are limited and there is no long-term treatment available.
 
Unlike many common gastrointestinal conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel diseases, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or dyspepsia (among many others), lactose intolerance symptoms can be completely abated by avoiding dietary lactose. In this regard, lactose intolerance is an avoidance condition, similar to celiac sprue, food intolerances, or various environmental allergies. However, dairy avoidance may lead to inadequate calcium and vitamin D intake, which can predispose individuals to decreased bone accrual, osteoporosis, hypertension, rickets, osteomalacia, and possibly certain cancers. Although supplements and calcium-rich foods are available, several studies have shown that lactose intolerance patients had an average calcium intake of only 300-388 mg/day, significantly less than the 1000-1200 mg/day adult dietary recommended levels. The 2010 National Institutes of Health conference on lactose intolerance highlighted the long-term consequences of dairy avoidance demonstrating both the importance of treating the condition and the need to find improved solutions for patients.
 
Diagnosis
 
Lactose intolerance is often diagnosed by evaluating an individual’s clinical history, which reveals a relationship between lactose ingestion and onset of symptoms. Hydrogen breath tests may also be utilized to diagnose lactose malabsorption and a milk challenge may be used to differentiate between lactose malabsorption and lactose intolerance. Further tests can be conducted to rule out other digestive diseases or conditions, including: stool examination to document the presence of a parasite, blood tests to determine the presence of celiac disease, and intestinal biopsies to determine mucosal problems leading to malabsorption, such as inflammatory bowel disease or ulcerative colitis.
Health Consequences
 
Substantial evidence indicates that lactose intolerance is a major factor in limiting calcium intake in the diet of individuals who are lactose intolerant. Studies suggest that these individuals avoid milk and dairy products, resulting in an inadequate intake of calcium and significant nutritional and health risks.
 
At the 2010 National Institute of Health (“NIH”) Consensus Development Conference: Lactose Intolerance and Health, the NIH highlighted numerous health risks tied to lactose intolerance such as: osteoporosis; hypertension; and low bone density. There is substantial evidence indicating that lactose intolerance is a major factor in limiting calcium and nutrient intake in the diet of people who are lactose intolerant. Adequate calcium intake is essential to reducing the risks of osteoporosis and hypertension. In addition, chronic calcium depletion has been linked to increased arterial blood pressure, thereby establishing a relationship between hypertension and low calcium intake. Moreover, there is evidence of a correlation between calcium intake and both colon and breast cancer.
 
Decreased Calcium Intake Increases the Risk for Hypertension
 
Numerous published reports show that chronic calcium depletion may lead to increased arterial blood pressure. Many additional papers have corroborated this relationship between hypertension and a low calcium intake.
 
A growing body of evidence indicates that a nutritionally sound diet rich in fruits, vegetables and a generous component of low-fat dairy foods (sometimes referred to as the DASH diet) is optimal for reducing the risk of hypertension. Several reports have confirmed this finding in middle-aged and elderly women. Further, it appears that the DASH diet with generous low-fat dairy is associated with low prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Studies have suggested that the levels of dairy foods (three to four servings per day) required to achieve these effects are well above current U.S. averages and even further above those of lactose intolerant individuals who are avoiding dairy due to symptoms.
 
Our History
 
We were formed as a Nevada limited liability company on March 29, 2004 under the name Ritter Natural Sciences, LLC. Our first prototype, Lactagen™, was an alternative lactose intolerance treatment method. In 2004, clinical testing was conducted, which included a 61-subject double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial. The results were published in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in May 2005 and demonstrated Lactagen™ to be an effective and safe product for reducing symptoms for nearly 80% of the clinical participants who were on Lactagen™.

In 2008, we expanded our focus by developing a prescription drug development program. We initiated the program by developing RP-G28, a second generation edition of Lactagen™. We believe that RP-G28 enables us to state stronger claims, garner more medical community support and reach a wider market in the effort to treat lactose intolerance.
 
To help fund the development of RP-G28, we were awarded a grant from the United States government’s Health Care Bill program, the Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project, in 2008. The grant program provides support for innovative projects that are determined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to have reasonable potential to result in new therapies that treat areas of unmet medical need and/or prevent, detect or treat chronic or acute diseases and conditions.
 
On September 16, 2008, we converted into a Delaware corporation under the name Ritter Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
 
We completed our initial public offering in June 2015. Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the trading symbol “RTTR”.
 
Our Leading Product Candidate — RP-G28
 
Overview
 
RP-G28 is a novel highly purified GOS, which is synthesized enzymatically. The product is being developed for the treatment of lactose intolerance. The therapeutic is taken orally (a powder solution mixed in water) for 30 consecutive days. The proposed mechanism of action of RP-G28 is to increase the intestinal growth and colonization of bacteria that can metabolize lactose to compensate for a patient’s intrinsic inability to digest lactose. Once colonization of bacteria has occurred, it is hypothesized that patients will continue to tolerate lactose as long as they maintain their microflora balance. RP-G28 has the potential to become the first FDA-approved drug for the reduction of symptoms associated with lactose intolerance.
 
Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS)
 
RP-G28 is a >95% purified GOS product derived from a commercially available GOS food ingredient, which is designated as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA. GOS refers to a group of compounds containing β-linkages of 1 to 6 galactose units with a single glucose on the terminal end and are found at low levels in human milk. GOS is purified to a pharmaceutical grade by minimizing residual glucose, lactose, galactose and other impurities. Further processing includes ultra-filtration, nano-filtration, decolorization, deionization, and concentration to yield GOS 95 syrup, which is the starting material for RP-G28.
 
GOS products resist hydrolysis by salivary and intestinal enzymes because of the configuration of their glycosidic bonds and reach the colon virtually intact. The undigested GOS enhances the growth of beneficial, lactose metabolizing, colonic bacteria that already exist in the subject’s digestive track, including multiple species and strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Once colonies of these bacteria have increased, continued lactose exposure should maintain tolerability of lactose without further exposure to RP-G28.
 
While formal nonclinical studies evaluating the safety of RP-G28 have not been performed, other commercially available GOS products have been evaluated in acute and repeat-dose general toxicology studies, reproductive toxicology studies, juvenile toxicology studies, genetic toxicology studies, and in long-term safety studies.
 
Clinical studies of GOS products were reviewed as part of the safety evaluation to support the Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for RP-G28. These include studies in adults (including pregnant women and geriatrics), children, infants and newborns (preterm and full term). The safety of GOS products in humans has been evaluated in 1316 adults at doses of 2.5 to 20 g/day for up to 12 months, and in 1125 children > 1 year of age at doses of 2.0 to 12 g/day for up to 1 year. Overall, no safety concerns attributable to the consumption of GOS were reported. Where side effects were observed, they were typically mild and limited to increased flatulence, abdominal discomfort, and changes in stool consistency and frequency; however, effects were not consistently observed in all studies. Similar observations of increased flatulence have been reported following the consumption fructo-oligosaccharies (FOS) (15 g/day) over a 7-day period (Alles, 1996), and this symptom represents a localized effect that is expected in association with the consumption of indigestible fiber in large quantities. There were no reports of events in other System Organ Class (SOC) suggestive of systemic toxicity.
 
The significance of a higher purity GOS, namely RP-G28, was highlighted in a 2010 study by Klaenhammer. The in vitro study concluded that RP-G28 promoted growth of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, but did not promote multiple strains of E. coli. In contrast, lower purity GOS stimulated both bifidobacteria as well as the strains of E. coli evaluated. (As seen below in Figure 1, NCK 430 (e. coli) grew in the presence of low purity GOS (GOS 2). Alternatively, the higher purity GOS (RP-G28/GOS 1) did not promote the growth of E. coli.).

Mechanism of Action
 
RP-G28 is understood to resist hydrolysis by salivary and intestinal enzymes due to the configuration of their glycosidic bonds and consequently reach the colon virtually intact. The product is then broken down intracellularly by galactosidases, and eventually β-galactosidase hydrolyzes the terminal lactose. This leads to selective alterations in the composition and activity of the microbiome in which RP-G28 enhances the growth of lactose-metabolizing bacteria, including species of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli (30). In our Phase 2a Clinical Trial (G28-001), shifts in the fecal microbiome in 82% of participants on treatment and increases in relative abundance of both Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli were reported. RP-G28 had a bifidogenic effect in 90% of responders, which included species Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolenscentis, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium breve, and Bifidobacterium dentium (30). The understood mechanism of action is that by increasing lactose-metabolizing bacteria, less undigested lactose is fermented, and thus reduces gas production and related LI symptoms. Data correlating bacterial taxa and symptom metadata support this proposed hypothesis. In the G28-001 study, microbiome changes correlated with clinical outcomes of improved lactose tolerance in which an increase in Bifidobacterium was associated with decreased pain and cramping outcomes.
Our Market Opportunity
 
Unmet Medical Needs
 
Lactose intolerance is a challenging condition to manage. According to a market research study conducted by Objective Insights in April 2012, approximately 60% of lactose intolerant sufferers reported experiencing symptoms daily, or bi-weekly. Not only can symptoms be painful and embarrassing, they can also dramatically affect one’s quality of life, social activities, and health. Currently there are few reliable, or effective, treatments available that provide consistent or satisfactory relief.
 
Currently, there is no approved prescription treatment for lactose intolerance. Most persons with lactose intolerance avoid ingestion of milk and dairy products while others substitute non-lactose-containing foods in their diet. However, complete avoidance of lactose-containing foods is difficult to achieve (especially for those with moderate to severe symptoms) and can lead to significant long-term morbidity (i.e., dietary deficiencies of calcium and vitamin D).

Treatment Options
 
Doctors generally recommend the following treatments for the management of lactose intolerance: (1) dairy avoidance; (2) lactase supplements; (3) probiotics/dietary supplements; and (4) dairy substitutes/lactose free products. Despite educating their patients on all viable treatment options, physicians tend to advise their patients to refrain from consuming any dairy products whatsoever. However, in a 2008 survey conducted by Engage Health, 47% of lactose intolerance sufferers reported that this method was not effective (largely due to hidden dairy products in ingredients), and only 30% of lactose intolerance sufferers reported lactase supplements as being effective in managing their lactose intolerance. Further, while probiotics/dietary supplements have been demonstrated to aid and support one’s digestive system, helping break down general foods consumed, they don’t directly help with lactose intolerance. The 2008 survey by Engage Health suggests that the majority of lactose intolerance patients are dissatisfied with current treatment options.
Patients Unsatisfied with Current Management Options
 

Growing Awareness
 
Lactose intolerance is a condition that continues to expand as society advances and evolves. It has been estimated that gastroenterologists see approximately 15 new patients with lactose intolerance each month. Education and awareness have increased, and the American diet has greatly changed over the past decade to include more dairy-based goods. As the populace is growing older, the prevalence of lactose intolerance is increasing because more people tend to develop lactose intolerance later in life. Increased education and diagnosis is making more people aware of their allergies and digestive conditions. Physicians may compound the growth of lactose intolerance prevalence and its associated disorders by recommending individuals to avoid dairy products, a practice which in and of itself may increase severity of the intolerance.

In order to achieve our objective of developing safe and effective applications to treat conditions associated with microbiome disfunctions, our near-term and long-term strategies include the following:

● | proceed into Phase 3 clinical trials of RP-G28 for the treatment of lactose intolerance; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | complete remaining Phase 3 activities needed for an NDA; 
● | develop and commercialize RP-G28 either by ourselves or in collaboration with others throughout the world; 
● | explore the use of RP-G28 for additional potential therapeutic indications and orphan indications; 
● | establish ourselves as a leader in developing therapeutics that modulates the human gut microbiome; 
● | continue to develop a robust and defensible patent portfolio, including those we own and those we plan to in-license in the future; and 
● | continue to optimize our product development and manufacturing capabilities both internally and externally through outside manufacturers. 

Clinical and Regulatory 
 
IND Application/Phase 1
 
The IND for RP-G28 was activated initially to support a Phase 2a safety, tolerability and efficacy study in lactose intolerant patients. Standard Phase 1 single and repeat dose safety and tolerability studies in healthy volunteers were not needed because other GOS products that contain similar GOS constituents are generally regarded as safe (GRAS) and therefore supported the safety of RP-G28 in humans.

-

 

In 2018, a Phase 1 study will be conducted to understand the potential for systemic absorption of RP-G28 and any impact the presence of food may have on the pharmacokinetic profile of RP-G28. A Phase 1 QT/QTc study may be needed if there is measurable systemic exposure of RP-G28. Phase 1 systemic drug-drug-interaction (DDI) studies may also be needed if there is measurable systemic exposure of RP-G28, or if DDI potential within the gut is suggested by the results of in vitro DDI studies.
 
Phase 2a Study
 
We completed a double-blinded, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial to validate the efficacy, safety and tolerance of RP-G28 compared to a placebo. We evaluated RP-G28 in 62 patients with lactose intolerance over a treatment period of 35 consecutive days. Post-treatment, subjects reintroduced dairy into their diets and were followed for an additional 30 days to evaluate lactose digestion, as measured by hydrogen production and symptom improvements. In order to confirm lactose intolerance and study participation, subjects underwent a 25-gram lactose challenge in the clinic. Lactose intolerance symptoms and hydrogen production via hydrogen breath test were assessed for six hours post-lactose dose. Eligible subjects were required to demonstrate a minimum symptom score and a “positive” hydrogen breath test in order to be eligible for randomization. A “positive” breath test was defined as a hydrogen gas elevation of 20 parts per million (ppm) at two time-points within the six hours following a lactose-loading dose. The primary endpoints included tracking patients’ gastrointestinal symptoms via a patient-reported symptom assessment instrument (a Likert Scale, measuring individual symptoms of flatulence, bloating, cramping, abdominal pain and diarrhea, on a scale of 0 (none) to 10 (worst)) at baseline, day 36 and day 66; as well as the measurement of hydrogen gas levels in their breath following a 25-gram lactose challenge.
 
Positive trends were seen when the entire per protocol study population was analyzed, including some statistically significant subgroup analysis, suggesting a therapeutically positive effect. Although there were few primary and secondary efficacy endpoints with statistically significant results, the combined data suggest that RP-G28 is exerting a positive therapeutic effect
 
Key findings of the Phase 2a clinical trial included:
 

● | RP-G28 was well tolerated with no significant study-drug related adverse effects. The benign adverse event safety profile of RP-G28 with dose levels up to 15 gm/day observed in this study is consistent with the known safety of GOS products administered up to 20 gm/day reported in literature. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Subjects in the RP-G28 group reported a reduction in total symptoms after treatment. Reported symptom improvement continued 30 days post-treatment. Improvement in symptoms was assessed in the study using several different measures, including a pain Likert scale and a patient global assessment. Subjects receiving RP-G28 had greater improvement in most of their symptoms (cramps, bloating and gas) following lactose challenge compared to placebo, but the differences were not statistically significant given the small cohort size. However, a clinically meaningful reduction in abdominal pain was seen in subjects receiving RP-G28 compared to placebo. 
● | An analysis of “responders” for abdominal pain (defined as subjects who reported a score of zero in abdominal pain severity following a lactose challenge at Day 36/Hour 6 and Day 66/Hour 6) was performed. In the 55 subjects who noted abdominal pain following the baseline (Day 0) lactose challenge, 50% of RP-G28-treated subjects reported no abdominal pain compared to 17% of the placebo-treated subjects. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0190). See Figure 2 below. 
● | An analysis of “responders” for abdominal pain (defined as subjects who reported a greater than 50% decrease in abdominal pain severity following lactose challenge between Day 0/Hour 6 and Day 36/Hour 6) was performed. In the 55 subjects who noted abdominal pain following the baseline (Day 0) lactose challenge, 72.2% of RP-G28-treated subjects reported a >50% reduction in abdominal pain severity compared to 42.1% of the placebo-treated subjects. This difference was also statistically significant (p=0.0288). 
● | Six times as many patients in the treatment group versus the placebo group described themselves as lactose tolerant in the global assessment and did not report symptoms associated with lactose intolerance on Day 66. After completion of study treatment at Day 36, subjects were encouraged to re-introduce dairy foods into their diet. Thirty days later (Day 66), subjects were asked to provide an assessment of their symptom status, i.e., whether they considered themselves still lactose intolerant compared with subjects receiving placebo (Yes/No). As seen below in Figure 2 below, in the 58 subjects providing responses, a significantly larger percentage of subjects receiving RP-G28 (30%) considered themselves no longer lactose intolerant compared with subjects receiving placebo (5.6%); this result was statistically significant (p=0.0389). 
● | Shifts in the fecal microbiome in 82% of participants on treatment (31) and increases in relative abundance of both Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli were reported. Pre-treatment, three distinct clusters were identified, while post-treatment (Day 66) two distinct clusters were identified, demonstrating a clear shift in certain species represented before and after treatment. RP-G28 had a bifidogenic effect in 90% of responders, which included species Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolenscentis, Bifidobacterium catenulatum, Bifidobacterium breve, and Bifidobacterium dentium (30).

The clinical results of our Phase 2a study were published in Nutrition Journal in a manuscript entitled “Improving lactose digestion and symptoms of lactose intolerance with a novel galacto-oligosaccharide (RP-G28): a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.” The microbiome results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science in a manuscript entitled “Impact of short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides on the gut microbiome of lactose-intolerant individuals.”
 
Type C Meeting with the FDA
 
We held a Type C meeting with the FDA’s Division of Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products on February 2013. The purpose of the meeting was to obtain the FDA’s feedback on the planned Phase 2 program and Phase 3 programs, inform the FDA of our ongoing development plans, gain feedback on relevant clinical trial design and end points related to patient meaningful benefits, and to inform the FDA of the status of our product characterization.
 
Phase 2b Clinical Trial
 
Enrollment in our Phase 2b clinical trial of RP-G28 was initiated in March 2016 and completed in August 2016. The final patient completed dosing and all monitoring visits in October 2016.
 
The Phase 2b trial was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial of 368 subjects designed to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of two dosing regimens of RP-G28 in subjects with moderate to severe lactose intolerance. Two hundred and forty-seven (247) subjects received RP-G28 while 121 subjects received placebo. Twenty-four (24) subjects were discontinued prematurely from the study and 344 (91.2%) completed the study.
 
The trial assessed patients with lactose intolerance symptoms as measured on a Likert scale after a lactose challenge. Entry criteria in the Phase 2b trial included a hydrogen breath test to validate lactase deficiency. The Phase 2b trial design included a screening period, a 30-day course treatment period, and a 30-day post-treatment “real world” observation period during which subjects were followed while lactose containing food products were re-introduced into their diets. The study was designed to escalate the dose beyond the 15 gm/day dose level evaluated in the Phase 2a study. Study subjects abstained from lactose containing food products and were then randomized evenly (1:1:1) to receive one of two doses of RP-G28 or placebo for 30 days.
 
The primary endpoint for the Phase 2b clinical trial was a LI symptom composite score response at day 31. A response was based on change from baseline (Day -7, visit 1) to end of treatment period at day 31 (visit 5), combined average of four maximum symptom scores taken over 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours for each symptom (abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, and gas movement) after a lactose challenge test. A response was defined as a 4-point or greater decrease from baseline or a composite score of zero at day 31. The Phase 2b trial further required the collection of fecal samples from patients enrolled to evaluate the baseline and changes to the patient’s microbiome that correlate to symptom reduction and lactose tolerance.

We held a Type C meeting with the FDA in March 2017, to discuss our development plans and Phase 2b clinical trial. The focus of the meeting was to obtain the FDA’s feedback on our Phase 2b clinical trial, including our SAP, prior to unblinding any data.
 
In order to gather long-term data on subjects exposed to RP-G28, we also offered enrollment in an observational 12-month extension study, G28-003XA, to subjects who completed the Phase 2b protocol. As RP-G28 is expected to provide extended relief from lactose intolerance symptoms beyond the initial 30-day treatment phase, this extension study for the Phase 2b program will assess the long-term treatment effect. The study is also evaluating each participant’s microbiome, expanding our knowledge of the effects that RP-G28 may have on adapting the gut microbiota in a beneficial manner. We completed this study in the fourth quarter of 2017. We intend for the results from this study to support durability of treatment and guide the need to evaluate an additional 30-day course of treatment in subjects who experience the return of lactose intolerance symptoms after an initial course of RP-G28.
 
Topline results of the Phase 2b clinical trial were announced in March 2017. Due to inconsistent data results from one study site, the data from this site was excluded from the primary analysis population (Efficacy Subset mITT). After excluding the data from the one anomalous study site, results showed a clinically meaningful benefit to subjects in the reduction of lactose intolerance symptoms across a variety of outcome measures. The majority of analyses showed positive outcome measures and the robustness of the data point to a clear drug effect. Treatment patients not only reported meaningful reduced symptoms, but also 30-days after taking the treatment, patients reported adequate relief from lactose intolerance symptoms and satisfaction with the results of the treatment, with RP-G28 preventing or treating their lactose intolerance symptoms. Greater milk and dairy product consumption was also reported by patients.
 
Because the efficacy data from one study site was found to be significantly different from that of the other study sites, the data from this site was excluded from the primary analysis population (Efficacy Subset mITT. n=296). It was decided that, in addition to the efficacy analysis for the mITT Population, the Efficacy Subset mITT population would be used to perform all efficacy analyses.
 
In the Efficacy Subset mITT Analysis group, the primary endpoint met statistical significance, (39.7% of the pooled dosing group compared to 25.8% of the placebo group responded (p=0.0159)). Because the primary analysis was statistically significant, the primary endpoint comparison between the high dose group and the placebo group was then tested and also met statistical significance (38.1% of the high dose group, compared to 25.8% of the placebo group responded (p=0.0294)). The comparison between the low dose group and the placebo group further met statistical significance (p=0.0434).
 
In the entire study population (mITT population), including patients from the excluded study site, taking at least one dose of drug (n=368), the comparison between the pooled treatment groups and the placebo group narrowly missed statistical significance (p=0.0618), (40.1% of the pooled treatment group responded compared to 31.4% of the placebo group). Both low dose and high dose group arms demonstrated a higher proportion of responders than the placebo group.
 
In the Efficacy Subset Per-protocol population (Efficacy Subset PP), significant and meaningful symptom improvement was consistently seen across key individual lactose intolerance symptoms by patients reporting a ≥4-point improvement from baseline (proportion of subjects on treatment that reported improvement in severity of each symptom). Of the treatment patients, 56.1% reported significant improvement in abdominal pain compared to 45.7% in the placebo group (p=0.1046). Of the treatment patients, 54.5% reported statistically significant improvement in cramping compared to 40.2% in the placebo group (p=0.0257). Of the treatment patients, 55% reported statistically significant improvement in bloating compared to 41.3% in the placebo group (p=0.0282). Finally, 44.4% of treatment patients reported significant improvement in gas movement compared to 32.6% in the placebo group (p=0.0599). See Figure 4 below.

In a more stringent assessment, many patients reported that they experienced complete elimination of lactose intolerance symptoms, scoring a 0 out of 10 on a Likert pain scale post-treatment (Efficacy Subset PP). Of the treatment patients, 37.0% reported complete elimination of abdominal pain compared to 21.7% in the placebo group (p=0.0144). Of the treatment patients, 34.9% reported complete elimination of cramping compared to 16.3% in the placebo group (p=0.0020). Of the treatment patients, 29.6% reported complete elimination of bloating compared to 16.3% in the placebo group (p=0.015). Of the treatment patients, 16.4% reported complete elimination of gas movement compared to 2.2% in the placebo group (p=0.0005). Symptoms of abdominal pain, cramping, bloating and gas movement were then combined into a composite endpoint representing the key symptoms of lactose intolerance. Of the treatment patients, 13% experienced complete elimination of lactose intolerance symptoms compared to 2% in the placebo group (p=0.004). See Figure 5 below.
Figure 5
 

Observing global patient-reported assessments (Efficacy Subset PP) on multiple aspects of their symptom severity and treatment benefit experience 30 days after treatment and adding dairy and milk products back into their diets, 81.9% of treatment patients reported no or mild lactose intolerance symptoms compared to 63.7% in the placebo group (p=0.0013). Of the treatment patients, 66.3% reported being very or extremely satisfied with RP-G28 preventing or treating their lactose intolerance symptoms compared to 51.6% in the placebo group (p=0.0302). Of the treatment patients, 83.2% reported adequate relief from lactose intolerance symptoms compared to 72.5% in the placebo group (p=0.042). Of the treatment patients, 39.7% reported much or very much improvement in their lactose intolerance symptoms compared to 25.3% in the placebo group (p=0.0343). See Figure 6 below.

Further, a real-world milk intake assessment was conducted on treatment and placebo group patients (Efficacy Subset PP). At baseline, lactose intolerance patients reported consuming 0.2 cups/d of milk. After RP-G28, treatment patients increased their milk consumption to 1.5 cups/d of milk, consuming 1.3 cups/d more of milk (p=0.0084), 39% more milk consumed per day than placebo patients reported consuming (See Figure 7 below). We believe this is significant because the USDA recommends healthy individuals to consume 1.5 cups/d of milk. Overall, 62% of treatment patients consumed ≥1 cups/d of milk after being treated (p=0.0095). The increase in milk consumption is meaningful for dairy avoiders because it reflects increased lactose tolerance and may lead to more dietary calcium intake post-treatment as milk contains a higher percentage of one’s daily intake of calcium.

No serious adverse events related to treatment were reported and the number of adverse events reported was similar between treatment and placebo groups.

End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA
 
We held an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA’s Division of Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products in August 2017. The purpose of the meeting was to obtain the FDA’s feedback on our planned Phase 3 program. We reached general consensus with the FDA on certain elements of our Phase 3 program and have received clear guidance and recommendations on many necessary components of our Phase 3 program; including the clinical, non-clinical, and chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) requirements needed to support an NDA. We have incorporated much of this guidance into our Phase 3 program.
 
Elements of our Phase 3 program are expected to include the following:
 

● | Trial Design: Will consist of two confirmatory clinical trials of similar trial design and size as our Phase 2b clinical trial and will include additional components that may allow for claims for durability of effect. The trials may be run in parallel. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Protocol design: Will consist of multi-center, randomized, doubled-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials designed to determine the efficacy, safety and durability of RP-G28 compared to a placebo in subjects with lactose intolerance. The protocol designs include screening to determine lactose intolerance, 30-day course of treatment, and 6-months of post-treatment observation. 
● | Primary endpoint: Will evaluate a patient’s LI symptom composite score (including abdominal pain, cramping, bloating and gas) after a lactose challenge, comparing the mean difference between baseline symptom score to 30-days post-treatment symptom score. 
● | Secondary endpoints: Will evaluate LI signs and symptoms and global assessment outcomes to evaluate and assess a patient’s continued meaningful treatment benefit. 

 
In preparation for Phase 3, we have had regular communications with the FDA and have received feedback from the FDA on the Phase 3 protocols, the statistical analysis plan (SAP), non-clinical matters, chemistry and controls, as well as other items.
 
The FDA has provided the following recommendations with respect to our revised Phase 3 protocols, SAP and other items (all of which we intend to implement):
 

● | The FDA has confirmed that two confirmatory pivotal studies are required for a NDA filing. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A primary endpoint was agreed upon. 
● | The FDA has indicated that retreatment must be evaluated in order to provide proper labeling information for clinicians regarding when they should prescribe retreatment, and that we must continue the evaluation of efficacy and safety. 
● | The FDA has indicated that a pharmacokinetic (PK) study, in a fed and fasted state, must be conducted to confirm no to low systemic exposure in order to permit a broad definition of renal classes allowed for inclusion criteria. 

Nonclinical Safety Plans
 
Given the established safety profile of GOS in humans and the lack of significant safety concerns with RP-G28 administered to subjects in the Phase 2a and Phase 2b clinical trials, it was agreed with the FDA (August 2017 End-of-Phase 2 meeting) that no additional non-clinical safety studies are required to support continued evaluation of RP-G28 in the Phase 3 program. The FDA also agreed that no rat fertility, rat peri-post natal reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity or, importantly, rodent carcinogenicity studies are needed for the NDA submission.
 
As recommended by the FDA, we will continue to evaluate females of child-bearing potential who are willing to use appropriate contraception throughout the duration of any study. ICH-compliant embryo-fetal development toxicology studies of RP-G28 in the rat and rabbit will be conducted to support the NDA submission. Additional general toxicity studies may also need to be conducted for the NDA submission.
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We have an exclusive worldwide agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) to manufacture a higher purity form of GOS (referred to as “Improved GOS”) with Ricerche Sperimentali Montaleor (“RSM”) in connection with our clinical and nonclinical studies we will need to conduct prior to receiving regulatory approval for RPG-28. RSM has also agreed that it will not, except as necessary for RSM to perform its obligations under the Supply Agreement, market or sell Improved GOS, or any galacto-oligosaccharides that are of greater purity to any third party.

16
--

 

Pursuant to the terms of the Supply Agreement, as amended on July 24, 2015, we purchased the exclusive worldwide assignment of all right, title and interest to the Improved GOS (the “Improved GOS IP”) on July 30, 2015 for $800,000. We also issued 100,000 shares of our common stock to RSM pursuant to a stock purchase agreement.
 
Under the terms of the Supply Agreement, as amended, if we fail to make any future option payment required under the terms of the Supply Agreement, we may be required to return the Improved GOS IP to RSM. The terms of the Supply Agreement, as amended, require us to pay RSM $400,000 within 10 days following FDA approval of a new drug application for the first product owned or controlled by us using Improved GOS as its active pharmaceutical ingredient.
 
Commercialization
 
Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. RP-G28, if approved, is intended to be prescribed to patients suffering from lactose intolerance. These patients are normally under the care of a gastroenterologist and/or a primary care physician. Our current plan is to evaluate a possible partnership to commercialize RP-G28 for the treatment of lactose intolerance in patients in the United States and Europe if it is approved. We may also build our own commercial infrastructure or utilize contract reimbursement specialists, sales people and medical education specialists, and take other steps to establish the necessary commercial infrastructure at such time as we believe that RP-G28 is approaching marketing approval. Outside of the United States and Europe, subject to obtaining necessary marketing approvals, we will likely seek to commercialize RP-G28 through distribution or other collaboration arrangements for patients suffering from lactose intolerance.
Competition
 
The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Although we know of no drug candidate, other than RP-G28, in advanced clinical trials for treating lactose intolerance, other biopharmaceutical companies may be able to develop compounds or drugs that are able to achieve similar or better results. Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and universities and other research institutions. Some of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies we expect to compete with include microbiome-based development companies such as Second Genome, Inc., Seres Health, Inc., Enterome SA, Vedanta Biosciences, Inc., and Rebiotix, Inc. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. We will also compete with providers of a wide variety of lactase supplements (the most widely used supplement in the United States being Lactaid®), probiotic/dietary supplements, and lactose-free and dairy-free products. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.
Intellectual Property
 
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates and our discovery programs, processes and know-how are important to our business. We have sought patent protection in the United States and internationally for uses of RP-G28 and our discovery programs, and any other inventions to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. We do not have composition of matter patent protection in the United States for RP-G28, which may result in competitors being able to offer and sell products so long as these competitors do not infringe any other patents that we hold, including patents directed to methods of manufacturing and purified RP-G28 or directed to methods of using RP-G28.
 
Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of RP-G28 and any future product candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes from commercial competition. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that issued patents will not be challenged in court as invalid or in the Patent Office as unpatentable. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.”

Patents and Proprietary Rights Covering Our Drug Candidates
 
We strive to protect our product candidates and exclusivity rights, as well as both maintain and fortify our position in the field of reduction of symptoms associated with lactose intolerance. We believe our intellectual property portfolio consists of early and broad filings in the area. We have focused on patents and patent applications directed to use of our products in disease treatment. We have sought and continue to seek the strongest possible intellectual property protection available to us in order to prevent others from directly competing with us, as well as to exclude competition around our products, their manufacture, and methods for use of the products in disease treatment. Our intellectual property portfolio directed to RP-G28 contains four issued patents relating to RP-G28 and its uses. That portfolio also includes at least 15 other related, pending patent applications in the United States and worldwide. We also own a patent family, including claims generally directed to processes for producing an improved form of galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) mixtures (higher purity); this family includes issued patents in United States (not expiring until 2030), Italy (not expiring until 2029), and China, Germany, and the Netherlands (not expiring until 2030), as well as applications pending in the United States, Japan, India, and other jurisdictions that, if issued, will not expire until 2030.
 
This portfolio includes patents and proprietary rights related to:
 

● | U.S. Patent No. 8,486,668, which has a current expiry date of February 17, 2030, includes claims generally directed to methods for treating lactose intolerance comprising administering, for a predetermined number of days, a high purity galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) pharmaceutical composition, and wherein the administration leads to a persistent decrease in at least one symptom of lactose intolerance;

● | Italian Patent No. IT 1,395,068, which has a current expiry date of August 7, 2029 (subject to the payment of annuities), includes claims generally directed to the production of ultra-pure galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) pharmaceutical compositions by utilizing sequential microbiological purifications; and 


● | Chinese Patent No. ZL 201080035013.2, which has a current expiry date of August 6, 2030 (subject to payment of annuities), includes claims generally directed to the production of ultra-pure galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) pharmaceutical compositions by utilizing sequential microbiological purifications. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also are pursuing patent applications. These applications are pending in the United States, Europe, Japan and other jurisdictions, and, if they issue as patents, will not expire until at least 2030, and include claims generally directed to (i) oral dosage forms of a higher purity galacto-ologosaccharides (GOS), (ii) use of galacto-ologosaccharides (GOS) for treating lactose intolerance, and (iii) methods of preventing or reducing certain symptoms of lactose intolerance using galacto-ologosaccharides (GOS) dosage forms. For example, we have paid issue fees (and expect patents to issue in due course) in two United States patent applications: one includes claims directed to an oral dosage forms comprising a prebiotic composition comprising 95% or more galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) by weight and less than 5% digestible saccharides by weight, in which the GOS comprises at least 45% by weight trisaccharides, and the other includes claims directed to oral dosage forms of GOS, comprising 0.1 to 10 g of a liquid GOS composition encapsulated in a gelatin capsule, in which the GOS composition comprises at least about 95% galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) by weight, less than about 5% digestible saccharides by weight, and at least 45% by weight trisaccharides.
 
Trade Secrets
 
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Governmental authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) through the Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) process before they may be legally marketed in Europe. Our product candidates will be subject to similar requirements in other countries prior to marketing in those countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

United States Government Regulation
 
NDA Approval Processes
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and implemented regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable FDA requirements at any time during the product development process or approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:

● | refusal to approve pending applications; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------
● | withdrawal of an approval; 
● | imposition of a clinical hold; 
● | warning letters; 
● | product seizures and/or condemnation and destruction; 
● | total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or 
● | injunctions, fines, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. 

 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLPs”) or other applicable regulations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices (“GCPs”), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
● | submission to the FDA of a marketing application such as a NDA; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and 
● | FDA review and approval of the marketing application. 

 
Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. A sponsor of an IND must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the nonclinical studies, the IND will also include a clinical protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, notifies the sponsor of a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND, and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.
 
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as an amendment to the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually in the IND Annual Report. Sponsors must also report to the FDA, within required timelines, serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. An institutional review board (“IRB”) at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations.

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

● | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2. Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Although there are no statutory or regulatory definitions for Phase 2a and Phase 2b, Phase 2a is commonly used to describe a Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate efficacy, adverse effects and safety risks and Phase 2b is commonly used to describe a subsequent Phase 2 clinical trial that also evaluates dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
● | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 

 
Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings with the FDA may be granted at other times during the development program when requested. For instance, we held a Type C meeting with the FDA’s Division of Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products on February 20, 2013. The purpose of the meeting was to obtain the FDA’s feedback on the planned clinical development program and future necessary clinical studies, inform the FDA of our ongoing development plans, gain feedback on relevant clinical trial design and end points related to patient meaningful benefits, and to inform the FDA of the status of our product characterization. Following analysis of the Phase 2a clinical trial, discussions with the FDA during the Type C Meeting in early 2013 about our clinical development plan, and further discussions with our regulatory consultants, we initiated the Phase 2b clinical trial of RPG-28 in March 2016 and completed final enrollment and dosing in October 2016.
 
FDA meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of the new drug. Sponsors may request a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”), only if the sponsor has already had an end-of-phase 2/pre-phase 3 meeting or end-of-phase 1 meeting as appropriate. The purpose of the SPA is to reach agreement with the FDA on clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim.
 
According to published guidance on the SPA process, a sponsor which meets the prerequisites may make a specific request for a SPA and ask specific questions regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. The FDA has a goal to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. A SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the record. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the testing began.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity and potency of the drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life.
 
The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination of whether it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
 

21
--

 

Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. NDAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and tested.
 
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of RP-G28, one of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA.
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
 
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (“BPCA”), certain drugs may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity, if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA (a Written Request) relating to the use of the active moiety of the drug in children. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a drug in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
 
We have not received a Written Request for such pediatric studies, although we may ask the FDA to issue a Written Request for such studies in the future. To receive the six-month pediatric market exclusivity, we would have to receive a Written Request from the FDA, conduct the requested studies in accordance with a written agreement with the FDA or, if there is no written agreement, in accordance with commonly accepted scientific principles, and submit reports of the studies. A Written Request may include studies for indications that are not currently in the labeling if the FDA determines that such information will benefit the public health. The FDA will accept the reports upon its determination that the studies were conducted in accordance with and are responsive to the original Written Request or commonly accepted scientific principles, as appropriate, and that the reports comply with the FDA’s filing requirements.
 
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) requires all applications (or supplements to an application) submitted under section 505 of the FDCA (21 U.S.C. §355) for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration to contain a pediatric assessment unless the applicant has obtained a waiver or deferral. It also authorizes the FDA to require holders of approved NDAs for marketed drugs to conduct pediatric studies under certain circumstances. In general, PREA applies only to those drugs developed for diseases and/or conditions that occur in both the adult and pediatric populations. Products intended for pediatric-specific indications will be subject to the requirements of PREA only if they are initially developed for a subset of the relevant pediatric population.

As part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, Congress reauthorized both BPCA and PREA, which were slated to expire on September 30, 2012, and made both laws permanent.
 
Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic.
 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
 
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States also may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 
We intend to explore orphan drug designation for RP-G28 for any orphan indication in which there is a medically plausible basis for treatment of the indication through colonic adaptation of gut bacteria.
 
Post-approval Requirements
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
 
Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:
 

● | compliance with cGMPs; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | record-keeping requirements; 
● | reporting of adverse experiences with the drug; 
● | providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information; 
● | drug sampling and distribution requirements; 
● | notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; and 
● | complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.

Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
 
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct.
 
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 
Regulation Outside of the United States
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders or diabetes and optional for those medicines which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
 
Reimbursement
 
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “MMA”) imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”), enacted in March 2010, is expected to have a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA is expected to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA is expected to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. We cannot predict the impact of the ACA on pharmaceutical companies, as many of the ACA reforms require the promulgation of detailed regulations implementing the statutory provisions which has not yet occurred. In addition, some members of the U.S. Congress have been seeking to repeal at least portions of the legislation and we expect they will continue to review and assess this legislation and alternative health care reform proposals. Any legal challenges to the ACA, as well as Congressional efforts to repeal the ACA, add to the uncertainty of the legislative changes enacted as part of the ACA.
 
In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
