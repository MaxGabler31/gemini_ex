Item 1. Business
National Vision Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to here as “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” or “National Vision.” National Vision Holdings, Inc. conducts substantially all of its activities through its direct, wholly-owned subsidiary, National Vision, Inc. (“NVI”), and NVI’s subsidiaries. National Vision is controlled by affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (“KKR Sponsor”) and private equity funds managed by Berkshire Partners LLC (“Berkshire”). KKR Sponsor and Berkshire are collectively referred to herein as the “Sponsors.”
General
We are one of the largest and fastest growing optical retailers in the United States and a leader in the attractive value segment of the U.S. optical retail industry. We believe that vision is central to quality of life and that people deserve to see their best to live their best, no matter what their budget. Our mission is to make quality eye care and eyewear affordable and accessible to all Americans. We achieve this by providing eye exams, eyeglasses and contact lenses to cost-conscious and low-income consumers. We deliver exceptional value and convenience to our customers, with an opening price point that strives to be among the lowest in the industry, enabled by our low-cost operating platform. We reach our customers through a diverse portfolio of 1,013 retail stores across five brands and 18 consumer websites as of December 30, 2017, our 2017 fiscal year end. 
Our History
Through its predecessors, NVI commenced operations in 1990. In 2005, private equity funds managed by Berkshire acquired both NVI and Consolidated Vision Group, Inc., which operated America’s Best stores, and merged these entities, with NVI surviving. In 2009, NVI acquired the Eyeglass World store chain. In 2011, after a multi-year partnership, NVI acquired Arlington Contact Lens Service, Inc. (“AC Lens”) to bolster its e-commerce platform.
In March 2014, NVI was acquired by affiliates of KKR Sponsor (the “KKR Acquisition”). National Vision Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on February 14, 2014 under the name “Nautilus Parent, Inc.” and NVI became our wholly-owned subsidiary in connection with the KKR Acquisition. In 2017, we changed our name to “National Vision Holdings, Inc.” 
In October 2017, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock (the “IPO”). Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “EYE.” Our principal executive offices are located at 2435 Commerce Avenue, Bldg. 2200, Duluth, Georgia 30096. 
Our Business Model
Our history of profitable growth is founded on a commitment to a relatively simple business model: providing exceptional value and convenience to customers, enabled by our low-cost operating platform. Our disciplined approach to new store openings, combined with our attractive store economics, has led to strong returns on investment. The following chart depicts our new store growth:
Note: Represents stores in operations across all five company brands at the end of each fiscal year.

The fundamentals of our model are described below:

• | Differentiated and Defensible Value Proposition. We believe our success is driven by our low prices, convenient locations, broad assortment of branded and private label merchandise and the high levels of in-store service provided by our well-trained and passionate store associates and vision care professionals. We believe our bundled offers, including two-pairs of eyeglasses plus an eye exam for $69.95 at America’s Best and two-pairs of eyeglasses for $78.00 at Eyeglass World, represent among the lowest price offerings of any national chain. Our ability to utilize national advertising for America’s Best allows us to communicate this value proposition to a meaningfully greater number of current and potential customers. We believe that our value proposition will continue to drive comparable store sales growth as we attract new customers and increase loyalty with existing customers.


• | Recurring Revenue Characteristics. Eye care purchases are predominantly a medical necessity and are therefore considered non-discretionary in nature. We estimate that optical consumers typically replace their eyeglasses every two to three years, while contact lens customers typically order new lenses every six to twelve months, reflecting the predictability of these recurring purchase behaviors. This is further demonstrated by the customer mix of our mature stores, with existing customers representing 63% of total customers in 2017 and new customers representing the remaining 37% of total customers in 2017.


• | Attractive Store Economics. Since 2006, we have opened 566 stores in the aggregate, including 490 stores under our America’s Best and Eyeglass World retail brands. Our store economics are based on low capital investment, steady ramping of sales in new locations, low operating costs and consistent sales volume and earnings growth in mature stores, which result in attractive returns on capital. On average, our owned stores achieve profitability shortly after their first-year opening anniversary and pay back invested capital in less than four years. By consistently replicating the key characteristics of our store model, we execute a formula-based approach to opening new stores and managing existing stores, which has delivered predictable store performance across vintages, diverse geographies and new and existing markets.

Our Mission and Philanthropic Efforts
Our mission is to help people by making quality eye care and eyewear more affordable and accessible. Our financial success has helped fuel our ever-growing philanthropic engine. Through multiple charitable partnerships with organizations such as VisionSpring, RestoringVision and Vosh International, we have directly assisted approximately 900,000 individuals to see and have indirectly helped improve the vision of approximately 14 million individuals globally. In addition, through a multi-year partnership with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America we provide free vision screenings, eye exams and eyeglasses to thousands of young Americans. We also work diligently to help a portion of the world’s population who live with uncorrected vision problems. Our philanthropic culture instills a sense of purpose and engagement in our employees, from in-store staff to senior management. Our employees feel pride in the positive work they are doing, which allows us to attract and retain both store associates and vision care professionals, thus improving the customer experience in our stores. In addition, our mission has been essential to the formation and retention of our cohesive management team, whose extensive experience and minimal turnover are unique components of our business success.
Our Business
We are well positioned to serve our new and existing customers through a diverse portfolio of 1,013 retail stores across five brands and 18 consumer websites as of December 30, 2017. We have two reportable segments: our owned & host segment and our legacy segment. Our owned & host segment includes our two owned brands, America’s Best and Eyeglass World, and our Vista Optical locations in Fred Meyer stores. Within this segment, we also provide low-cost vision care products and services to American military service members by operating Vista Optical locations on military bases across the country. Our legacy segment consists of our 27-year strategic relationship with Walmart to operate Vision Centers in select Walmart stores. In addition, our wholly-owned subsidiary, FirstSight, which is licensed as a single-service health plan under California law, issues individual vision care benefit plans in connection with our America’s Best operations in California, and provides or arranges for the provision of optometric services at almost all of the optometric offices next to Walmart and Sam’s Club stores in California. FirstSight also sells contact lenses to its members in certain locations. We support our owned brands and our Vista Optical military operations through our ever-evolving omni-channel offerings and we also have an established standalone e-commerce business. Our e-commerce platform serves our proprietary e-commerce websites and the e-commerce websites of third parties, including Walmart, Sam’s Club and Giant Eagle. The following table provides an overview of our portfolio of brands:

All of our brands leverage our highly-efficient centralized laboratory network and distribution system, which helps us minimize production and distribution costs. As one of the largest purchasers of eyeglass frames, optical lenses and contact lenses in the United States, we also benefit from centralized procurement efforts and purchasing economies of scale.
Our stores present our products in an inviting and engaging atmosphere. Our merchandise is showcased to highlight the products and maximize the appeal of our image and brands. Our stores are clean and spacious, with orderly merchandising and strategic product placements to optimize our selling space, increase productivity and optimize customer flow. We utilize display samples to foster customer interaction with products, while providing price transparency and simplicity. We provide a hands-on, solutions-based service approach and further enhance the customer’s store experience with convenient, time-saving and value-added services.
Our America’s Best Brand. America’s Best strives to be the value leader in virtually every market in which it operates. Its signature offer of two pairs of eyeglasses for $69.95, including a free eye exam, is typically priced significantly lower than the competition on a per-pair basis and provides customers with a wide selection of frame choices at this entry point. In America’s Best stores, vision care services are provided by optometrists employed either by us or by independent professional corporations. This model facilitates the brand’s bundled offer and its Eyecare Club programs, which offer two free eye exams per year for the duration of the membership plus a discount on replacement contact lenses and eyeglasses. By leveraging our efficient centralized laboratory network, America’s Best stores are able to minimize processing costs and drive significant economies of scale. These stores typically stock approximately 1,320 eyeglass frame SKUs, including imports from low-cost overseas manufacturers, higher-margin private label brands and discounted well-known frame brands. America’s Best stores, which average 3,500 square feet, are primarily located in high-traffic strip centers next to similar off-price designer retailers, such as Marshalls stores.
Our Eyeglass World Brand. Eyeglass World also offers a value price point for customers, with an opening offer of “two pairs of eyeglasses for $78” and eye exams starting at $39. This brand is positioned as an eyeglass superstore that caters to a more cost-conscious customer base, with a broader selection of designer brands and price points, and offers more personalized levels of service. We source eyeglass frames for our Eyeglass World stores from leading designer brands, private label manufacturers, overstock inventories and low-cost overseas manufacturers. Eyeglass World locations offer eye exams, primarily from independent optometrists, and have on-site laboratories that enable stores to quickly fulfill customer orders and make repairs. On-site laboratories can process a variety of lens options, with same-

day service. Lens orders that are not completed in-store are completed by our centralized laboratory network. Due to the wider brand selection and on-site laboratories, Eyeglass World stores are larger, averaging approximately 4,500 square feet and typically stocking approximately 1,935 eyeglass frame SKUs. These stores are primarily located in freestanding or in-line locations near high-foot-traffic shopping centers.
Our Partner Brands. We have three partner brands consisting of 227 Vision Centers in Walmart stores across the country, 56 Vista Optical locations on military bases and 29 Vista Optical locations within Fred Meyer stores as of December 30, 2017. We have strong, long-standing relationships with these partners. Our strategic relationship with Walmart extends over 27 years and our partnerships with Fred Meyer and the U.S. military have been maintained for over 18 years. Our partner brands all compete within the value segment of the U.S. optical retail industry, with a starting price point for a pair of eyeglasses in the $38 to $99 range. These brands combine a broad selection of products and attentive customer service with the convenience of one-stop shopping. These brands also utilize our centralized laboratories and provide eye exams principally by independent optometrists in nearly all locations. Our partner brands are attractive businesses with relatively light capital requirements.
Our Omni-Channel and E-Commerce Platforms. We offer our customers an engaging digital shopping experience through an established platform of four store websites, three of which are omni-channel, and 14 dedicated e-commerce consumer websites. Our three omni-channel websites augment our America’s Best, Eyeglass World and Vista Optical in military brands and provide a customer experience that extends across our in-store, mobile and e-commerce channels. We offer a range of services to customers, including eyeglass purchasing for our America’s Best stores and Vista Optical locations on U.S. military bases, online scheduling and appointment reminders, contact lens purchasing, “buy-in-store and ship-to-home” capabilities, online frame browsing and virtual frame try-on, among others. Our omni-channel offerings work in concert with these brands to enhance the overall quality of the customer experience.
Our 14 dedicated e-commerce websites are managed by our subsidiary, AC Lens. AC Lens operates six proprietary branded websites, including aclens.com and discountcontacts.com. In addition, AC Lens operates and provides support services for eight third-party websites owned by other companies, including Walmart, Sam’s Club and Giant Eagle. AC Lens handles site management, customer relationship management and order fulfillment and also sells a wide variety of contact lenses, eyeglasses and eye care accessories. In the aggregate, sales from our omni-channel and e-commerce platforms represented approximately 3.5% of our net revenue in fiscal year 2017.
Our Industry
Overview. The U.S. optical retail industry, defined by Vision Monday to include optical retailers’ revenues from the sales of products (including managed vision care benefit revenues and omni-channel and e-commerce sales) and eye care services provided by vision care professionals, including eye exams, is a $35 billion industry that has exhibited consistent, stable growth across economic cycles. According to Vision Monday, over the period from 2007 to 2016, the industry grew from $26 billion to $35 billion in annual sales, representing a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 3.4%. The industry experienced only a modest decline of approximately 3.8% during the 2008 to 2009 recession and rebounded with robust post-recession sales growth of 4.6% CAGR from 2009 to 2016, according to Vision Monday. The steady growth of the industry and its resilience to economic cycles is due in large part to the medical, non-discretionary and recurring nature of eye care purchases.

The majority of eyewear purchases are driven by need, with two primary drivers of demand: (i) diminishing eyesight with increasing age, causing new customers to buy corrective eyewear and (ii) a steady and consistent replacement cycle, as customers frequently replace or purchase new eyewear for a variety of reasons, including changes in prescriptions, fashion trends and necessity (e.g., lost or broken eyewear).
The need for eyesight correction is diagnosed through eye tests and eye exams. 
We anticipate that there are four key secular growth trends that will continue to contribute to the stability and growth of the U.S. optical retail industry:

• | Aging Population. According to The Vision Council, approximately 76% of adults in the United States used some form of vision correction as of September 2016. At age 45, the need for vision correction begins to increase significantly, with approximately 86% of adults in the United States between the ages of 45 and 54 and approximately 92% of adults in the United States aged 55 and older using vision correction, according to The Vision Council. As the U.S. population ages and life expectancy increases, the pool of potential customers and opportunities for repeat purchases in the optical retail industry are anticipated to rise. In 2014, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that approximately 42% of the U.S. population would be 45 years old or older by 2020 (the 0.9% increase from 2015 population projections implies an additional 8.4 million adults will enter this 45-plus demographic by 2020). Given that eyesight deteriorates progressively with age, aging of the U.S. population should result in incremental sales of eyewear and related accessories.


• | Frequent Replacement Cycle. The repetitive and predictable nature of customer behavior results in a significant volume of recurring revenue for the optical retail industry. The purchasing cycle of vision correction devices is closely tied to the frequency with which consumers obtain eye exams. Most optometrists recommend annual eye exams as a preventive measure against serious eye conditions and to help patients identify changes in their vision correction needs. According to The Vision Council, an estimated 189 million people in the United States using vision correction devices in 2015 received nearly 114 million eye exams that year, implying an average interval between exams of 20 months. The interval between exams contributes to the industry’s stability and shortening this interval represents an opportunity to increase the frequency of customer purchases.


• | Increased Usage of Computer and Mobile Screens. Due to the proliferation of smartphones, laptops and tablets, the U.S. population has experienced a dramatic increase in the amount of time spent viewing electronic screens. According to The Vision Council, almost 90% of Americans use digital devices for two or more hours each day, with almost 60% using them for five or more hours each day and approximately 70% using multiple devices simultaneously. This is anticipated to result in a larger percentage of the population suffering from screen-related vision problems, driving incremental sales of vision correction devices, such as traditional eyeglasses and contact lenses, as well as higher margin products designed specifically to counteract the effect of looking at screens for prolonged stretches of time.

• | Growing Focus on Health and Wellness. The optical retail industry is poised to benefit from expansive trends underlying an increasing societal focus on health and wellness. Consumers want personalized solutions that allow them to make informed decisions about their health. Additionally, rising healthcare costs are driving a growing emphasis on preventative healthcare. Eye exams can detect a host of physical ailments, such as hypertension or diabetes, and are one of the most inexpensive and effective forms of detection for many of these conditions. As consumers continue to develop greater awareness of health and wellness issues, there is an opportunity for retailers that are able to offer personalized, inexpensive, health-oriented products and services that can increase quality of life and reduce an individual’s overall level of healthcare expenditures. Furthermore, this increased focus on health means that people are living longer, which increases the overall demand for vision care and the frequency with which people visit their eye care practitioners for vision care products and services.

Value Chains Gaining Market Share in Optical Retail Industry. Providing consumers with quality vision care and products involves multiple steps and several parties. In the process of purchasing vision care products a consumer will interact directly with eye care practitioners who prescribe (and may also dispense) products. Consumers may likewise interact with optical retail outlets which dispense products, and may offer on-site optometry services to increase customers’ convenience. Retailers also assist consumers in selecting and fitting vision care products and, directly or through third parties, manufacture and finish vision care products and their components. As part of the purchase, the consumer and retailer may interact with an insurance company or managed vision care provider. Further, vision care and optical retail require compliance with numerous regulations, which often vary by state. The industry experience and knowledge to initiate and maintain relationships across all of these parties is crucial to the success of optical retailers.
There are several types of optical retailers with differing approaches to fulfilling consumer needs at each step of the vision care process. The types of optical retailers include independent eye care practitioners, multi-doctor purchasing alliances, national and regional optical retail chains, mass merchant/warehouse club retail chains and e-commerce. Some optical retail chains, like us, have vertically integrated some or all of the sectors of the industry. However, the industry remains highly fragmented.
Several key factors drive the changing dynamics across the optical retail market:

• | Optical Retail Chains Gaining Market Share From Independents. As a result of customers’ desire for the convenience of a one-stop shop with broad product selection, strong customer service and competitive prices, larger optical retailers have gained market share from independent practitioners over the past approximately 20 years, with total market share of the ten largest optical retailers in the United States increasing from 18% in 1992 to 32% in 2016 according to 20/20 magazine and Vision Monday. Despite this growth, the top ten optical retailers still have a relatively small share of the overall market and the largest optical retailers are well-positioned to continue increasing their share.


• | Value Chains Are Growing Faster Than Industry. According to Vision Monday estimates, from 2007 to 2016, the value segment of the U.S. optical retail industry grew at a CAGR of 6.6%, nearly twice the rate of the broader optical retail industry. Increased consumer cost consciousness has shifted market share toward value optical retail chains and mass merchants that serve the value segment. To the extent this trend continues, the value segment is expected to continue to outpace overall industry growth.


• | E-commerce. The optical retail industry is currently underpenetrated in the e-commerce channel relative to other categories of retail. This is due to inherent penetration barriers that make optical retail better suited for omni-channel offerings rather than pure e-commerce. Although contact lenses lend themselves more to online purchases than do eyeglasses, users still generally need to visit an eye care practitioner or a store to update their prescription. Such visits are an opportunity to sell an annual supply of contact lenses to the customer.

Optometrists, Ophthalmologists and Opticians. Within the vision care industry, there are multiple providers of eye care and vision services, including optometrists, ophthalmologists and opticians.

• | Optometrists are healthcare professionals who have received a four-year doctor of optometry, or OD, degree and are licensed to perform vision tests, prescribe and dispense vision correction devices such as eyeglasses and contact lenses, perform diagnostic eye exams and prescribe certain types of ocular medication. In a few states, optometrists may also perform surgery.


• | Ophthalmologists are medical doctors specializing in vision and eye care. These doctors are licensed to prescribe medication and perform surgery and may also perform eye exams and dispense vision correction products.

9


• | Opticians are technicians who use prescriptions written by optometrists or ophthalmologists to dispense corrective eyeglasses and contact lenses. However, they are not licensed to diagnose or treat ocular conditions. Most states do not license the practice of opticianry.

Product Categories and Suppliers. The optical retail market consists of multiple product categories, including vision correction devices such as eyeglass lenses, frames and contact lenses and other products and services, including sunglasses, eyeglass accessories and refractive surgery.

• | Eyeglass frames are generally available in a wide range of materials, styles, designs and brands. The most common materials used to manufacture frames include plastic, cellulose acetate and metal. For many customers, eyeglasses are not only an eye care solution but also a fashion accessory, and therefore brand and aesthetics are important factors in customers’ purchasing decisions. There are many recognized eyeglass frame brands, some of which are controlled by vertically-integrated optical retail chains. There are numerous suppliers that offer unbranded, white-label or generic eyeglass frames.


• | Eyeglass lenses are manufactured using a range of standard and proprietary organic and inorganic materials. Customers generally have the option of selecting individualized features such as lightweight designs, photochromatic capabilities and special coatings for ultraviolet protection, anti-fog, anti-reflection, anti-scratch protection. There are several global manufacturers of lenses, with some additionally offering integrated lens finishing services through owned optical laboratories.


• | Contact lenses are available in soft or rigid formats. Soft lenses are typically made from silicone hydrogels and are often characterized by the period of use (primarily daily disposable or monthly reusable). Rigid lenses are typically made with oxygen-permeable polymers and can often be used for several years without replacement. Contact lenses are primarily manufactured by a relatively concentrated group of four major suppliers. Re-useable contact lenses require the regular use of cleaning solutions. Demand for contact lenses is driven by structural growth, as more consumers come to recognize the benefits of the more comfortable modern lenses and existing contact lens users switch to monthly, weekly or daily disposable lenses. Despite the attractiveness of contact lens usage, most consumers do not rely exclusively on contact lenses, opting to also purchase traditional eyeglasses for secondary use.


• | Sunglasses are also sold by many optical retailers. These sunglasses can come with or without prescription lenses, and are worn both for fashion and protection of the eyes from UV rays. Sunglasses are more of a discretionary purchase than prescription eyewear, and sales of sunglasses are therefore more sensitive to the economic environment. According to The Vision Council, for most optical retailers (as opposed to non-prescription sunglass retailers), prescription sunglasses make up the majority of their sunglass sales.


• | Refractive surgery offers a permanent solution to vision correction problems. The most common refractive surgical procedures are LASIK and PRK. Both technologies utilize lasers to reshape the curvature of the cornea. Due to the high cost, lack of insurance coverage, potential for side effects and invasive nature of the procedures, refractive surgery as a method of vision correction has low penetration relative to traditional eyeglasses or contact lenses.

Optical Laboratories. Optical laboratories transform semi-finished and finished lenses to match the specifications from an optician or prescriber’s order and fit them into the requested eyeglass frames. The process entails surfacing and polishing the lens, followed by the application of any requested special coatings. Some retailers have in-store laboratories to provide convenience and speed to customers. Laboratories can also be operated on a centralized basis by the retailer or on an outsourced basis, offering economies of scale and expertise across a wide range of lens types and prescriptions.
Third Party Payors. Similar to other healthcare services, optical retail chains often receive payment for services and products from third parties, including managed vision care programs, other insurance programs and government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Managed care has become increasingly important to the optical retail industry. Managed vision care programs provide benefits across all optical retail sales channels, including independent eye care practitioners and national and regional chains, though some managed care programs are affiliated with specific integrated optical retail chains. According to The Vision Council, managed care accounts for a substantial percentage of sales of prescription eyeglasses and, in the 12 months ended September 30, 2016, approximately half of the U.S. adult population surveyed stated they were enrolled in vision care plans. Moreover, the enrolled child population is increasing, as federal health care reform includes pediatric vision as a covered benefit. These trends could be reversed, however, if federal health care reform is repealed or its scope is reduced.
Our Competitive Advantages
10

We are one of the largest and fastest growing optical retailers in the United States and a leader in the attractive value segment of the U.S. optical retail industry. We believe that a number of factors have established our market-leading position and differentiate us from our competitors. These include: our value positioning and compelling customer offers, decades of brand building, low-cost operating model, store network and portfolio of brands, size and scale, strong industry partnerships, highly-experienced management team and disciplined real estate strategy, among others.
Highly-differentiated and Defensible Value Proposition. Our value price positioning extends across our entire portfolio of brands. We offer among the lowest price points in the optical retail industry and this highly-compelling customer value positioning has been a critical driver of our outsized market share gains and revenue growth. Through its arrangements with individual optometrists or professional corporations owned by eye care practitioners, America’s Best is able to offer customers two distinctive bundled eyewear pricing offers: (i) the two pairs of eyeglasses offer for $69.95, including an eye exam, and (ii) the Eyecare Club program, which offers several years of eye exams plus a discount on products for a low price. In addition, Eyeglass World’s opening price point offer of two pairs of eyeglasses for $78.00 is among the lowest in our industry. Based on a recent study of leading optical retailers and based on these bundled offers, we believe that America’s Best and Eyeglass World’s opening price points for eyeglasses and an eye exam are currently 74% and 37% lower on a per-pair basis than the next lowest retailer surveyed and 82% and 56% lower than the average of independent retailers surveyed, respectively, each as indicated in the following chart:

We are also committed to providing our customers with high levels of in-store customer service and a convenient and compelling shopping experience. On-site optometrists enable a convenient one-stop shop for the clinically-assisted sale of eye exams and eyewear and attract customers. The quality care provided by vision care professionals is then complemented by our highly-trained in-store sales associates. Through one-on-one consultations, we can better understand the complete scope of our customers’ needs and recommend the appropriate products and services. Our customers are then able to choose from a broad assortment of frames, including high-quality designer and private label frames, and contact lenses. We believe that the comprehensive proposition of our value pricing, the breadth and quality of our product mix and high levels of customer service drive repeat visits and customer loyalty, engagement and ambassadorship.

Our optical retail offerings are also more defensible to potential e-commerce pressure relative to other categories of retail. This is due to inherent penetration barriers that make optical retail better suited for omni-channel offerings rather than pure e-commerce. Eye exams typically involve in-person visits to eye care practitioners or stores and customers generally want to try eyeglasses on before purchasing, as slight changes in style, size and color can make a meaningful difference to the functionality and visual appeal of the eyeglass frame. Lastly, the service and sales consultations provided by our on-site vision care professionals and in-store associates are a key part of the vision correction product purchase process, which cannot be replicated online.
Leading Low-cost Operating Model. Our low-cost structure allows us to maintain our low prices to our customers while generating attractive margins. This low-cost structure is a result of our highly-efficient laboratory network and manufacturing capabilities. Orders are routed via a centralized proprietary system to the appropriate processing laboratory, minimizing cost and delivery time. Through a combination of volume increases, continuous operating efficiency improvements and implementation of technological enhancements across our laboratory network, we have increased the number of orders processed through our laboratory network and reduced the cost per job. This has allowed us to maintain our introductory offer of two-pairs of eyeglasses and an eye exam for $69.95 at America’s Best for over ten years.
Our scale and business model allow us to benefit from procurement and real estate cost structure advantages as well as efficiencies in advertising spend and corporate management. As a result of these factors, we are able to drive attractive profitable growth while maintaining industry-low prices for our customers.
Best-in-class Management Team With Deep Optical Experience. Our Company is led by a highly-accomplished and proven management team with deep expertise. The current team is one of the longest-tenured in the optical retail industry. Collectively, this team has a wide range of experience across optical merchandising, store openings, customer engagement, operations, omni-channel platform and technology. Combining this operational expertise with a finely-tuned formulaic playbook, management has achieved an impressive long-term track record of significant industry outperformance.
Diverse Portfolio of Attractive Brands. We have a differentiated collection of five complementary brands, four of which are supported by either our omni-channel or e-commerce platform that all target the fast-growing value segment within the U.S. optical retail industry. America’s Best and Eyeglass World, our owned brands, have been the primary source of our store growth. Our partner brands (Vision Centers in Walmart and Vista Optical in Fred Meyer stores and on U.S. military bases) are based in well-known, high-traffic environments, exhibit low capital intensity and generate reliable cash flow. Our omni-channel and e-commerce platforms allow us to capture digital sales, deliver several customer convenience capabilities and serve as an educational resource for our customers. 
Proven Real Estate Site Selection Process. We locate our owned stores in highly-desirable retail developments surrounded by dense concentrations of our target customers. We maintain a disciplined approach to new store growth and perform comprehensive market research before selecting a new site based on customer demographics and data from our existing customer database. Our data-driven approach and consistent new store model have resulted in strong performance across our store base. We have rarely closed or relocated a store due to underperformance, and our five-year rolling average new store success rate-defined as the percentage of stores opened in the last five years that are still open-was 99% as of December 30, 2017. We have long-standing relationships with many leading commercial real estate firms and believe that we are a preferred tenant given our brands and the high volume of customers that visit our stores. As a result, we believe we will continue to have access to desirable retail sites.
Strong Partnerships With Retail Partners and Vendors. We have developed extensive and long-term strategic relationships with our frame and lens suppliers, our host and legacy partners and managed vision care companies. Our highly-experienced procurement team leverages long-standing relationships with our vendors to source all of our products. Our strong vendor relationships and scale allow us to maintain broad, on-trend assortments, competitive pricing and favorable payment terms. We have maintained and broadened relationships with our host and legacy partners over several decades. For example, in 2012, we expanded our relationship with Walmart to manage walmartcontacts.com and samsclubcontacts.com and to undertake the back-end logistics and fulfilment services for Walmart’s “ship-to-home” contact lens sales and for virtually all of Sam’s Club contact lens orders. We have also developed strong relationships with managed vision care companies through our network of stores, efficient billing and focus on value. We continually seek to partner with additional managed vision care payors, and to increase participation in our partners’ networks. We believe that our above-market growth is also an attractive growth driver for our business partners and positions us as a preferred retailer for key vendors and industry partners.
Deep Experience with the Regulatory Complexity of the Optical Industry. There are extensive and diverse sets of laws and regulations governing the provision of vision care. As a result, regulatory compliance for optical retailers in the United States is complicated and time-consuming, involving many regulatory bodies and licensing agencies at both 
12

the federal and state levels. We believe that our deep knowledge of the optical regulatory framework and our significant compliance experience provide us with an important competitive advantage. We also believe that these compliance and licensure requirements, and related costs, serve as a significant hurdle for potential new entrants into the optical retail industry.
Our Growth Strategies 
We intend to further drive growth from five distinct sources: growing our store base, increasing comparable store sales, optimizing our existing business, leveraging technology and exploiting strategic opportunities.
Grow Our Store Base. We believe that our expansion opportunities in the United States are significant. We have adopted a disciplined expansion strategy designed to leverage the strengths of our compelling and distinct value proposition and recognized America’s Best and Eyeglass World brand names to develop new stores successfully in an array of markets that are primed for growth, including new, existing, small and large markets. In the aggregate, we have opened 498 stores on a net basis (opened 566 new stores and closed 68 stores) since 2006 and in the past three years, we have increased our new store growth to approximately 75 new stores per annum. We have an established partnership with a third party real estate firm to evaluate potential new America’s Best and Eyeglass World stores and our analysis suggests that we can grow America’s Best to at least 1,000 stores and Eyeglass World to at least 850 stores, inclusive of those already open. We believe that these two brands can accordingly grow from approximately 700 stores as of 2017 to a total of at least 1,850 stores, with similar economics to the existing store base. In the near term, our primary focus will continue to be to open new America’s Best stores, most notably in California as well as Northern New Jersey and parts of the New York metro area, with a longer-term focus on expanding our Eyeglass World store footprint. We believe that our consistent track record of successfully opening stores across vintages, geographies and markets demonstrates our ability to further increase our store count and, as a result, we believe that our current level of new store growth of approximately 75 stores per annum is sustainable for the foreseeable future.
Drive Comparable Store Sales Growth. We expect that our value proposition will generate profitable comparable store sales growth. The vast majority of our comparable store sales growth over the past five years has been driven by increased traffic. The typical eyewear replacement cycle, which we estimate is two to three years, creates substantial opportunity for us to increase sales from our existing customer base. We continually strive to improve our in-store shopping experience and to enhance our solutions-based service approach to increase the volume of customer traffic to our stores. We also expect to increase customer traffic by improving marketing programs and omni-channel offerings, and by expanding our participation in managed vision care programs. We are currently underpenetrated in the managed vision care market relative to the broader optical retail industry. We expect that these initiatives collectively will help us to attract new customers to our stores and increase the frequency of purchases by our existing customers.
Improve Operating Productivity. We believe that our continued growth will provide further opportunities to improve operating margin over time. Growth, both in revenue and stores, will enable us to leverage corporate overhead, our centralized laboratory network and our advertising spend. We expect to benefit from our national network television advertising campaign for America’s Best, which we believe is more cost effective than local market campaigns. This national campaign has helped raise our brand awareness in both existing and new markets, allowing us to save advertising spend when entering new markets. We also believe that continued efficiencies in store operations and technological advancements in our centralized laboratory network will further enhance margins.
Leverage Technology to Optimize and Expand the Business. Our experienced management team has consistently leveraged innovative strategies to grow our business and remain at the forefront of technological development in the optical retail industry. We have invested significantly in technological improvements to position us for future growth. We have implemented software solutions that allow omni-channel purchases to be linked to a “single view of the customer” and to offer a seamless experience across our in-store, mobile and e-commerce channels designed to enable stronger customer communication and to drive traffic to our stores and websites. Going forward, we plan to continue investing in software solutions that further develop our omni-channel platform and enhance our customer engagement capabilities, and we will also continue to invest in tools to improve the quality of the in-store eye exam experience. Since eye exams are a critical service element of our business, we believe that investing in technology to improve this experience will aid in retention of both customers and optometric talent. We are regularly presented with opportunities to invest in technological innovators across the optical retail industry and we have invested $8.6 million in venture-backed emerging companies since June 2014. We believe that these investments provide direct access to optical technology innovators, giving us a deeper understanding of emerging trends and developments. We are thus in a better position to evolve our products and services to meet the needs of our customers.
Explore Strategic Opportunities. We will selectively evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities from time to time as part of our growth strategy.

Our Products and Services
Within our two reportable segments, we primarily offer two products and one service: eyeglasses, contact lenses and eye exams. Nonetheless, our diverse product portfolio encompasses many brand names and thousands of SKUs. Depending on the brand, our stores display approximately 600 to 1,935 eyeglass frame SKUs, covering all age groups. Offerings include both brand name designers, like Ray-Ban, Guess and Calvin Klein, as well as private label options at attractive prices. Our frames are manufactured by market leaders such as Luxottica, Marchon and Zyloware, as well as private label brands made for us in Asia. We also offer a broad portfolio of lenses, including single vision and bifocal lenses, with a variety of treatments to enhance vision. Through one-on-one consultative-selling, our sales associates have a number of opportunities to share information about value-added lenses, including thinner lenses and photochromatic options, which carry higher margins. As a result, a significant number of America’s Best customers and Eyeglass World customers who purchase eyeglasses choose upgraded lenses and/or frames instead of each brand’s base offer. We also offer contact lenses and accessories from all major contact lens manufacturers, including our own private label brand (Sofmed, made by CooperVision) that is offered in our America’s Best and Eyeglass World stores. Collectively, our broad product offerings deliver consistent financial results and reduce our reliance on any individual product, style or trend.
In both of our reportable segments, eye exam services are provided by optometrists employed by us or by professional corporations owned by eye care practitioners with whom we have contractual arrangements or by independent optometrists who have not formed such corporations and with whom we have contracted.
Within our owned & host segment, America’s Best offers its Eyecare Club programs primarily to its contact lens customers. As of December 30, 2017, the Eyecare Club had approximately 1.3 million active members. Benefits of the Eyecare Club include two free eye exams per year for the duration of the multi-year membership, 10% off all replacement contact lenses and eyeglasses and other periodic benefits and discounts, such as free samples of contact lens solutions. Memberships can be purchased in stores or on our America’s Best website. Two separate club memberships are available: the three-year Silver membership, which costs $99, and the five-year Gold membership, which costs $139. By comparison, the cost of a contact lens exam, exclusive of the Eyecare Club, is $79. There is a high adoption rate of Eyecare Club membership by America’s Best customers who are not part of a managed care program and who visited an America’s Best store for a contact lens examination. The disposable nature of contact lenses means that customers must replenish their contacts frequently, and in order to refill their prescriptions, contact lens users must have a current prescription. For a prescription to be current, customers generally need to have an eye exam every one or two years, depending on the state in which they reside. The multi­year nature of these memberships facilitates repeat traffic to America’s Best stores for exams and contact lens purchases and builds customer loyalty. The Eyecare Club also has attractive working capital characteristics, as customers pay the full membership cost at the time that they join. 
See Note 14. “Segment Reporting” in our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II. Item 8. of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Our Customers
Our customers need to see their best to perform their jobs, care for their families and contribute to their communities. Purchasing decisions are based on value, quality of service, fashion, location and eye health, among others. Based on a variety of third-party research studies, we have found that our customers typically prioritize value and convenience above other considerations. Value encompasses a combination of eye health with quality products and services, all offered at a fair price. Convenience encompasses multiple vectors: (i) retail locations near where our customers work and shop, with easy, convenient parking, (ii) store hours that fit their lifestyles, (iii) product selection that achieves aesthetic and/or fashion goals, (iv) availability of on-site eye exams and (v) acceptance of certain vision insurance benefits.
For our two owned brands, we have developed specific customer demographic profiles. More specifically, we estimate that our typical America’s Best customer has a household income between $35,000 to $100,000, is a high school graduate, holds a blue collar job and is between 35 to 64 years old, while our typical Eyeglass World customer is slightly more affluent, has a college degree or higher, holds a professional or technical job and is between 35 to 79 years old. These profiles demonstrate that, even within the same market, our America’s Best and Eyeglass World brands appeal to and attract a different consumer, which speaks favorably to our growth potential and our ability to open new stores of both brands in the same markets.
14

Our Sales and Marketing
We developed our marketing strategy based on the in-depth knowledge we have of our customers. Our brands are positioned to stand for low prices and great value, which resonate with our target consumers and leave a lasting impression that is distinct from the competition.
We believe that television is a key channel for connecting with our customers. Approximately two-thirds of America’s Best and Eyeglass World’s advertising expenditures are on traffic-driving television advertisements, which we leverage broadly across multiple stores in each television market to gain a larger share of voice, and, in turn, drive traffic and margins. Our recent America’s Best expansion into California has allowed us to shift from local campaigns to purchasing television advertising nationally, starting in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, which we believe is more cost effective. We expect that this national campaign will raise our brand awareness in both existing and new markets, allowing us to save advertising spend when entering new markets.
For our host and legacy brands, we rely on our host and legacy partners’ marketing initiatives to drive traffic into their stores, and then we develop and execute highly targeted local marketing campaigns within stores to create awareness of our service and product offerings.
Our customer relationship management (“CRM”) system is used to collect customer demographic data. With this information and the third-party data that we use to supplement the customer information, we create targeted mailing lists (both direct mail and email) to send communications to our customers based on their vision needs and interests to help improve retention of our existing customers. In addition to our CRM program, digital advertising is a critical component of our media mix, as we believe both of these programs generate a high rate of return. Potential customers gain awareness of our brands through paid and organic digital efforts via content, video and social media that lead them to our websites.
Our Sourcing and Supplier Relationships
We purchase our merchandise from a wide variety of vendors, with no vendor accounting for more than 20% of our total cost of products sold. We are a large customer for all of our suppliers and we strive to form meaningful, long-lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with our vendors. We have long-term contracts with certain of our suppliers, including Essilor and CooperVision. Under our agreement with Essilor, Essilor has the sole and exclusive right to supply certain lenses for eyeglasses to us. Our agreement with Essilor expires on December 31, 2018, automatically renewing for one-year terms unless a party elects to terminate upon 90 days’ written notice. We are collaborative in our vendor negotiations so as to develop a partnership with our vendors and, in time, a sense of loyalty to National Vision. Each of our top ten vendors has been with us for at least ten years, and several of these vendors have been with us since our inception in 1990. We focus on sourcing low-cost products, including discounted well-known frame brands, secondary frame brands, direct import frames and private label contact lenses under our Sofmed label. By investing in our sourcing operations, we have increased our direct importation of eyeglass frames, which has enabled us to offer high quality frames at low prices while also generating strong gross margins.
Our Optical Laboratories
We use a highly-efficient mix of three domestic, company-operated processing facilities and two international, outsourced facilities. We have state-of-the-art lens processing capabilities in our three, geographically-diverse company-operated production facilities in Lawrenceville, Georgia, St. Cloud, Minnesota and Salt Lake City, Utah. In addition, we intend to enter into a lease for an additional laboratory facility in 2018 and expect the laboratory to be operational in time for the first quarter 2019. Our centralized optical laboratories handle all aspects of customizing eyeglass lenses, and have digital capabilities for grinding, coating and edging to customer prescription and eyeglass frame specifications. We have developed a high-volume, low-cost lens processing model to provide seven-day turnaround service through our domestic owned laboratories and our international partner laboratories. This network was created through significant investment by us, and is leveraged across our portfolio of brands in both segments to provide efficiency and scale. We route eyeglass orders to both our owned and outsourced laboratories through an automated decision tree that incorporates information on (i) the nature of the job; (ii) the technical capabilities of each laboratory; (iii) the capacity of each laboratory; (iv) the inventory at each laboratory; and (v) the cost of that particular type of job at each laboratory. This architecture is integrated with the point-of-sale system and enables us to minimize our processing costs, while ensuring on-time deliveries. The processing system is designed such that the more eyeglasses we sell, the more efficient the laboratories become, creating significant cost savings over time. 
In addition, our Eyeglass World stores are equipped with on-site laboratories, which typically process less complicated customer orders with same-day service. On-site laboratories can process a variety of lens options. For fiscal year 2017, over half of Eyeglass World in-store customer orders were processed entirely in the store. All lens orders that are not processed or completed in-store are processed or completed by our centralized laboratory network.
15

Our Distribution Network
Our approximately 66,000 square foot distribution center in Lawrenceville, Georgia is located near our corporate offices in Duluth, Georgia. We utilize third-party carriers to transport all of our products from this distribution center to our stores.
Our approximately 52,000 square foot distribution center in Columbus, Ohio is located close to the headquarters of our AC Lens subsidiary. We utilize third-party carriers to transport our products from this distribution center directly to customers and to store locations for our partners.
We believe that the size and scalability of our distribution centers is more than sufficient to support our future expansion over the next four to five years.
Our Employees
As of December 30, 2017, we had 10,902 full-time and part-time employees, inclusive of employees of the professional corporations with which we contract. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced a strike or work stoppage, and we believe that our relations with employees are excellent.
Managed Vision Care
We are currently underpenetrated in the managed care market relative to the broader optical retail industry, and we believe that this represents an important opportunity for us in the future. Although we have relationships with many of the major insurance and vision care companies, we believe that there are opportunities for us to expand existing relationships as well as to create new ones. We strive to create a high-quality, high-satisfaction experience for both our in-store customers and managed care partners. Through our point-of-sale system and our back-office electronic data interchange, or EDI, capabilities, we attempt to create a seamless transactional experience for our in-store managed care customers. From time to time, vision care insurance payors may make changes to their EDI claim systems. Such changes may require us to update our processes and could impact our ability to submit claims or to timely receive reimbursements from our managed care partners. As such, when asked, we have assisted a number of our larger vision care insurance payors to either implement or improve their EDI claim systems. 
We monitor both industry and national healthcare changes and are well-positioned to take advantage of these changes due to our low-cost offerings and strong electronic infrastructure. We expect to continue to grow the managed care component of our business through our relationships and partnership initiatives with managed care payors.
Competition
The optical retail industry is highly competitive. Competition is generally based upon brand name recognition, price, convenience, selection, service and product quality.
We operate within the value segment of the U.S. optical retail industry, which emphasizes price and value. This segment is fragmented. We compete with mass merchants and warehouse club stores, specialty retail chains and independent eye care practitioners and opticians. In the broader optical retail industry, we also compete with large national retailers such as (in alphabetical order) LensCrafters, Pearle Vision and Visionworks. This competition takes place both in physical retail locations and online.
We also compete with online sellers of contact lenses and eyewear. The online sale of contact lenses has steadily increased in particular since the passage of the Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act. See Part I. Item 1. “Business-Government Regulation.” The online sale of eyeglasses has not developed as quickly, but a number of firms are focused on this market, including Warby Parker and Zenni Optical. We also face potential competition from companies that employ emerging technologies in the optical industry, including, for example, online vision exams and 3D printing of eyewear.
We also compete to be a provider under managed care contracts, which can provide us with access to new customers and also allow us to better serve our customers who are covered by managed care by filing claims directly with the payor and collecting only the applicable co-pay amount from these customers. Competition is based on many factors, including price and the density of the provider network. Several large managed care payors are vertically integrated, with substantial retail networks. We have, in the past, and may, in the future, experience heightened challenges to be admitted as a provider to these networks or to maintain our status in them.
Seasonality
Our business is moderately seasonal in nature. Historically, our business has realized a higher portion of revenue, operating income and cash flows from operations in the first fiscal quarter, and a lower portion of net revenue, operating income and cash flows from operations in the fourth fiscal quarter. The seasonally larger first quarter is attributable 
16

primarily to the timing of our customers’ income tax refunds and annual health insurance program start/reset periods. We believe that many customers in our target market, which consists of cost-conscious and low-income consumers, rely on tax refunds to pay for eyewear and eye care. A delay in the issuance of tax refunds can accordingly have a negative impact on our financial results. Consumers could also alter how they utilize tax refund proceeds.
With respect to our fourth quarter results, compared to other retailers, our products and services are less likely to be included in consumer’s holiday spending budgets, therefore reducing spending on personal vision correction during the weeks preceding December 25 of each year. Additionally, although the period between December 25 and the end of our fiscal year is typically a high-volume period, the net revenue associated with substantially all orders of prescription eyeglasses and contact lenses during that period is deferred until January due to our policy of recognizing revenue only after the product has been accepted by the customer, further contributing to higher first quarter results. Our quarterly results may also be affected by the timing of new store openings and store closings, the amount of sales contributed by new and existing stores, as well as the timing of certain holidays.
Information Technology
Information technology systems are critical to our day-to-day operations as well as to our long-term growth strategies. Our systems are designed to deliver a consistent, scalable, high-performing and secure experience for our customers and partners. We utilize a combination of co-location data center and cloud-based solutions for our infrastructure and the majority of our applications consist of standard, integrated software solutions. Our systems provide the data analysis and automation necessary to support our marketing, merchandising, inventory, distribution, store operations and point-of-sale, e-commerce, finance, accounting and human resources initiatives. We believe our current systems allow us to identify and respond to operating trends in our business.
Since 2011, we have modernized our point-of-sale system, upgraded multiple financial package components and are currently implementing software systems to enhance the growth of our omni-channel and customer engagement efforts. We believe this implementation, along with maintenance of our existing information technology capabilities, will provide the flexibility and capacity to accommodate our future growth plans.
Intellectual Property
We own a number of registered and common law trademarks and pending applications for trademark registrations in the United States, primarily through our subsidiaries, including: America’s Best, America’s Best & design, America’s Best Contacts & Eyeglasses, America’s Best Contacts & Eyeglasses & design, America’s Best Vision Plan, America’s Best owl mascot image, the slogan “It’s not just a better deal. It’s America’s Best.,” Eyeglass World, Eyeglass World logos, the slogans “See yourself smile. See yourself save.,” “The world’s best way to buy glasses,” and “The world’s best way to buy contacts,” the Eyeglass World mast image Mr. World, AC Lens, FirstSight, Vista Optical, Eyecare Club, Sofmed, Digimax, Neverglare, Neverglare Advantage and Neverglare Advantage & design. Solely for convenience, the trademarks, service marks and tradenames referred to in this report are presented without the ®, SM and ™ symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the rights of the applicable licensors to these trademarks, service marks and tradenames. All trademarks, service marks and tradenames appearing in this Form 10-K (or in documents we have incorporated by reference) are the property of their respective owners.
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations. Because of the various facets of our business, the scope and extent of laws and regulations applicable to our business are always subject to the risk of change or material increase. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations can subject us to sanctions (including suspension and loss of operating licenses), fines or various forms of civil or criminal prosecution, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See Part I. Item 1A. “Risk Factors” below for a discussion of these and other risks. A summary of certain laws and regulations is described below.
Corporate Practice of Medicine/Optometry and Similar Laws
Many states prohibit the corporate practice of medicine/optometry where a business corporation practices medicine or employs a physician to provide professional medical services. Many states interpret the corporate practice of medicine/optometry rules broadly to prohibit employment of eye care practitioners by corporations like us and to prohibit various financial arrangements, such as fee-splitting, between eye care practitioners and other entities. A number of states that permit these relationships nevertheless regulate them extensively. For example, some states prohibit a common entrance to a retail optical location and an optometric office. These laws and regulations can vary significantly by state, requiring us to tailor our operations in each state to the particular laws of such state. Many of these laws and regulations are 
17

vague and are subject to the interpretation of regulators and enforcement authorities, which may change over time. States periodically revisit these laws and regulations and we are subject to the ongoing risk that the regulatory scheme in any state can change in ways adverse to us. Our America’s Best operations, which feature a bundled offer of eyeglasses and an eye examination, are particularly implicated by these laws. 
Professional Licensure and Regulation
Our operations are also subject to state licensing laws. All states license the practice of ophthalmology and optometry and many states license opticians. The dispensing of prescription eyewear is further regulated in most states in which we do business. In some states, we are also required to register our stores. 
Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act (“FCLCA”)
In connection with our sales of contact lens, we must comply with the FCLCA, and its implementing regulations, which establish a national uniform standard in the United States with regard to releasing and verifying contact lens prescriptions. This law also contains a “passive verification” requirement pursuant to which a prescription is deemed verified if a prescriber fails to respond within eight business hours to a request by a seller for confirmation of the accuracy of the prescription. 
Managed Care Regulation 
We are engaged in managed vision care, both as a managed care entity and as a provider to managed care payors and insurers. In California, our subsidiary, FirstSight, a specialized health maintenance organization (“HMO”), is subject to the managed care laws of the State of California and is licensed and comprehensively regulated by the California Department of Managed Health Care (the “DMHC”). These regulations contain operating, disclosure, reporting, and financial viability requirements, among others. Material changes to the operations of FirstSight, including the opening of America’s Best locations outside of defined service areas, must be approved by the DMHC. This approval process can be complex and can cause delays in the projected opening of our stores. We also offer Eyecare Club programs pursuant to which, in exchange for a fixed payment, individuals can obtain eye examinations and discounts on eyeglasses, contact lenses and accessories during the program period. These programs may be subject to regulation under managed care and related state laws, including those of California, where these programs are offered as managed care products by FirstSight. In addition, our Eyecare Club programs may subject us to state statutes regulating discount medical plans. These laws, which have been adopted in a number of states, require the licensing or registration of organizations that provide discounted access to health care providers. It is possible that state regulators could determine that we are operating as a discount medical plan and as such are subject to the various registration, disclosure and solvency requirements. 
Privacy and Security
We directly collect, use, access, disclose, transmit and/or store protected health information (“PHI”) and personally identifiable information (“PII”) in connection with the sales of our products and services, customer service, billing and employment practices. As a health care provider and as a business associate to health care providers, we are subject to federal and comparable state laws governing privacy and security, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and its implementing regulations, such as the Privacy Rule, the Security Rule and the Breach Notification Rule. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (the “HITECH Act”) extends the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule directly to business associates. We are also subject to comparable state health privacy laws to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than the Privacy Rule. Nearly all states have adopted their own data breach laws with comparable (and sometimes conflicting) standards and requirements. These state laws apply to breaches of specified elements of personal information. 
Laws Related to Reimbursement by Government Programs
Our participation in federal reimbursement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, subjects us to federal anti-kickback, false claims, self-referral and similar laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in exchange for, the referral of an individual or purchasing, furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payment of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have found a violation of the statute’s intent requirement if a single purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered businesses. There are also a number of healthcare fraud statutes that impose criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly 
18

and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the Anti-Kickback Statute or healthcare fraud statutes, or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation. Many states have adopted similar laws that apply to any third-party payors including commercial plans. 
In addition, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute provides that any claim for government reimbursement in violation of the statute also violates the False Claims Act (“FCA”). The FCA prohibits intentionally submitting, conspiring to submit, or causing to be submitted, false or otherwise improper claims, records or statements to the federal government, or intentionally failing to return overpayments, in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs. Most states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the FCA, and both federal and state false claims laws permit private individuals to file qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government. The Social Security Act also imposes significant penalties for false or improper Medicare and Medicaid billings. 
The U.S. Physician Self-Referral Law, or the Stark Law, generally prohibits physicians (which the Stark Law defines to also include optometrists) from referring, for certain services, Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries to any entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship. This law further prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim for reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the prohibited referral. Many states have adopted similar self-referral laws which are not limited to Medicare or Medicaid reimbursed services. In some cases, the rental of space constitutes a financial relationship under this law. 
Federal Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Regulation
The FDA generally has authority to, among other things, regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and labeling of medical devices, including contact and spectacle lenses. Under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”), medical devices must meet a number of regulatory requirements. We engage in certain manufacturing, repackaging and relabeling activities at our optical laboratories and at certain Eyeglass World stores, which subject us to the FDA’s registration, listing, and quality requirements. We are required to register our laboratories with the FDA. 
Consumer Protection Laws
Federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations can apply to our operations and retail offers. Some of our promotions, such as our America’s Best offer of a “free” eye exam, are subject to compliance with laws and regulations governing use of this term. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”) to investigate and prosecute practices that are “unfair trade practices,” “deceptive trade practices,” or “unfair methods of competition.” State attorneys general typically have comparable authority and many states permit private plaintiffs to bring actions on the basis of these laws. In addition, state regulators or boards of optometry may challenge our promotional practices, including America’s Best’s bundled offers, as, among other things, violating applicable state laws regarding unfair competition or false advertising to consumers. 
E-commerce Laws
Our e-commerce business, operated by our subsidiary AC Lens, must comply with various federal and state laws, most notably the FCLCA, and its implementing regulation, the Contact Lens Rule, adopted by the FTC. This law and Rule require that, before we sell contact lenses online, we verify the prescriptions we receive from our customers. A violation of the Contact Lens Rule constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the FTC Act. Our online business must also be registered in various states. Our international sales online can also implicate other laws, particularly the requirements under the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), which prohibit us from engaging in transactions with certain individuals and companies designated by OFAC. In addition, although we do not have material online sales to the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union, which will be effective in May 2018, will apply to these transactions.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”)
We source a significant portion of our products from outside the United States. The FCPA and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or offering anything of value to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies and our code of conduct mandate compliance with applicable law, including these laws and regulations. 
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI Standard”)
Because we accept debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to the PCI Standard, which contains compliance guidelines with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of 
19

cardholder data. Certain states have incorporated these requirements into state law. Our credit card agreements with our banks require that we comply with this standard and pay for any fines and assessments imposed by the credit card companies in the event of a compromise of card data. 
Service Contract Regulations 
We offer product protection plans for our eyeglasses; in certain states, service contract and similar laws regulate these plans. These laws, which vary by state, mandate that sellers of such contracts comply with various registration, disclosure and financial requirements. It is possible that regulators in certain states could determine that our extended warranty plans should be subject to these laws. 
Environmental and Safety Regulation
Our optical laboratories in the United States and our in-store laboratories in our Eyeglass World locations subject us to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment, public health and employee safety, including, for example, regulations governing the management of hazardous substances, and the maintenance of safe working conditions. These laws also apply generally to all our properties. Our failure to comply with these laws can subject us to criminal and civil liabilities.
Insurance and Risk Management
We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for workers’ compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers’ liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health-care benefits, among others. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Where we have retained risk through self-insurance or similar arrangements, we utilize third-party firms to assist management in assessing the financial impact of risk retention.
