ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are an emerging medical device company developing a nitric oxide (NO) delivery system, or the AIT NO Delivery System, that is capable of generating NO from ambient air.  The AIT NO Delivery System can generate up to 400 parts per million (ppm) for delivery to a patient’s lung.  The AIT NO Delivery System can deliver NO either continuously or for a fixed amount of time and has the ability to either titrate dose on demand or maintain a constant dose.  We believe that there is a high unmet medical need for patients suffering from certain severe lung infections for which our system can be used.  Our current product candidates, if approved, will be marketed as medical devices and will be subject to premarket reviews and approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA.
 
In contrast to approved NO delivery systems, our novel AIT NO Delivery System is designed to deliver not only low concentrations of NO, but also high concentrations of NO to the lungs, which we believe has the potential to eliminate microbial infections, including bacteria, fungi and viruses. Current FDA approved NO delivery systems are approved for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, or PPHN, which requires a NO concentration of 20 ppm and is not intended to treat microbial infections. The body produces NO naturally as an innate immunity mechanism. Based on our clinical studies, we believe that 160 ppm is the minimum therapeutic dose to achieve the desired pulmonary antimicrobial effect of NO. To date, the FDA has not approved any NO formulation and/or delivery system for the delivery of 160 ppm or higher to the lungs.
 
We were incorporated in Delaware on April 28, 2015 under the name “KokiCare, Inc.” and operated as a healthcare software company prior to the Merger (as defined below). Concurrent with the closing of the Merger, we abandoned our pre-Merger business plan in the healthcare software industry and we are now solely pursuing our business in the medical device industry, which we conduct, almost exclusively, through our wholly-owned Israeli subsidiary, AIT Ltd. AIT Ltd. was incorporated in Rehovot, Israel, under the laws of the State of Israel on May 1, 2011.
 
The Merger and Reverse Acquisition
 
On December 29, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, which, as amended, we refer to as the Merger Agreement, together with Red Maple Ltd., or Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of KokiCare, Inc., , and Advanced Inhalation Therapies (AIT) Ltd., or AIT Ltd. The Merger Agreement provided for (i) the merger of Merger Sub with and into AIT Ltd. pursuant to the laws of the State of Israel, referred to as the Israeli Merger, and (ii) the conversion of the ordinary shares and other outstanding securities of AIT Ltd. into the right to receive shares and other applicable securities of KokiCare, Inc., with AIT Ltd. surviving as our wholly owned subsidiary, which we refer to as the Merger. The Israeli Merger became effective on December 29, 2016 and the Merger closed on January 13, 2017.
 
Prior to consummation of the Merger, effective as of January 9, 2017, we amended and restated our Certificate of Incorporation to (i) change our name from “KokiCare, Inc.” to “AIT Therapeutics, Inc.”, (ii) increase our capitalization to provide for the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share; and (iii) effect a one-for-100 reverse stock split of our common stock. On January 9, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a $2.50 per share cash dividend to our stockholders of record as of January 9, 2017, and we repurchased 90,000 shares of common stock (on a post-reverse stock split basis) at a price of $0.2667 per share from our principal stockholder, Jason Lane.
 
The Merger was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization. AIT Ltd. is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes, and we are the acquired company.
 
Unless otherwise indicated, all information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to periods prior to the date on which we consummated the Merger relates solely to Kokicare, Inc., without regard to the Merger.

Business Overview
 
We are an emerging medical device company developing our AIT NO Delivery System, which is capable of generating NO from ambient air.  The AIT NO Delivery System can generate NO up to 400 ppm for delivery to a patient’s lung. The AIT NO Delivery System can deliver NO either continuously or for a fixed amount of time and has the ability to either titrate dose on demand or maintain a constant dose. We believe the AIT NO System can be used to treat patients on a ventilator that require NO, as well as patients with chronic lung disease or acute severe lung infections via delivery through a breathing mask.  Furthermore, we believe that there is a high unmet medical need for patients suffering from certain severe lung infections that our AIT NO Delivery System can potentially address.  Our initial areas of focus are PPHN, bronchiolitis and nontuberculous mycobacteria, or NTM,. Our current product candidates, if approved, will be marketed as medical devices and will be subject to premarket reviews and approvals by the FDA.
 
With respect to PPHN, our novel AIT NO Delivery System is designed to deliver a dosage of NO to the lungs that is consistent with current guidelines for delivery of 20 ppm NO with a range of 0.5 ppm – 80 ppm (low-concentration NO).  We believe our AIT NO Delivery System has many competitive advantages over the current approved NO delivery systems in the United States, European Union, Japan and other markets.  For example, our AIT NO Delivery System does not require the use of a high-pressure cylinder, utilizes less space than other similar devices, does not require cumbersome purging procedures and places less burden on hospital staff in carrying out safety procedures.
 
Our novel AIT NO Delivery System can also deliver a high dosage of NO to the lungs, which we believe has the potential to eliminate microbial infections, including bacteria, fungi and viruses.  We believe current FDA approved NO vasodilation treatments would have limited success in treating microbial infections given the low concentrations of NO being delivered . Given that NO is produced naturally by the body as an innate immunity mechanism at a concentration of 200 ppm, supplemental high dose NO should aid in the body’s fight against infection.  Based on our clinical studies, we believe that 160 ppm is the minimum therapeutic dose to achieve the desired pulmonary antimicrobial effect of NO. To date, the FDA has not approved any NO formulation and/or delivery system for the delivery of a dosage of 160 ppm or higher to the lungs.
 
To date, we have conducted the following studies:

Our active pipeline of product candidates is shown in the table below:
 
 
Product | Indication | Development Status | Further Information 
--------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------
AIT-PH (Pulmonary Hypertension) | In-Hospital Use | Commercial system in development | Regulatory filings expected ~year end 2018 
AIT-BRO (Bronchiolitis) | Bronchiolitis in Infants (elderly to follow) | 94 patient study ongoing | Data expected in 2Q18 
AIT-NTM (Nontuberculous Mycobacteria) | Mycobacterium Abscessus Complex (MABSC) | 9 patient pilot study dosing complete | Meet with FDA by mid-year to discuss potential pivotal trial design



We plan to submit a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the use of AIT NO Delivery System in PPHN. We also expect to make certain regulatory filings outside of the United States beginning in 2019.  According to the year end report from Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, aggregate sales of low concentration NO in the United States was $505 million in 2017.  Sales outside of the United States are considerably lower than the US figure.
 
With respect to bronchiolitis, we expect to initiate a pivotal trial for infants hospitalized due to bronchiolitis in the fourth quarter of 2018 or the fourth quarter of 2019 depending on our ability, along with clinical trial sites, to adequately prepare for the 2018 start.  The trial would last approximately 6 months after initiation. If the trial is successful, we would submit a premarket approval or PMA to the FDA about 6 months after trial completion.  Regulatory filings outside of the United States would begin after our review process is completed in the United States.
 
Our NTM program has produced data from three compassionate use subjects and patients form a multi-center pilot study completed earlier this year.  All patients suffered from NTM Abscessus infection and had underlying cystic fibrosis (CF).  One compassion patient was treated with our NO generator based delivery system at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).  The rest were treated with our NO cylinder based delivery system at 160 ppm NO for with intermittent 30 minute dosing over 21 days.  We expect to meet with the FDA during the second quarter of 2018 to discuss a pivotal trial design for the use of the AIT NO Delivery System (generator based) for patient suffering from the effects of NTM and potentially other serious, chronic, refractory lung infections.
 
For our high concentration platform, the initial target  is lower respiratory tract infections, or LRTI. Our initial two target indications, infants hospitalized due to bronchiolitis (mainly caused by RSV) and patients suffering from NTM abscessus and other severe, chronic, refractory infections. There are over 1.5 million hospitalizations related to LRTI annually in the United States, and LRTI is the third leading cause of death worldwide.
 
NTM abscessus lung infection is a rare and serious pulmonary disease associated with increased morbidity and mortality. There is an increasing rate of lung disease caused by NTM, which is an emerging public health concern worldwide. There are approximately 50,000 patients diagnosed with NTM in the United States, and there are an estimated additional 100,000 patients in the United States that have not yet been diagnosed.  In Asia, the number of patients suffering from NTM surpasses what is seen in the United States.  The abscessus form of NTM comprises approximately 25% of all NTM.

Patients with NTM lung disease may experience a multitude of symptoms such as fever, weight loss, cough, lack of appetite, night sweats, blood in the sputum and fatigue. Patients with NTM lung disease, specifically abscessus, frequently require lengthy and repeated hospital stays to manage their condition. There are no treatments specifically indicated for the treatment of NTM lung disease in North America, Europe or Japan. Current guideline-based approaches to treat NTM lung disease involve multi-drug regimens of anti-biotics that may cause severe, long lasting side effects, and treatment can be as long as two years or more. The prevalence of human disease attributable to NTM has increased over the past two decades. In a study conducted between 1997 and 2007, researchers found that the prevalence of NTM in the United States is increasing at approximately 8% per year and that NTM patients on Medicare over the age of 65 are 40% more likely to die over the period of the study than those who did not have the disease (Adjemian et al., 2012). A 2015 publication from co-authors from several U.S. government departments stated that prior year statistics led to a projected 181,037 national annual cases in 2014 costing the U.S. healthcare system approximately $1.7 billion (Strollo et al., 2015).
 
Over 150 million new cases of bronchiolitis are reported worldwide each year. In the United States, there are more than 100,000 annual bronchiolitis hospitalizations among children two years of age or younger.
 
Currently, there is no approved treatment for bronchiolitis. The treatment for acute viral lung infections that cause bronchiolitis in infants is largely supportive care, and is based primarily on prolonged hospitalization during which the infant receives a constant flow of oxygen to treat hypoxemia, a reduced concentration of oxygen in the blood. In addition, systemic steroids and inhalation with bronchodilators are sometimes utilized until recovery, but we believe these treatments do not successfully eliminate microbes and reduce hospital length of stay.
 
We believe, based on the currently understood mechanisms of action of NO, that our AIT NO Delivery System can deliver NO at 160 ppm and higher to potentially eliminate bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microbes from the lungs and may also be effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  Because our product candidates are not antibiotics, we believe there is a reduced risk of the development of resistant bacteria and there could be synergy with co-administration of antibiotics. In addition, our NO Delivery System can deliver NO at concentrations of 1 – 80 ppm consistent with currently approved NO delivery systems for the treatment of PPHN while providing significant advantges associated with the elimination of the use of high-pressure cylinders.
 
We have a broad intellectual property portfolio directed to our product candidates and mode of delivery, monitoring parameters and methods of treating specific disease indications. Our intellectual property portfolio consists of seven issued patents and their continuations and foreign counterparts, which we have obtained through a non-exclusive worldwide license from SensorMedics Corporation, a subsidiary of CareFusion, 17 issued patents which we acquired pursuant to the exercise of an option in 2017 granted to us by Pulmonox Technologies Corporation (“Pulmonox”) and 22 patent applications developed by us internally. Eight of the Pulmonox patents that we acquired are jointly owned by CareFusion and Pulmonox, five of which are covered by our non-exclusive license with CareFusion. Our royalty and other license obligations to CareFusion with respect to these five patents will remain in effect as long as our CareFusion license remains in effect.  In January 2018, we entered into a global, exclusive, transferable license to the eNOGenerator and all associated patents from NitricGen, Inc., or NitricGen.
 
Background and Mechanism of Action
 
NO is recognized as a vital molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. NO is naturally produced by the body’s immune system to provide a first line of defense against invading pathogens. It is a powerful molecule with a short half-life of a few seconds in the blood, enabling it to be cleared rapidly from the body. NO has been shown to play a critical role in the function of several body systems. For example, as vasodilator of smooth muscles, NO enhances blood flow and circulation. In addition, NO is involved in regulation of a wound healing and immune responses to infection. The pharmacology, toxicity and other data for NO in humans is generally well known, and its use has been approved by the FDA as a vasodilator. The precise effect of inhaled NO is dependent on concentration, oxidation state and type of pathogen.
 
 7
 
NO has multiple immunoregulatory and antimicrobial functions that are likely to be of relevance to inhaled NO therapy. In vitro studies suggest that NO possesses anti-microbial activity against common bacteria, gram positive and gram negative, as well as mycobacteria, fungi, yeast, parasites and helminthes. It has the potential to eliminate multi-drug resistant strains of the above. Anti-viral activity covers respiratory viruses such as influenza, corona viruses, RSV and others. In healthy humans, NO has been shown to stimulate muccocilary clearance, and low levels of nasal NO correlate with impaired muccociliary function in the human upper airway. Unlike other inhaled drugs, NO is also a smooth muscle relaxant and avoids the concomitant bronchial constriction often associated with inhaled antibiotics and muccolytics. In addition to treating CF infections, this suggests that NO may be useful in directly treating the mucus caused by CF, which is the principal manifestation of the disease.
 
Nitric Oxide and Infection
 
NO possesses broad-spectrum anti-microbial activity acting against bacteria, fungi and viruses. NO is produced at high output as part of the innate immune response. NO and its by-products (for example, reactive nitrogen species, or RNS) are responsible for the process of killing microorganisms within white blood cells called macrophages and in organs such as the lungs and other mucolytic tissues.
 
More than a decade ago, several research groups showed that NO and RNS possess anti-viral activity and affect several viruses including coxsackievirus, or CVB, RSV, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, coronavirus, rhinovirus, herpes simplex virus, or HSV, Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV, and others. NO has also been shown to be useful in preventing bacterial growth on surfaces.
 
Continuous exposure to 160 ppm NO and above, especially in the lungs, may have side effects and cause damage to host cells. Intermittent exposure to NO in cycles retains NO anti-microbial activity both in vitro and in animal model of infection. Exposure of bacteria to concomitant 30-minute treatments with 160 ppm NO resulted in a significant reduction in bacterial load. A similar dose has been shown to reduce viruses (common influenza) by 30-100% in a canine kidney infection model. In vivo, in a pneumonia model in rats, inhaled 160 ppm NO, for 30 minutes, every 4 hours, resulted in significant reduction in bacteria counts in the lungs, without affecting the body’s defense mechanisms, and without any other adverse effect. In addition, we believe a daily dose of 160 ppm of NO can treat bovine respiratory disease (“BRD”) in cattle.
 
Importantly, several studies report synergy between NO and antibiotic drugs. Adjunctive treatment combining NO together with inhaled tobramycin antibiotics or other anti-microbial agents has been shown to greatly enhance the efficacy of the antibiotics in dispersing P. aeruginosa biofilms and to increase their ability to elicit anti-microbial activity. These studies suggest that adjuvant treatment combining NO with antibiotics might have a beneficial role by reducing bacterial infectivity, and therefore reduce the dependency on antibiotics.
 
AIT Technology
 
We have developed the AIT NO Delivery System, a novel and precise delivery system that uses NO generated from ambient air with a novel NO generator. We believe our system provides continuous monitoring and control of the gaseous content administered during intermittent and continuous NO inhalation treatments, as well as a precise and reliable monitoring system that is able to monitor patient status and alert medical staff to any adverse effects.
 
Our novel AIT NO Delivery System is designed to provide patients with a gaseous dose of NO (ranging from 1 ppm up to 400 ppm) combined with ambient air.  The gaseous blend is supplied to the patient via a ventilator for concentrations up to 80 ppm and a face mask for concentrations of 160 ppm and higher.  Our AIT NO Delivery System is designed to minimize the time that NO is mixed with oxygen and air. The system is also designed to continuously monitor inhaled NO concentration, NO 2 concentration, methemoglobin and the fraction of inspired oxygen, or FiO 2, blood oxygen saturation and heart rate, all of which are important parameters . A dedicated screen allows for monitoring of the gas mixture and the patient’s vital signs. Further, our product candidates resemble other inhalation systems, making it user friendly, with operation and maintenance that we believe will be familiar to medical staff. Our novel delivery system for use with a mask has been manufactured at commercial scale with a contract manufacturer.

Our novel NO delivery system, when programmed for lung infections, is designed to specifically deliver a NO dosage of 160 ppm and higher, and we believe that it has a number of advantages over other NO formulation delivery systems. For example, it is:
 
 
· | optimized to deliver 160 ppm and higher of NO, whereas existing formulations of NO currently on the market consist of a maximum deliverable NO concentration of 80 ppm;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | equipped with a monitoring system that continuously monitors system parameters (e.g., NO, NO2 and FiO2 concentrations) as well as patient parameters (e.g. vital signs, MetHemoglobin and OxyHemoglobin percentages);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | capable of providing constant flow of our NO formulation, which we believe allows it to adequately cover the surface area of the lung to eliminate bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microbes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | programmable and able to deliver different dosage regimens for a wide range of lung infections;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | able to generate NO from ambient air, eliminating the need for the use of high-pressure cylinders;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | designed to be used by the patient, thus convenient and portable; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | administered non-invasively through a facial mask, which has the potential to address large, underserved chronic-care markets, such as CF.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We believe that our solution has the potential for a number of additional benefits and opportunities, as follows:
 
 
· | The antimicrobial and multiple other properties of the NO molecule delivered to the lungs suggest the potential for application in a wide range of respiratory diseases. In contrast to the often arduous and slow drug discovery process for small molecules, proteins, peptides, etc., the use of NO in medicine is well-known, and therefore the identification of conditions where NO provides benefits has been, and we expect will continue to be, much simpler, quicker and less costly.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The FDA approved the use of an NO formulation as an inhaled drug for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in newborns in 1999. More than 18 years of clinical experience in the delivery, monitoring and understanding of NO in the clinical environment for vascular uses has been documented.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NO is naturally produced by the immune system and acts as a first line of defense against infectious diseases. We believe therapeutic use of NO for viral and bacterial co-infections would potentially improve the success of antimicrobial and anti-viral treatments by mimicking the body’s natural defense mechanism and thereby directly reduce viral infectivity, as well as antibiotic drug resistant bacteria.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NO is used naturally by the body for vasodilation and we believe that the benefits to patients with various medical conditions will be seen via vasodilation when delivered with our system
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



NitricGen License
 
On January 31, 2018 we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a global, exclusive, transferable license to the eNOGenerator and associated critical assets including intellectual property, know-how, trade secrets and confidential information (the “License”) from NitricGen.
 
The AIT NO delivery system, which incorporates the eNOGenerator, has been designated as a medical device by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The eNOGenerator can generate NO on demand for delivery to the lungs at concentrations ranging from 1 to 400 ppm. With the License, we expect that we will be able to target all conditions requiring NO at any concentration, regardless of the need for intermittent or continuous dosing.
 
Under the terms of the License, we agree to pay NitricGen an aggregate of $2 million in up-front, clinical, and regulatory milestone payments, with the majority pertaining to regulatory milestones, as well as royalties on net sales of the delivery system containing the eNOGenerator at a percentage in the low-single digits. As partial consideration for the License, we have also agreed to issue to NitricGen or its designees options to purchase 100,000 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $6.90.

Strategies
 
Our objective is to build a leading medical device company that will develop and commercialize patented and proprietary products for the treatment of respiratory infections and diseases, with an initial focus on the treatment of PPHN, bronchiolitis, severe lung infections such as NTM, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, and CF.  If our clinical trials for our product candidates are successful, we expect to seek marketing approval from the FDA and other worldwide regulatory bodies.
 
Our completed clinical trials and plans for future clinical trials are as follows:
 
 
· | We licensed Phase 1 study results in healthy volunteers from University of British Columbia Hospital, or UBC. Results showed safe delivery of 160 ppm NO to the lung. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Bronchiolitis. We completed a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled pilot study conducted in Israel in infants with bronchiolitis. We commenced an Israeli-based clinical trial in the first quarter of 2017 that will complete in the second quarter of 2018 which will serve as another pilot study. We intend to submit an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) to the FDA in 2018 and expect to commence a pivotal clinical trial in 2018 or 2019 in the United States. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NTM. Three patients with CF who suffer from NTM infections (specifically, M. Abscessus) have been treated under compassionate use, comprising two patients at the Rambam healthcare campus in Israel and one patient in the United States, treated with our AIT generator based NO Delivery System, at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). A pilot study of nine CF patients infected with NTM Abscessus in Israel were treated with our AIT NO Delivery System using cylinder gas was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, we intend to speak with the FDA in 2018 to get agreement on a pivotal trial design. We expect that the pivotal study will use our generator based NO delivery system and treat patients infected with NTM and other severe, refractory lung infections with and without CF. Endpoints are expected to include 6-minute walk, bacterial load, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), quality of life and safety. The study is anticipated to commence in 2019.

· | CF-Related Lung Infections. We completed a pilot open label, multi-center study in Israel of CF patients who are over 10 years old. Results showed a reduction in bacterial load in multiple infections.

Our Initial Disease Targets and Market Opportunity
 
Our initial targets are PPHN, infants suffering from bronchiolitis and patients infected by NTM Abscessus.
 
PPHN is a condition at birth that requires mechanical ventilation.  NO is added as a vasodilator to improve oxygenation and reduce the need for ventilation in neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure.  The use of NO in the hospital setting had associated net sales of $505m in 2018 according to published reports.
 
According to the World Health Organization, bronchiolitis is the most common acute lower respiratory infection in infants, and is the leading cause of the hospitalization of infants during the first year of life. Bronchiolitis is an acute inflammatory injury of the bronchioles that is usually caused by viruses, most commonly by RSV. While bronchiolitis may affect persons of any age, severe symptoms are usually evident only in young infants. The initial symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to that of a common cold, but the illness sometimes leads to fast and troubled breathing due to spread of the infection to the lower respiratory system. To date, the standard treatment has been supportive care consisting of assisted feeding and hydration, minimal handling, nasal suctioning and oxygen administration. In addition, better airway cleaning, which improves the respiratory function, has been achieved using nebulized hypertonic saline. We believe that many pharmacological therapies, ranging from bronchodilators to corticosteroids, have been found to offer either no or short-term benefits.
 
Each year, according to the World Health Organization, 150 million new cases of bronchiolitis are reported worldwide in infants, and 2-3% of infants affected require hospitalization. In the United States, there are greater than 100,000 annual bronchiolitis hospitalizations among children younger than five years, of which 115,000 hospitalizations are among children younger than one year old. These hospital visits resulted in total hospital charges of $1.7 billion in 2009 according to a study published in 2013. For infants, bronchiolitis accounts for 20% of annual hospitalizations and 18% of emergency department visits.
 
 10
 
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, in 2009, almost 3,000 children in the United States with bronchiolitis needed mechanical ventilation, and the average length of hospital stay for previously healthy infants was 2.5 days. The mortality in children less than one year of age was 0.25%. In 2009, the total direct cost of bronchiolitis related hospitalization was $545 million.
 
Clinical practice in the management of acute bronchiolitis varies widely even among medical centers in the same country, and there is much controversy, confusion and lack of evidence concerning the best treatment option. Disease management mainly consists of supportive care by means of oxygen supplementation, but also includes inhalations of hypertonic saline or steroids with or without beta agonist drugs, anti-viral therapy and chest physiotherapy.
 
We believe that none of the specified treatments has been proven to have a positive outcome on the course of the disease or a reduction in the length of hospitalization. In addition, some treatment strategies have been subject to debate regarding whether they work. For example, the anti-viral drug, Ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent approved for treatment of RSV infections, is controversial due to questions regarding its high cost and uncertain treatment effect.
 
NTM infection of the lungs is a chronic, as well as progressive lung condition. NTM exhibits across a variety of lung diseases such as bronchiectasis, COPD, Asthma, CF, HIV and Cancer. In certain severe NTM cases, life expectancy is under five years, for which we believe there are no successful treatments available.
 
There are an estimated 50,000-86,000 cases of NTM lung infections in the United States with an annual 8% increase. More than 70% of NTM cases are underreported, and therefore the projected number of NTM cases could be as high as 181,000 in the United States alone. With the rise of NTM infections, NTM is currently more prevalent than tuberculosis in the United States. NTM mostly affects adults middle-aged to elderly, with increasing infection in patients aged 65 and over, a population that is expected to double by the year 2030.
 
NTM lung infections also pose a substantial financial burden on the U.S. healthcare system. In 2010, the annual cost was over $800 million, and the same study estimated the cost for 2014 to be $1.7 billion in the United States.
 
Our initial indication is for the treatment of NTM Abscessus, which is a limited portion of the market discussed above.
 
There are no approved products in the United States and Europe to treat NTM infections.
 
For NTM patients, prolonged treatment is necessary and varies among different types of NTM species, severity of the disease and drug-susceptibility. As NTM are typically antibiotic-resistant, treatment requires a combination of two to three different drugs. Therefore, current treatment includes a mixture of IV antibiotics as well as steroids.
 
Our Clinical Results to Date
 
We have conducted several clinical trials to assess our 160 ppm NO inhalation-treatment in various indications. These trials include:
 
A prospective, open label, controlled, single-center Phase 1 study was conducted on ten healthy adults between 20 and 62 years of age. Subjects received our proprietary 160 ppm NO formulation for 30 minutes, five times a day, for five consecutive days by direct inhalation to the lungs via a prototype delivery system. The study was performed at the UBC, and was published in 2012 in the Journal of Cystic Fibrosis.
 
The primary objective of the study was to determine the effect of the inhaled NO formulation treatment, to determine the effect of the treatment based on pulmonary function test results, to determine the met hemoglobin (MetHb - a form of hemoglobin that cannot bind oxygen, a bi-product of NO and hemoglobin) level associated with the inhaled NO formulation treatment and to assess adverse events associated with the treatment. Secondary objectives of the study were to assess the changes in cytokine levels. NO and NO2 concentrations (a gaseous substance that is a bi-product of NO and O 2, that can be toxic at high concentrations), inhaled fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), as well as. MetHb and oxygen saturation (SaO2) were continuously monitored, as elevation of MetHb or reduction in SaO 2 levels may be harmful. Vital signs, lung function, blood chemistry (including nitrite/nitrates), hematology, prothrombin time, inflammatory cytokine/chemokines levels and endothelial activation (angiopoietin ratio) were also closely monitored.

All individuals tolerated the NO formulation treatment courses well. No significant adverse events occurred. The maximal amount of air one can forcefully exhale in one second, known as forced expiratory volume in one second (“FEV1”) and other lung function parameters, serum nitrites/nitrates, prothrombin, pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels did not differ between baseline and day five, while MetHb increased during the study period to a level of 0.9%, as expected. These data suggest that inhalation of 160 ppm NO for 30 minutes, five times a day, for five consecutive days is well tolerated in healthy individuals.
 
Rambam healthcare campus in Israel conducted a compassionate use treatment for two patients with CF who suffer from NTM Abscessus infections.  The data were published in the Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal in 2017.  The NO treatment regime, as well as the device for this treatment, were supplied by AIT Ltd. Patients received intermittent 30-minute treatments of 160 ppm NO, with two different regimes including hospitalization (5 times a day) and ambulatory treatment (2-3 inhalations a day).
 
Treatment was well tolerated with no evidence of any serious side effects. We observed significant improvement in sputum production (up to 5-10 time more sputum), and subjective improvement in the well-being of both patients.
 
Significant reduction in systemic inflammation was observed in the first patient, as observed by reduction of CRP (C-reactive protein, a systemic inflammation marker that rises in response to inflammation) levels during treatment. In addition, the first patient had a 2 log (100-fold) reduction in NTM Abscessus during treatment (an effect that was lost after the treatment regime changed to ambulatory). The second patient showed a significant increase in the 6-minute walk test and the sputum culture became negative, which is consistent with eradication of the NTM Abscessus.
 
Further information is needed, but we believe these results suggest that the treatment of NTM Abcsessus with high dose inhaled NO is effective.
 
Further, one patient with CF who suffers from NTM infections (specifically, M. Abscessus) has been treated under compassionate use in the United Sates at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute with our generator based NO delivery system.  The patient saw improvements in 6-minute walk, FEV1, most Quality of Life measures and had no SAEs.  The bacteria was not eradicated.  The patient requested to be treated again and this treatment was commenced in February 2018.  A total of 38 treatments were administered over 8 days, 29 of them at a concentration of 240 ppm, with no SAEs related to NO reported.  We are awaiting further evaluation at this time and may treat the patient again in the near future.
 
We have completed a Phase 2 open label, multi-center study in nine CF patients (≥10 years old). Patients received intermittent (30 minutes, three times a day) inhalation of 160 ppm NO formulation, five days a week, over a two-week period. The study was performed in two centers, Soroka Medical Center and Schneider Children’s Medical Center of Israel.
 
The primary endpoints of the study were to determine the MetHb percentage, adverse events associated with inhaled NO and the percentage of subjects who prematurely discontinued the study due to adverse events, or AEs, and/or SAEs, or for any other reason.
 
AEs were reported by five (55.5%) subjects. There were no SAEs or AEs, no treatment withdrawals due to AEs, and no deaths. AEs considered by the investigator as possibly or probably related to treatment were reported for two (22.2%) subjects. There were no AEs of MetHb elevation >5% or NO2 elevation >5 ppm (study safety threshold of MetHb and NO2, respectively). In total, seven cases of haemoptysis were reported in two subjects and all events were mild in severity.
 
 12
 
There were no subjects with MetHb >5% at any point during the study and there was no cumulative effect of MetHb exposure during the study. The maximum MetHb level reported was 4.6%.
 
Several secondary efficacy analyses were conducted in this study, and though the study was not powered for efficacy, results show various positive effects of the treatment regime. Bacterial and fungal sputum load analysis results were highly variable, though marked reductions of MSSA, Achromabacter, P. aeruginosa, and Asperigillus were seen in several subjects. These results suggest non-specific targeting of bacteria and fungi that commonly manifest in CF patients. In subjects with systemic inflammation (CRP >5 mg/mL) at baseline, CRP levels decreased over the treatment period, showing the effect of NO in the reduction of systemic inflammation. There were no statistically significant or clinically relevant changes in FEV1 over time, and lung function indices also remained relatively constant throughout the study duration.
 
We completed a double blind, randomized Pilot study for infants with bronchiolitis. The study was performed at Soroka University Medical Center in Israel. Forty-three infants between the ages of two to 12 months diagnosed with bronchiolitis were randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the control group. The treatment group comprised 21 subjects who received intermittent (30 minutes, five times a day) inhalation of 160 ppm NO formulation, in addition to supportive O2 treatment for up to five days. The control group, 22 subjects, received ongoing inhalation of the supportive O2 treatment.
 
Primary endpoints included determination of the MetHb levels, adverse events associated with the inhaled NO formulation and proportion of subjects who prematurely discontinued the study. Baseline clinical score, indicating disease severity at screening, was similar between treatment groups (~8).
 
Results were encouraging, with similar overall incidence of AEs between the treatment groups. Out of 43 patients, 39 (~90%) completed the study per protocol (“PP”), with similar percentages (90%) for both the control and the treatment groups, individually. Only one subject from the treatment group discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, namely – repeated MetHb levels above 5%. Adverse events were reported by 23 (53.5%) subjects overall, with ten (47.6%) subjects in the NO group reporting a total of 22 AEs, and 13 (59.1%) subjects in the control group reporting a total of 22 AEs. Serious adverse events were reported by four (19.0%) subjects in the NO group and four (18.2%) in the standard treatment group. There were no deaths during the study. There were no treatment-related SAEs in the NO treatment group.
 
In the NO group, six (28.6%) subjects had any MetHb measurement >5% during the study treatment period, and three of these subjects had more than one MetHb >5%. The maximum MetHb level was 5.6% in one subject in the NO group. There was no cumulative effect of MetHb exposure during the study. It should be noted that MetHb levels in this study were defined to <5% as a safety measure, though previous findings have shown that higher levels (6.4%) are non-toxic in children.
 
Secondary and exploratory analyses were performed, and results show positive impact of the treatment regime. In a subgroup of subjects that stayed at the hospital at least 24 hours (Length of Stay (“LOS”) >24 hours), a statistically significant treatment benefit of NO versus standard treatment was demonstrated. Mean results for subjects with LOS > 24 hours show that LOS was shortened by approximately 34% in the NO group compared to the standard treatment group, with a one-day difference between the groups (PP, N=24). Time to normal oxygenation ((SaO2 of 92%) was shortened by approximately 44% (27.75 hours) in the NO group compared to the standard treatment group (PP, N=24). An 80% improvement in time to clinical score (indicating improvement in disease severity) and time to normal oxygenation (92%) was observed in favor of the NO group (PP, N=24).The results of preclinical studies and early clinical studies of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical studies. 
 
Furthermore, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may not concur with our assessment of safety and efficacy. Product candidates that have shown promising results in early-stage clinical studies may still suffer significant setbacks in subsequent advanced clinical studies. We do not know whether any Phase 2, Phase 3 or other clinical studies we may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety sufficient to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates. While we believe the results of our Phase 2 trials in bronchiolitis and CF demonstrated improvements in various endpoints and clinical outcomes, the trials were small, and it is likely that the FDA will view them as not statistically or clinically significant because of their size and scope. We must conduct larger clinical trials with statistically significant favorable results or we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates.

We have completed a single-arm, open-label Pilot trial in nine patients with MABSC, who were refractory to standard-of-care. The patients were treated with inhaled NO at a concentration of 160 ppm for 30 minutes, in addition to treatment with standard-of-care. Our inhaled NO treatment was administered intermittently five times per day over a 14-day period, followed by a seven-day period with three treatments per day. The primary endpoint of safety, as measured by NO-related SAEs, over the 21-day treatment period was met with no SAEs reported. Secondary endpoints of a 6-minute walk test, FEV1, Quality of Life and Mycobacterium abscessus load in sputum all trended positively.  6MW showed an increase of >40 meters at the end of treatment at day 21 versus baseline and an increase of >25 meters on day 81 (60 days after the cessation of therapy).  The mean percentage change in FEV1 at day 21 and day 51 (30 days after the cessation of treatment) was > 3.5% with FEV1 returning to baseline at day 81 (60 days after the cessation of therapy).  At day 81 (60 days after the cessation of therapy) bacterial load was 65% lower than baseline.  1 of 9 patients saw culture conversion.
 
The prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled Phase 3 trial is expected to enroll 94 patients, aged 0-12 months, who are hospitalized due to bronchiolitis.  The patients will receive either standard-of-care (typically oxygen and hydration) or standard-of-care plus inhaled NO at a concentration of 160 ppm for 30 minutes 5 times per day for up to 5 days.  The primary endpoint is hospital length-of-stay (LOS).  Secondary endpoints are time required to achieve a clinical score of 5 or less on the modified Tal score and time required to achieve oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 92% or greater.  We expect to announce data from the trial in the second quarter of 2018.
 
We plan to seek regulatory approval for our current product candidates and, if approved, we expect they will be marketed as medical devices.
 
If we reach the commercialization stage, we expect that we will collaborate with companies outside the United States for all indications and inside the United States for pulmonary hypertension, specifically.  We are still determining whether to attempt to collaborate for bronchiolitis and/or NTM in the United States.
 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, medical device companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our product candidates. We are aware of several companies currently developing and selling NO therapies for various indications such as pulmonary hypertension. For example Mallinkrodt commercializes INOMAX® (nitric oxide) for inhalation, which is approved for use to treat newborns suffering from HRF-PPHN, in the United States, Canada, Australia, Mexico and Japan. The Linde Group has marketing rights to INOMAX® in Europe. Air Liquide sells a similar product in Europe, called VasoKINOX™, together with their delivery platform called OptiKINOX™, for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension that occurs during or after heart surgery. In Europe, Bedfont Scientific Ltd. has a delivery system called NOxBOX® and Air Products PLC has a gas product called NOXAP®, each used in delivering inhaled NO formulations. Bellepheron Therapeutics is developing NO-based products for pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Geno LLC is developing NO-based products for the treatment of a variety of pulmonary and cardiac diseases such as acute vasoreactivity testing, pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, other companies may be developing generic NO formulation delivery systems for various dosages. Ceretec, Inc., a company affiliated with 12th Man Technologies Inc., recently obtained clearance from the FDA to market an NO gas product for use in membrane diffusing capacity testing in pulmonary function laboratories in the United States. Novoteris, LLC previously received orphan drug designation from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for the use of inhaled NO-based treatments in treating CF. If the FDA approves Novoteris’ product candidate for the indication for which it received orphan drug designation, then Novoteris will be eligible for orphan drug exclusivity if its product receives approval first, which would have no effect on our product given we are a medical device. In January 2015, Ikaria entered into an agreement with Novoteris to collaborate on the development of an outpatient program for treating bacterial infections associated with CF. Recently, we have become aware that each of Ikaria and Novoteris is conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial using a 160 ppm NO formulation to treat patients with CF. Moreover, Novoteris is also conducting a Phase 2 study in NTM Abscessus in Canada.

Our competitors, either alone or through their strategic partners, might have substantially greater name recognition and financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and human resources than we do and  greater experience and infrastructure in the research and clinical development of pharmaceutical products, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of those products and commercializing those products around the world.
 
We have contracted with a third party contract manufacturer who has completed a substantial portion of the commercial manufacturing process for our generator based NO delivery system.  We will be reliant on our partner for commercial manufacture of our systems for both clinical studies and commercial supply, if regulatory approval is received.
 
We have patent filings that relate to our NO generator, NO2 filtration, delivery systems and devices configured for delivering NO to patients by inhalation. We also have other patent filings that pertain to methods of exposing patients to inhalation of NO, and to utilizing these methods for treating subjects in need of NO inhalation. In addition, we are in possession of trade secrets and know-how regarding the practice of these methods.
 
Our intellectual property portfolio consists of seven issued patents and one patent application, as well as their continuations and foreign counterparts, which we have obtained through a non-exclusive worldwide license from CareFusion, 17 issued patents that we acquired from Pulmonox and 21 patent applications developed internally, including PCT patent applications.  Additionally, we acquired one issued patent and one patent application in connection with the NitricGen license.
 
CareFusion Non-Exclusive License Agreement. In October 2013, we entered into a non-exclusive worldwide license agreement with CareFusion, whereby we licensed seven issued U.S. patents, and one U.S. patent application, including corresponding foreign counterparts - including patents granted in Australia, Mexico and China. Our intellectual property licensed from CareFusion, for which the earliest expiring patent term is 2019, covers devices and methods for delivering NO formulations to a patient at steady and alternating concentrations, including intermittent delivery of NO. Our CareFusion license also covers patents relating to devices and methods for delivering alternating concentrations of NO topically, nasally and to an upper respiratory tract, for which the expiring patent terms range from 2020 to 2025. The term of the agreement extends through the life of applicable patents and may be terminated by either party with 60 days’ prior written notice in the event of a breach of the agreement, and may be terminated unilaterally by CareFusion with 30 days’ prior written notice in the event that we do not meet certain milestones. Pursuant to the agreement, we are required to pay CareFusion, in addition to a one-time up-front fee of $150,000 already paid, royalty payments of 5% of the net sales of a licensed product by the Company and an annual fee of $50,000, which is creditable against the royalty payments for the respective year.
 
Pulmonox Patents and Assets - Option to Acquire. On August 31, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Pulmonox whereby we acquired for $25,000 the option, referred to as the Option, to purchase certain intellectual property assets, including Pulmonox’s rights in 17 issued U.S. patents, which are directed to: 

· | devices and methods for delivering NO formulations to a patient at steady and alternating concentrations (80-400 ppm), including intermittent delivery of NO;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a device and methods for treatment of surface infections; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | use of NO as a mucolytic agent and for treatment and disinfection of biofilms.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



On January 24, 2017, we exercised the Option and, for a purchase price of $500,000, acquired Pulmonox’s rights in the patents described above. Upon exercise of the Option, we became obligated to make certain one-time development and sales milestone payments to Pulmonox, commencing with the date on which we receive regulatory approval for the commercial sale of our first product candidate.
 
Of the 17 Pulmonox patents, eight U.S. patents are jointly owned by CareFusion and Pulmonox. Pursuant to an agreement with CareFusion, we currently have a non-exclusive world-wide license to five of the eight U.S. patents and their corresponding foreign counterparts jointly owned by CareFusion and Pulmonox, including patents granted in China and Canada, and pending applications in China and Europe. Following the exercise of the option, six patents directed to devices and methods for delivering NO formulations to a patient; one patent directed to systems and methods for using NO to reduce pathogens in blood; one patent directed to use of NO as a mucolytic agent; and one patent directed to methods of using NO for treatment and disinfection of biofilms will be solely owned by us. In addition, four patents directed to devices and methods for delivering NO formulations to a patient at steady and alternating concentrations (80-400 ppm), including intermittent delivery of NO; and four patents directed to a device and methods for treatment of surface infections will be jointly owned by CareFusion and us.
 
 15
 
Patent Applications. We have filed 21 patent applications, including one in Canada, eight in the United States, one in Israel, five in Europe, three PCT patent applications and three provisional patent applications in the United States.
 
A PCT patent application is a filing under the Patent Cooperation Treaty to which the United States and a number of other countries are a party. It provides a unified procedure for filing a single patent application to protect inventions in those countries. A search with respect to the application is conducted by the International Searching Authority, accompanied by a written opinion regarding the patentability of the invention. A PCT application does not itself result in the grant of a patent, and the grant of patent is a prerogative of each national or regional authority where the PCT application is filed during national phase filings.
 
In January 2018 we entered into a definitive agreement with NitricGen which granted us an exclusive global license to one issued patent and one pending patent application covering the NO generator and the NO2 filter.
 
Government Regulations
 
United States Regulation. In the United States, the FDA regulates drug and medical device products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), and its implementing regulations. Our products have been designated devices by FDA and will be regulated by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH).  Given that currently approved NO products and delivery systems were approved in the Unites States as drug-device combinations, we expect our device to not only be reviewed by CDRH, but also have input from the Center for Drug Evaluation and research (CDER).
 
Among other things, we will have to demonstrate compliance with applicable QSRs, to ensure that the device is in compliance with applicable performance standards.
 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to products that are intended to treat rare diseases or conditions (i.e., those affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States). Although orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in the regulatory review and approval process, it can provide certain tax benefits and access to grants. Additionally, FDA user fees, which can be substantial, are waived for products that obtain orphan drug designation. Further, if a product with orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the designated disease or condition, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which (with certain limited exceptions) blocks for seven years FDA approval of another product with the same active ingredient for the same indication.
Approval or Clearance of Medical Devices. To varying degrees, each of the regulatory agencies having oversight over medical devices, including the FDA and comparable foreign regulators, has laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. In the United States, medical device products are subject to regulation that is intended to ensure that the device is either safe and effective or is substantially equivalent to a previously marketed device. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes based on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device. The three classes and the requirements that apply to them are: (i) Class I General Controls, with exemptions and without exemptions, (ii) Class II General Controls and Special Controls, with exemptions and without exemptions and (iii) Class III General Controls and Premarket Marketing authorization. The class to which a device is assigned determines the process that applies for gaining marketing authorization. Most Class I devices are exempt from Premarket Notification 510(k); most Class II devices require Premarket Notification clearance under section 510(k) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and most Class III devices require Premarket Approval.
 
A brief summary overview of the three classifications is set forth below.
 
Exempt Class I Medical Device: Prior to marketing an exempt Class I medical device, the manufacturer must register its establishment, list the generic category or classification name of the medical device being marketed and pay a registration fee.
 
 16
 
510(k) Clearance Process: A Class II medical device normally requires FDA clearance in the United States pursuant to the 510(k) clearance process. The 510(k) clearance process is available to medical device developers that can demonstrate that their device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device. In this process, the developer would be required to submit data that supports the equivalence claim and wait for an order from the FDA finding substantial equivalence to another legally marketed medical device before distributing the device for commercial sale. Modifications to cleared medical devices can be made without using the 510(k) process if the changes do not significantly affect safety or effectiveness.
Premarket Approval: A more rigorous and time-consuming process applicable to Class III medical devices, known as pre-market approval (“PMA”) which would require the developer to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective. This is done by submitting data regarding design, materials, bench and animal testing and human clinical data for the medical device. The FDA will authorize commercial release of a Class III medical device if it determines there is reasonable assurance that the medical device is safe and effective. This determination is based on benefit outweighing risk for the population intended to be treated with the device. This process is much more detailed, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) clearance process.
 
The basic design of our delivery system will be similar to those functions used in current predicate devices. However, our therapy requires the administration of a higher concentration of NO than is currently approved by the FDA. Therefore, the FDA could reject a Class II-510(k) and declare it not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, and set it on the regulatory path of Class III-PMA.
 
Continuing Regulation of Approved or Cleared Drugs and Medical Devices. Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approval or clearance are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including requirements for ongoing recordkeeping, annual product quality review, annual reporting, post-market surveillance requirements, post-market study commitments, drug adverse experience reporting in a timely fashion, maintenance of pharmacovigilance program to proactively monitor for adverse events and medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur.
Quality System Regulation. Companies engaged in the manufacture of medical devices or their components are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements. Medical devices must comply with QSR requirements. These requirements impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers related to the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for designing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storing, medical devices. Following these inspections, the FDA may assert noncompliance with QSR requirements on a Form 483, which is a report of observations from an inspection, or by way of “untitled letters” or “warning letters” that could cause us or any third-party manufacturers to modify certain activities. A Form 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, can list conditions the FDA investigators believe may have violated QSR or other FDA requirements. We cannot be certain that we or our present or any future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with QSR or other FDA regulatory requirements to the agency’s satisfaction. Failure to comply with these obligations may lead to possible legal or regulatory enforcement action by the FDA, such as suspension of manufacturing, operating restrictions, seizure or recall of product, injunctive action, withdrawal of approval or clearance, import detention, refusal or delay in approving or clearing new products or supplemental applications, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
Advertising and Promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of medical devices, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications about unapproved uses, industry- sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Devices may be marketed only for the approved or cleared indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved or cleared label.
 
 17
 
Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe approved devices for “off-label” uses—that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the product’s labeling. These off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use. Thus, we may market our products, if approved by the FDA, only for their approved indications, but under certain conditions may engage in non-promotional, balanced communication regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject us to adverse publicity and a variety of sanctions, which could harm our business and financial condition.
 
Anti-Kickback, False Claims Act and Other Laws. In addition to the FDA’s ongoing post-approval regulation of devices discussed above, several other types of laws and regulations, subject to differing enforcement regimes, govern advertising and promotion. In recent years, promotional activities regarding FDA-regulated products have come under intense scrutiny and have been the subject of enforcement action brought by the Department of Justice and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities and even private individuals.
 
A development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal civil False Claims Act to impose liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. In addition, many states have enacted false claim laws similar to the federal False Claims Act. If certain conditions are met, the False Claims Act allows a private individual (typically a “whistleblower”) to bring a civil action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery. Engaging in impermissible promotion of our products for off-label uses can subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, which can lead to civil money penalties, restitution, criminal fines and imprisonment and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals against pharmaceutical and device companies for off-label promotion has increased dramatically.
 
The federal Anti-Kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical or device manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Any sales or marketing practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny under the Anti-Kickback statute. Many states have likewise adopted state anti-kickback statutes and enforcement has been significant.
 
A host of other laws and regulations govern the advertising and promotion of devices. The federal Sunshine Law, which is part of the Health Care Reform Law, each enacted in March 2010, imposes federal “sunshine” provisions, requiring annual reporting of various types of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. CMS published the first set of data about these financial relationships on its website on September 30, 2014. Inaccurate or incomplete reports may be subject to enforcement. Like the federal Sunshine Law, several states have existing laws that require manufacturers to report transfers of value to select healthcare providers licensed within the state. Additionally, other laws such as the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws allow competitors and others to initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. Additionally, the FCPA and local laws of other countries potentially implicate the sale and marketing of devices internationally. This complex patchwork of laws can change rapidly with relatively short notice.
 
Environmental Laws. Elements of our potential products may be classified as hazardous materials, subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation, the International Air Transportation Association, the International Maritime Organization, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which may impose various requirements pertaining to the way we manufacture, transport, store, handle and dispose of our products.
European Regulation. In order for our products to be marketed and sold in the EEA, we must obtain the required regulatory approvals and comply with the extensive regulations regarding safety, manufacturing processes and quality requirements of the respective countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals to market, and the various regulatory frameworks may differ. In addition, there may be foreign regulatory barriers other than approval or clearance.
 
 18
 
Medicinal Product Approval. In the EEA, we expect our products to be regulated as a combination drug-delivery device product falling within the scope of Directive 2001/83/EC, commonly known as the Community Code on medicinal products. Under this Directive, we are required to obtain a marketing authorization for our products before they are placed on the market. Medicinal products must be authorized in one of two ways, either through the decentralized procedure or mutual recognition procedure by the competent authorities of the EEA Member States, or through the centralized procedure by the European Commission following a positive opinion by the EMA. The authorization process is essentially the same irrespective of which route is used, and requires us to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the NO delivered to the patient by our product. We are also required to demonstrate that the drug delivery component of our products complies with the relevant Essential Requirements contained in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive.
 
Innovative medicinal products are authorized in the EEA on the basis of a full marketing authorization application that must contain the results of pharmaceutical tests, pre-clinical tests and clinical trials conducted with the medicinal product for which marketing authorization is sought, and demonstrating the product’s quality, safety and efficacy. Once approved, an innovative medicinal product is entitled to eight years of data exclusivity. During this period, no application for approval of a generic version of the innovative product relying on data contained in the marketing authorization dossier for the innovative product may be submitted. Innovative medicinal products are also entitled to ten years of market exclusivity. During this 10-year period, no generic medicinal product can be placed on the EU market. The 10-year period of market exclusivity can be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the holder of the marketing authorization for the innovative product obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 
After expiration of the data exclusivity period, an application for marketing authorization for a generic version of an approved innovative medicinal product may be submitted. Such an application does not contain data demonstrating the proposed product’s quality, safety and efficacy, but instead relies on the data in the dossier for the related innovative product, and a demonstration that the two products are the same and bioequivalent. If approved, the generic product may not be placed on the market until expiration of the 10-year marketing exclusivity period for the innovative medicinal product.
 
A marketing application for a product that, although similar to an approved medicinal product does not qualify as a generic, may also seek to rely to some degree on the data in the dossier for the approved product. As with a generic product, the application may not be submitted until expiration of the data exclusivity period, and the product, if approved, may not be placed on the market until expiration of the market exclusivity period. Such an application must also contain data specific to the proposed product, however. The extent to which such a “hybrid” application requires new data is determined on a case-by-case basis by the competent authorities, based on the differences between the innovative medicinal product and the medicinal product subject to the hybrid application for marketing authorization. The purpose of the pre-clinical tests and clinical trials is to generate additional data that complement the data relating to the innovative medicinal product and to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product for which authorization is sought.
 
Because an NO formulation is already authorized in the EEA for treating pulmonary hypertension, we expect to be able to seek marketing authorization for our products under the “hybrid” approach described in the previous paragraph. We anticipate that the hybrid application for marketing authorization will require the successful completion of limited studies confirming the quality, safety and efficacy of the NO formulation delivered using our proprietary delivery technology.
 
Continuing Regulation. As in the United States, marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and/or the competent authorities of the EEA Member States. This oversight applies both before and after grant of manufacturing and marketing authorizations. It includes control of compliance with EU GMP rules and pharmacovigilance rules.

In the EEA, the advertising and promotion of our products will also be subject to EEA Member States’ laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State legislation that may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics (“SmPC”), as approved by the competent authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion, which is prohibited. The applicable laws at the EU level and in the individual EEA Member States also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EEA could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with health care professionals.
 
Interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct in the individual EEA Member States. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EEA Members states, including the UK Bribery Act 2010. Payments made to physicians in certain EEA Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her competent professional organization and/or the competent authorities of the individual EEA Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EEA Member States.
 
Pricing and Reimbursement. Each EEA Member State is free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices and/or reimbursement levels of medicinal products for human use. An EEA Member State may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the medicinal product, or alternatively adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the medicinal product on the market, including volume-based arrangements and reference pricing mechanisms.
 
Health technology assessment (“HTA”) of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EEA Member States, particularly the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Sweden. The HTA process in each EEA Member State is governed by the national laws of the country. HTA is the procedure according to which an assessment is conducted of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products, as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EEA Member States. The extents to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product vary between EEA Member States.
 
Data Privacy Regulation. The collection and use of personal health data in the EEA is governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive. This Directive imposes a number of requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity. In the European Union, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product.
 
 20
 
In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 
Exceptional Circumstances/Conditional Approval. Orphan medicinal product or products for unmet medical needs may be eligible for EU approval under exceptional circumstances or with conditional approval. Approval under exceptional circumstances is applicable to orphan products and is used when an applicant is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use because the indication for which the product is intended is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, when the present state of scientific knowledge does not allow comprehensive information to be provided, or when it is medically unethical to collect such information. Conditional marketing authorization is applicable to orphan medicinal products, medicinal products for seriously debilitating or life- threatening diseases or medicinal products to be used in emergency situations in response to recognized public threats. Conditional marketing authorization can be granted on the basis of less complete data than is normally required in order to meet unmet medical needs and in the interest of public health, provided the risk-benefit balance is positive, it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide the comprehensive clinical data, and unmet medical needs will be fulfilled.
 
Conditional marketing authorization is subject to certain specific obligations to be reviewed annually.
 
Other Regulations. We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Regulation in Israel. In order to conduct clinical testing on humans in the State of Israel, special authorization must first be obtained from the ethics committee and general manager of the institution in which the clinical studies are scheduled to be conducted, as required under the Guidelines for Clinical Trials in Human Subjects implemented pursuant to the Israeli Public Health Regulations (Clinical Trials in Human Subjects), as amended from time to time, and other applicable legislation. These regulations require authorization by the institutional ethics committee and general manager as well as from the Israeli Ministry of Health, except in certain circumstances, and in the case of genetic trials, special fertility trials and complex clinical trials, an additional authorization of the Ministry of Health’s overseeing ethics committee. The institutional ethics committee must, among other things, evaluate the anticipated benefits that are likely to be derived from the project to determine if it justifies the risks and inconvenience to be inflicted on the human subjects, and the committee must ensure that adequate protection exists for the rights and safety of the participants as well as the accuracy of the information gathered in the course of the clinical testing. Since we perform a portion of the clinical studies on certain of our therapeutic candidates in Israel, we are required to obtain authorization from the ethics committee and general manager of each institution in which we intend to conduct our clinical trials, and in most cases, from the Israeli Ministry of Health.
