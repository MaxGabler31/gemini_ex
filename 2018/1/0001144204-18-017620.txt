Item 1. Business
History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 2, 2013, under our original name of River Run Acquisition Corporation. On May 5, 2014, we issued 500,000 shares of common stock to Rubin Schindermann and 500,000 shares of Common Stock to Alexander Starr. With the issuance of these shares and the redemption of 19,500,000 shares of common stock issued to our original officers, directors and shareholders, we effected a change of control. Mr. Schindermann and Mr. Starr became our new officers and directors. They accepted the resignations of our original founding officers and directors. Effective May 13, 2014, the Company changed its name to Chess Supersite Corporation.
 
On July 23, 2014, we acquired certain assets (“Acquisition”) of Chess Supersite, Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of Ontario, Canada (“Chess Canada”). The Acquisition was consummated pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement and the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock to Chess Canada. In the Acquisition, we acquired all right, title and interest in and to the properties, assets, interests and rights of Chess Canada, including the contracts and intellectual property which are related to the business of developing, operating and maintaining a website focused on the game of chess. Chess Supersite, Inc. is under the common control of Rubin Schindermann and Alexander Starr.
 
Overview
 
The Company operates an online chess site featuring sophisticated playing zones, game broadcasts with software analyses and top analysts' commentaries, education and other chess oriented resources. We believe that chess players have two major needs: (i) to play against each other and (ii) to watch chess matches between to players including Grandmasters. To meet that need , we have developed “Chess Stars” as an interactive and educational website that allows chess players to play online, watch broadcasted chess tournaments, learn to play and improve their skills and to participate in our patent-pending “Choose Your Moves and Win” contests. Utilizing advanced two-tier architecture, “Chess Stars” can support virtually an unlimited range of content and services designed to attract viewers. With a model similar to that of TV poker, viewers are able to see an odds matrix for any position on the chess board. Percentage of success for each move is based on statistics, computer analysis and our proprietary value calculations. The viewing of chess games is particularly adaptable to the Internet to allow for real time or archival viewing while enjoying the comments, announcements and analyses of top chess experts. We anticipate we will be able to deliver high quality viewing and game-playing experiences featuring broadcasts of top worldwide games, education, interactivity, playing and other services and facilitate the emergence of chess as a mainstream sport.
 
In October 2016, we started our Chess Stars Club Membership Program. Club members enjoy free entry to all events, including our cash prize events. Club membership costs $12.95 per month or $99.00 per year. At the present time, we have sold 93 Club memberships. We have derived our revenues at date from the sale of Club memberships and our live events such as Chess Stars Camps, live chess tournaments and Chess Festivals with attendees paying on the average of $50.00 per person.
 
We have spent approximately $470,000 on software development and have issued shares fair valued at approximately $1.9mn to consultants and advisors. These expenses have been partially capitalized as Intangible Assets and the remaining part has been reported by us on the statement of operations as website development, software development and advisory and consulting expenses, and represent a major value to the Company and its investors.
 
Effective March 1, 2016, the Company issued its Non-Negotiable Convertible Promissory Notes (“Notes”) to two private investors in the aggregate principal amount of $300,000. Each of the Notes was in the principal amount of $150,000 with a maturity date of September 1, 2016 (“Maturity Date”), at which time the outstanding principal and interest balance was due and payable. Each of the Notes is convertible into Common Stock of the Company at a conversion price equal to 45% of the lowest trading price of the Common Stock as reported on the OTC Markets Group’s OTC Pink quotation service. The Notes provide that the holders cannot exercise their respective rights of conversion prior to the Maturity Date and that any such conversion is limited to the holders beneficially holding not more than 4.99% of the Company’s then issued and outstanding Common Stock after conversion.
 
Effective May 19, 2016, the Company completed a private funding transaction with a private institutional investor under the terms of the Company’s 8% Convertible Redeemable Note (“Note”) in the principal amount of $75,000.00 dated May 19, 2016. The maturity date of the Note was May 19, 2017 (“Maturity Date”), at which time the outstanding principal and interest balance was due and payable. The Note provides, among other things, that in the event the Note holder exercises the right of conversion, the conversion price was equal to 52% of the lowest closing bid price of the Company’s common stock for the twenty (20) trading days prior to the date of conversion. The Note further provides that such conversion was limited to the holder beneficially holding not more than 4.99% of the Company’s then issued and outstanding common stock after the conversion. The proceeds of the Note were used by the Company for general working capital purposes.

On September 15, 2016, we issued a Convertible Promissory Note (“Crown Bridge Note”) to Crown Bridge Partners, LLC (“Crown Bridge”) in the principal amount of $30,000 pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement of the same date. Under the Crown Bridge Note, Crown Bridge has the right to convert all or any a part of the outstanding principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest into shares of our Common Stock at the conversion price equal to a 45% discount of the market price of our Common Stock. The Crown Bridge Note contains a provision limiting the number of shares issuable upon conversion to not more than 4.99% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company at the time of conversion. In addition, Crown Bridge has “piggy-back” registration rights covering our Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Crown Bridge Note in the event we file a registration statement for any other of our securities.
 
On October 18, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“Blackbridge Purchase Agreement”) with Blackbridge Capital Growth Fund, LLC (“Blackbridge Capital”). Pursuant to the Blackbridge Purchase Agreement, the maximum draw down amount allowed is equal to the lesser of (i) $125,000 or (ii) 200% of the average daily trading volume of our Common Stock for the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the draw down notice. Pursuant to the Blackbridge Purchase Agreement, we issued our Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $140,000 in payment of the commitment fee payable to Blackbridge. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the pending S1 registration statement was withdrawn, removing the benefit associated with the prepaid asset. The amount was therefore written off as commitment fee in the statement of operations.
 
On January 31, 2017, we issued a Convertible Promissory Note to an investor in the principal amount of $33,000 with a maturity date of May 5, 2018 (“Maturity Date”), at which time the outstanding principal and interest balance is due and payable. Each of the Notes is convertible into Common Stock of the Company at a conversion price equal to 58% of the lowest trading price of the Common Stock as reported on the OTC Markets Group’s OTC Pink quotation service. The Notes provide that the holders cannot exercise their respective rights of conversion prior to the Maturity Date and that any such conversion is limited to the holders beneficially holding not more than 4.99% of the Company’s then issued and outstanding Common Stock after conversion.
 
On May 5, 2017, we issued a Convertible Promissory Note to an investor in the principal amount of $23,000 with a maturity date of August 20, 2018 (“Maturity Date”), at which time the outstanding principal and interest balance is due and payable. Each of the Notes is convertible into Common Stock of the Company at a conversion price equal to 58% of the lowest trading price of the Common Stock as reported on the OTC Markets Group’s OTC Pink quotation service.

Each of the Notes is convertible into Common Stock of the Company at a conversion price equal to 58% of the lowest trading price of the Common Stock as reported on the OTC Markets Group’s OTC Pink quotation service. The Notes provide that the holders cannot exercise their respective rights of conversion prior to the Maturity Date and that any such conversion is limited to the holders beneficially holding not more than 4.99% of the Company’s then issued and outstanding Common Stock after conversion.
 
Employees
 
We currently have two employees, Rubin Schindermann, our CEO, and Alexander Starr, our President. We have contracted with a number of independent contractors and consultants to provide a range of information technology and marketing services who do not receive cash compensation but receive shares of our common stock as compensation. This mitigates any need for full or part-time employees for these services.
Intellectual Property Protection
 
On July 8, 2016, we submitted an International Patent Application with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office for an “Interactive Expectation-Based System and Method” for our online chess competition entitled “Choose Your Moves and Win”. Patent application is pending as of March 23, 2018.
Competition
 
We compete with companies that develop games for networks, on both web and mobile, vary in size and include companies such as DeNA Co. Ltd. (Japan), Electronic Arts Inc., Gameloft SA, GREE International, Inc., Glu Mobile Inc., King.com Inc., Zynga, Inc., Rovio Mobile Ltd., Supercell Inc., GungHo Online Entertainment, Inc., Kabam and The Walt Disney Company. Furthermore, we expect new competitors to continuously enter the market and existing competitors to allocate more resources to develop and market competing games and applications. At the present time, we have identified a number of chess online sites which could be considered competitors, such as Chess.com; InstantChess; SparkChess and Chess24, among others. We are committed to establishing and maintaining the highest quality interactive chess playing and learning site.
