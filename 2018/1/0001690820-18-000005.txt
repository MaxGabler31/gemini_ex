ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Carvana Co. is a holding company that was formed as a Delaware corporation on November 29, 2016. Carvana Co. Class A common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CVNA.” On May 3, 2017, Carvana Co. completed its initial public offering ("IPO") of 15.0 million shares of Class A common stock at a public offering price of $15.00 per share. Carvana Co. received approximately $205.8 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, which it used to purchase approximately 18.8 million newly-issued membership interests of Carvana Group, LLC ("Carvana Group") at a price per unit equal to 0.8 times the initial public offering price less underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for additional information about our IPO and organizational transactions completed in connection with our IPO. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this report to "Carvana," the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to both Carvana Group and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the IPO described in this report and to Carvana Co. and its consolidated subsidiaries following the IPO and organizational transactions completed in connection with our IPO.
Our Company
Carvana is a leading eCommerce platform for buying used cars. We are transforming the used car buying experience by giving consumers what they want — a wide selection, great value and quality, transparent pricing and a simple, no-pressure transaction. Each element of our business, from inventory procurement to fulfillment and overall ease of the online transaction, has been built for this singular purpose.
We provide a refreshingly different and convenient car buying experience that can save buyers time and money. On our platform, consumers can research and identify a vehicle, inspect it using our proprietary 360-degree vehicle imaging technology, obtain financing and warranty coverage, purchase the vehicle, and schedule delivery or pick-up, all from their desktop or mobile devices. Our transaction technologies and online platform transform a traditionally time consuming process by allowing customers to secure financing, complete a purchase and schedule delivery online in as little as 10 minutes.

Our technology and infrastructure allow us to seamlessly and cost efficiently deliver this car buying experience to our customers. We use proprietary algorithms to optimize our nationally pooled inventory of over 9,500 vehicles, inspect and recondition our vehicles based on our 150-point inspection process and operate our own logistics network to deliver cars directly to customers as soon as the next day. Customers in certain markets also have the option to pick up their vehicle at one of our proprietary vending machines, which provides an exciting pick-up experience for the customer while decreasing our variable costs, increasing scalability and building brand awareness.
The automotive retail industry’s structure presents an opportunity for disruption. It is the largest consumer retail industry in the United States and is highly fragmented. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. automotive industry generated approximately $1.2 trillion in sales in 2017, while Edmunds.com estimates the U.S. used vehicle sales market at over $739 billion in 2016. With little brand differentiation, there are approximately 43,000 used car dealerships in the United States according to Borrell Associates' 2017 Outlook and the largest dealer brand commands approximately 1.7% of the U.S. market according to Edmunds.com and publicly-listed dealership filings. Additionally, consumers are often dissatisfied with the car buying process. According to the DealerSocket 2016 Independent Dealership Action Report ("DealerSocket 2016"), 81% of North American consumers do not enjoy the car buying process, and car salesmen are among the least trusted professionals, according to a 2016 Gallup poll.
Carvana has demonstrated that its custom-built business model can capitalize on this opportunity. From the launch of our first market in January 2013 through December 31, 2017, we purchased, reconditioned, sold and delivered approximately 71,900 vehicles to customers through our website, generating $1.4 billion in revenue. Our sales have grown as we have added new markets and increased our market penetration in our current markets. As of December 31, 2017, our in-house distribution network services 44 metropolitan markets, and we plan to continue to expand our network into additional markets. 
Industry Background & Market Opportunity
Exceptionally Large and Fragmented Market
The U.S. automotive industry generated approximately $1.2 trillion in sales in 2017, which comprised roughly 21% of the U.S. retail economy and made it the largest consumer retail market in the United States according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Edmunds.com estimates the U.S. used vehicle sales market at over $739 billion in 2016, representing approximately 38.5 million used vehicle transactions at an average sales price of $19,189.
The used car retail industry is highly fragmented. There are approximately 43,000 used car dealerships in the U.S according to Borrell Associates' 2017 Outlook. The largest dealer brand commands approximately 1.7% of the U.S. market and the top 100 used car retailers collectively hold approximately 7.0% market share, according to Edmunds.com, publicly-listed dealership filings and Automotive News.
The traditional used car retailing model is costly, operationally challenging and difficult to scale. Providing an end-to-end solution requires inspection, repair, reconditioning and showroom facilities, as well as inventory sourcing and financing capabilities, substantially all of which is traditionally done at each dealership location. According to publicly-listed dealership filings, some full service dealerships providing all of these services can require an initial investment of up to $22 million. Additional variable costs include the salaries of on-site employees, inventory financing fees and vehicle transportation costs.
Customer acquisition is expensive and inefficient for traditional automotive retailers as they are typically confined to local advertising channels and have to drive foot traffic to their physical locations, where they offer an often undifferentiated service and limited inventory.
Additional challenges in auto retailing, both online and offline, stem from the following unique characteristics of selling cars:
• big ticket item, often representing one of the customer’s largest and longest lifecycle purchases;
• range of taste in make, model, body style, price, year, mileage, color, drivetrain and features;
• second most expensive purchase many consumers make and finance;
4

• complex transaction often involving a vehicle trade-in and the purchase of add-on service products to protect the customer’s investment;
• reliance on third parties for critical business functions; and
• state and local regulatory compliance variability.
The Way Consumers Buy Cars Is Changing
Historically, consumers discovered vehicles for sale through local print and broadcast media, as well as word of mouth, and would go to dealerships to educate themselves on potential purchases. However, consumers no longer rely solely on traditional media and dealerships to discover and research vehicles. According to the Cars Online 2014 report from Capgemini, 97% of customer vehicle purchases involve online research. In fact, the 2016 Car Buyer Journey report from Autotrader indicates that a typical used car buyer spends approximately nine hours researching his or her prospective car purchase online.
As eCommerce has become more established, reaching 10.5% of total retail sales in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2017 according to the U.S. Census Bureau, consumers have become more comfortable buying taste-driven, higher-priced products such as consumer electronics and home furnishings online. Similarly, auto consumers are interested in eCommerce solutions for their car purchasing needs — 80% of U.S. car buyers would consider completing their entire car purchase online if given the opportunity, according to Capgemini’s 2017 Cars Online Trend Study.
What Auto Consumers Want
As a result of the unique aspects of purchasing a vehicle, consumers have a distinct set of expectations that are challenging for traditional used auto retailers to address.
• Wide selection. Automobiles vary widely in model, style, color, age and price, and consumers exhibit differing tastes, style and purchasing goals and budgets. This requires dealers to maintain a broad inventory and offer multiple financing, warranty and service plan choices.
• Traditional used auto retailers are limited by staging capacity and anticipated local demand at each dealership; they generally lack the logistical capabilities to source vehicles from other locations quickly and cost-effectively.
• Value. Auto consumers want consistent, fair value.
• Traditional used car retailers have high overhead costs and must pass these costs on to their customers.
• Confidence in quality. Auto consumers want to have comfort that the vehicle they purchase is mechanically sound and will not require costly repairs or replacement in the near term.
• Traditional used auto retailers may lack the scale and expertise to consistently purchase high quality vehicles and uniformly recondition them, increasing the incidence of selling a “lemon.”
• Control and no pressure. Auto consumers want to feel in control of the buying process, without being pressured.
• According to DealerSocket 2016, 81% of North American consumers do not enjoy the car buying process, and U.S. car salespeople are among the least trusted professionals, according to a 2016 Gallup poll.
• Fast, simple purchasing process. Auto consumers want their transaction to be convenient, fair and on their own desired timeline.
• Buying a car at a traditional auto dealership is often a multi-part transaction including vehicle purchase, trade-in, financing and complementary products, and requires over three hours on average, according to the 2016 Car Buyer Journey report from Autotrader.

Carvana’s Solution
In response to these evolving consumer needs, we built Carvana to provide a no-pressure, no-haggle experience with flexible and fast transactions. Consumers can research and identify a vehicle, inspect it using interactive high definition photography, obtain financing and warranty coverage, complete their purchase and schedule delivery or pick up, all from our online platform. Our uniformed employees deliver cars to customers in branded single car haulers as soon as the next day, and we offer a seven-day return policy on all our cars sold. The sales process we have built enables our customers to execute their purchases, once a car has been selected, in as little as 10 minutes.
We aim to deliver the best selection, best value and best experience for used car buyers.
The Best Selection
As of December 31, 2017, we offer all customers a nationally pooled inventory of over 9,500 high-quality used vehicles. We evaluate all of the vehicles that we own and offer for sale using our 150-point “Carvana Certified” inspection process, which we are able to perform at scale across our network of inspection and reconditioning centers (“IRCs”). Our customer research indicates that size and range of selection are primary determinants of where customers will transact. We use proprietary algorithms to optimize our inventory acquisition based on extensive used vehicle market and customer behavior data. Furthermore, our nationally pooled inventory system maximizes the breadth of vehicle selection for our customers in any given location. This results in a higher likelihood that customers are able to find the make, model, year and color combination that they desire. In contrast, traditional dealerships are limited in range of selection because they typically optimize a local inventory of a few hundred vehicles at each dealership location, even if they own thousands of vehicles across multiple distributed locations.
The Best Value
Our proprietary technology and vertically-integrated business model allow us to enjoy a significantly lower variable cost structure versus traditional dealerships and provide substantial value to our customers. We do not require a network of brick-and-mortar dealerships, staffed with sales personnel; instead, we utilize both an in-house logistics network and proprietary vending machines to facilitate trade-ins and vehicle delivery. These savings are passed on to the consumer through sales prices that are below industry averages. Additionally, we believe our pooled inventory approach will result in lower average days to sale, which we expect will help improve margins due to decreased vehicle depreciation resulting in higher unit selling price. Furthermore, we are able to provide personalized and highly-transparent financing terms based on basic customer information that results in faster transaction times, clear lending terms and competitive interest rates.
The Best Experience
We aim to provide the best car buying experience available for our customers through a fully-integrated, convenient online shopping experience. Our proprietary 360-degree vehicle imaging technology provides transparency by allowing customers to view vehicle features and imperfections. We also provide automated trade-in valuations, automated financing, GAP waiver coverage and vehicle service contracts (“VSC”). Customers can easily select among various pricing and pre-approved financing terms and receive approval in seconds.
We offer a premium fulfillment experience with pick-up and delivery options available, including pick-up at our vending machines or fulfillment centers in some markets. Our in-house customer advocates are available to answer customer questions that arise throughout the process. At every customer touch point, we strive to provide the level of customer service that makes purchasing a car from us an enjoyable, memorable experience. Finally, we offer seven-day return and 100-day warranty policies with every car we sell. We believe that our customers value the ease of use and transparency of our platform. They have responded favorably to our solution, as illustrated by the ratings we receive. Our customers rated us an average of 4.7 out of 5.0 as of December 31, 2017, and 95% of them said they would recommend us to a friend when responding to over 13,000 satisfaction surveys we solicited from our inception through December 31, 2017. These positive reactions create opportunities for repeat customers and a strong referral network.

Strengths & Competitive Advantages
Our business model is disrupting the traditional used vehicle sales model. Our primary goal is to rapidly scale vehicle unit sales by focusing on delivering an unparalleled customer experience. Since our inception in 2012, we have been developing and leveraging the following key strengths of our robust platform, which we believe provide significant competitive advantages.
Purpose-Built Vertically-Integrated eCommerce Platform
We built our used car eCommerce platform because we believe a lower and differentiated cost structure is critical to providing a seamless, best-in-class car buying experience. We believe that traditional dealerships and other technology-enabled auto platforms do not provide this type of experience, and that our end-to-end model allows us to offer a superior solution while reducing our cost of operations and enhancing our ability to offer complementary products and services. Our vertically-integrated platform gives us control of all critical operations and transaction elements, which facilitates a fast, simple and
consistent user experience. We control the algorithms that help determine the vehicles we make available to our customers, the prices of those vehicles, the financing terms and GAP waiver coverage and VSC options available to our customers and the trade-in values we offer. Additionally, we control the logistics infrastructure that enables us to offer customers fast, specific and reliable delivery times. We have invested heavily in our custom designed website to provide a cutting edge user interface, and have built a team of in-house customer advocates that is dedicated to providing first-rate customer service.
Differentiated Shopping Experience
We have developed technology that makes the online vehicle purchasing process intuitive, transparent and fun. Our proprietary photo booth, paired with custom photo processing and display technology, provides an interactive way for consumers to search for vehicles and take a virtual tour of the interior and exterior of a vehicle using annotated, high definition photography. We believe this technology, coupled with our certification process and seven-day return policy, generates the confidence and trust in our platform needed to buy a car online.
Proprietary Financing Technology
Our differentiated financing solutions provide customers with nearly instantaneous credit decisions as well as flexibility and transparency in financing their vehicle purchase. We preapprove thousands of down payment and monthly payment combinations that allow customers to choose their preferred financing. We preapprove these terms utilizing “soft credit checks” which do not impact a customer’s credit unless they complete a purchase and financing transaction. Due to our relatively low car prices, our customers generally have lower PTI (Payment to Income) and LTV (Loan to Value) ratios on their financing transactions than they would have at higher prices. This significantly enhances the quality of the automotive finance receivables that we generate and the premium we can capture when we sell the automotive finance receivables to our financing partners.
Efficient Logistics Network and Attractive Fulfillment Experience
We have developed proprietary logistics software and an in-house delivery network that differentiates us from competitors by allowing us to predictably and efficiently transport cars while providing customers a distinctive fulfillment experience. Our home delivery is conducted by a Carvana employee on a branded delivery truck. Customers in certain markets can also pick up their vehicles at one of our proprietary car vending machines, which are multi-story glass towers that store purchased vehicles, or at one of our fulfillment centers. These vending machines provide an attractive and unique experience for our customers
and develop brand awareness while lowering our vehicle fulfillment expenses. Following the opening of a vending machine in one of our markets, our market penetration has seen a meaningful increase while our variable operating costs per car sold have decreased. We intend to grow our logistics network and build vending machines in many of the metropolitan markets that we serve.
Scaled Used Vehicle Infrastructure
We currently leverage a network of four IRCs and supporting software for our vehicle reconditioning and logistics activities that required significant investment in time and capital to develop. We believe these facilities at full utilization give us capacity to inspect and recondition about 200,000 cars per year. Our proprietary inventory management system and 
7

Transportation Management System (“TMS”), combined with our expertise and experience gained from operating these facilities, position us well to continue to build out additional reconditioning and distribution centers as needed.
Scale Driving Powerful Network Effects
Our business benefits from powerful network effects. Our logistics capabilities allow us to offer every car in our inventory to customers across all of our markets. As we add markets, we expect to increase overall demand, which would enable us to carry a larger inventory. A broader vehicle inventory would further improve our offering across our markets, enabling us to increase market share. Furthermore, we anticipate increased brand awareness, driven by national advertising, will allow us to expand our national inventory and further these network effects.
Our Growth Strategies
The foundation of our business is retail vehicle unit sales. This drives the majority of our revenue and allows us to capture additional revenue streams associated with financing, VSCs and GAP waiver coverage, as well as trade-in vehicles. As we mature, we believe we will continue to improve conversion on these revenues and expand our offering of complementary products. However, all of these additional revenue opportunities are derived from retail vehicle unit sales and as a result, our growth strategies are primarily focused on this metric.
Our ability to generate vehicle sales is a function of the number of markets we operate in, our penetration in those markets and our ability to build and maintain our brand by offering great value, transparency and outstanding customer service. We plan to continue growing our vehicle unit sales, number of markets, market penetration and complementary product revenues while enhancing competitive positioning by executing the following key elements of our growth strategy:
Increase Sales Through Further Penetration of Our Existing Markets
We believe that our markets are at an early stage of growth when measured by market penetration. In Atlanta, our first and most mature market, we had approximately 1.3% market penetration for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to approximately 0.9% in the prior year, making us one of the largest used car dealers in Atlanta. We plan to continue marketing and actively building our brand in existing markets by improving our operations, opening additional vending machines, increasing our inventory size and growing brand awareness.
Continue to Enter Key Geographic Markets
We believe there is a substantial opportunity to utilize our capital-light expansion model and proven go-to-market strategy to enter additional markets by expanding our existing logistics network and advertising in those markets. We believe we can enter more markets than many of the larger dealership groups because of our lower cost structure, which allows us to efficiently operate in smaller markets. Furthermore, our nationally pooled inventory creates an even larger competitive advantage in these smaller markets, where customers typically have access to less inventory selection at local dealerships.
Continue to Innovate and Extend Our Technology Leadership
We will continue to make significant investments in improving and adding to our customer offering. We believe that the complexity of the automotive retail transaction provides substantial opportunity for technology investment and that our leadership and continued growth will enable us to responsibly invest in further separating ourselves from our competitors’ offerings.
Develop Broad Consumer Awareness of Our Brand
We believe our brand development efforts will meaningfully impact our ability to acquire new customers. We intend to attract new customers through advertising, public relations, and customer referrals. We believe these efforts will be further enhanced as we expand our national advertising campaigns, which we began in early 2017. We also plan to build vending machines in additional markets to capitalize on word of mouth publicity in building our brand awareness.

Develop New Products
We plan to leverage our existing eCommerce and logistics infrastructure to increase monetization opportunities by introducing new complementary products and services. The car purchasing and ownership cycle provides many opportunities to add value for our customers and our technology expertise and process automation position us well to provide these services in unique and differentiated ways.
Customer Lifecycle
Search and Discovery. We have developed a mobile-optimized website, where prospective car buyers can immediately begin browsing, researching, filtering and identifying their choice from an inventory of over 9,500 vehicles that we offer for sale. We have also developed a series of innovative features to enhance the customer experience on our website and enable better product discovery, such as highly engaging visual imagery and merchandising, as well as easy-to-use site navigation tools and personalization features. We also feature integrations with various vehicle data providers for vehicle feature and option information as a research tool to assist our customers with their purchase decisions.
Virtual Tour. Once customers select a vehicle, they have the ability to take an annotated virtual vehicle tour on our website, which includes a 360-degree view of the interior and exterior of the actual vehicle. This interactive tour allows customers to review vehicle imperfections through high definition photography and provides them with an extensive list of vehicle details, accessories and safety features presented in an intuitive and easy to review manner.
Seamless Transaction Technology. Once customers have chosen a vehicle, our platform allows them to complete the purchase in as little as 10 minutes, saving them both time and money.
• Financing. We pre-approve thousands of down payment and monthly payment combinations that allow customers to choose their preferred financing. Our website includes unique, highly engaging and intuitive financing tools that are transparent and demonstrate the relationship between preapproved down payment, monthly payment and term combinations. Our innovative financing tool allows borrowers to select an exact dollar payment plan based on thousands of permutations of APR, down payment, monthly payment and term. Our customers can obtain a financing decision in seconds generated by our proprietary credit scoring and loan structuring algorithms for every car in our inventory. This involves a short process that only requires ten fields to be completed and will not impact customers’ credit unless they complete a purchase and finance transaction.
• Complementary products. Our customers can further supplement their online vehicle purchase by electing to purchase a fully-integrated VSC, or extended warranty, serviced by an affiliate of DriveTime Automotive Group, Inc. (we will refer to DriveTime Automotive Group, Inc. together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, other than us, as "DriveTime"). In order to help improve the transaction experience, we evaluate numerous options to ultimately provide each customer with two plans that we believe will best meet their needs. Customers financing their purchase with us are also offered GAP waiver coverage, customized by term length, during checkout.
• Trade-in. For customers interested in pursuing a trade-in, our Cardian Angel tool provides customers with an automated valuation of their existing vehicle that can be applied to any vehicle purchase. Carvana will also purchase vehicles directly from customers without an associated vehicle purchase.
• Documentation and payment. To further improve the ease of financing, complementary products and trade-ins, we have developed a seamless, fully-integrated online documentation process. In certain markets, we have established partnerships with several technology providers that allow for automated down payment income verification and payment processing through simple, easy to use tools such as the ability to take pictures of required documents with a smartphone.
Fulfillment. Customers can choose to have their vehicle delivered or pick up their vehicle at one of our proprietary vehicle vending machines or fulfillment centers. In certain markets, we can deliver cars as soon as the next day with a Carvana-uniformed employee in a branded, custom single-car hauler. Our vending machines and fulfillment centers provide an attractive and unique customer pick-up experience that many customers choose. At our vending machines, the customer deposits a Carvana-branded token into a coin slot and an automated platform selects the customer’s car from the multi-story tower and delivers it to a garage bay where the customer is waiting with a Carvana delivery associate.
9

Post-sale customer support. Once customers have their car, our customer advocates manage the post-sale coordination and service call process including any claims from our standard 100-day / 4,189-mile “Worry Free Guarantee” warranty and the seven-day return policy. Given the return rates we have seen and the cost to us of honoring the return policy, we believe the peace of mind our customers gain from our seven-day return policy supports the cost of this offering. Our customers rated us an average of 4.7 out of 5.0 as of December 31, 2017, and 95% of them said they would recommend us to a
friend when responding to over 13,000 satisfaction surveys we solicited from our inception through December 31, 2017. These positive reactions create opportunities for repeat customers and a strong referral network.
Vehicle Lifecycle
Vehicle Acquisition. We acquire the substantial majority of our used vehicle inventory through the large and liquid national used-car auction market. The remainder of our inventory is acquired directly from customers, vehicle finance and leasing companies, rental car companies, and other suppliers. We use proprietary algorithms to determine which cars to bid on and how much to bid. Our software sifts through over 100,000 vehicles per day and filters out vehicles with accidents, poor condition ratings, or other unacceptable attributes, and can evaluate the tens of thousands of potential vehicle purchases that remain per day, creating a distinct competitive advantage versus in-person sourcing methods generally used by traditional dealerships. We assess vehicles on the basis of quality, inventory fit, consumer desirability, relative value, expected reconditioning costs and vehicle location to identify what we believe represent the most in-demand and profitable vehicles to acquire for inventory. We utilize a broad range of data sources, including proprietary site data and a variety of external data sources to support our assessments. Once our algorithms have identified a suitable vehicle for purchase, bids are verified and executed by a centralized team of inventory sourcing professionals.
Inspection and Reconditioning. Once we acquire a vehicle, we leverage our in-house logistics or a third party delivery service to transport the vehicle to one of our IRCs, at which point the vehicle is entered into our inventory management system. We then begin a 150-point inspection process covering controls, features, brakes, tires and cosmetics. Each IRC includes trained technicians, vehicle lifts, paint-less dent repair and paint capabilities and receives on-site support from third party vendors with whom we have integrated systems to ensure ready access to parts and materials. When an inspection is complete, we estimate the necessary reconditioning cost for the vehicle to be deemed "Carvana Certified" and expected timing to be made available for sale on our website.
Photography and Merchandising. To provide transparency to our customers, our proprietary, automated photo booths capture a 360-degree exterior and interior virtual tour of each vehicle in our website inventory. Our photo booths photograph the interior and exterior of the vehicle while annotating material defects based on visibility threshold category. We also feature integrations with various vehicle data providers for vehicle feature and option information. We have instituted a unified cosmetic standard across all IRCs to better ensure a consistent customer experience.
Transportation and Fulfillment. Third-party vehicle transportation is often slow, expensive and unreliable. To address these challenges, we built an in-house auto logistics network backed by a proprietary TMS to transport our vehicles nationwide. The system is based on a “hub and spoke” model, which connects all IRCs, logistics hubs and vending machines via our owned fleet of multi-car and single car haulers. Our TMS allows us to efficiently manage locations, routes, route capacities, trucks and drivers while also dynamically optimizing for speed and cost. We store inventory at our IRCs, and when a vehicle is sold, it is delivered directly to the customer or transported to a vending machine or fulfillment center for pick-up by the customer. Due to our robust and proprietary logistics infrastructure, we are able to offer our customers and operations team highly accurate predictions of vehicle availability, minimizing unanticipated delays and ensuring a seamless and reliable customer experience.
Markets
As of December 31, 2017, we have an established logistics network and a direct marketing presence in 44 major metropolitan cities and have purchased, reconditioned, sold and delivered approximately 71,900 vehicles since the launch of our first market in January 2013. We initially launched in Atlanta, Georgia in 2013 and have since grown our network across the United States, adding two markets in 2014, six in 2015, 12 in 2016 and 23 during 2017. We are committed to providing an honest, transparent and customer-centric used car buying experience online, which is achieved through our hub and spoke market approach. While our entire inventory of vehicles is available for sale across the United States through our own and third party delivery services, our focus is on serving our markets and providing the best possible car buying experience to our 
10

customers at a low, transparent cost. Our established logistics network and ability to deliver any car in our inventory on Carvana branded haulers to customers within our markets allow us to provide a low-cost, simple car buying experience.
Marketing
We believe our customer base is similar to the overall market for used cars at average price points of our vehicles. Our sales and marketing efforts utilize a multi-channel approach, built on a seasonality adjusted, market-based model budget. We utilize a combination of brand building as well as direct response channels to efficiently seed and scale our local markets. Our paid advertising efforts include, but are not limited to, advertisements through national and local television, search engine marketing, inventory site listing, retargeting, organic referral, display, out-of-home, digital radio, direct mail and branded pay-per-click channels. We believe our strong customer focus ensures customer loyalty which will drive both repeat purchases and referrals. In addition to our paid channels, we intend to attract new customers through enhancing our earned media and public relations efforts and further investing in our proprietary vending machines.
Customer Advocates
We have a team of in-house customer support specialists who provide assistance 13 hours per day, seven days per week to our customers located nationwide. Operating as advocates, our specialists are available to assist customers with questions that arise throughout the car buying process. These advocates are available via web chat or telephone and help customers navigate the website, answer specific questions and assist in loan verification by working with our customers to establish proof of identity, income and insurance. We take a consultative approach with our customers, offering live support and acting as a trusted partner to guide them through each phase of the purchase lifecycle. We are committed to providing our customers with the highest quality transaction experience and believe our advocates, who receive no commission income, are a meaningful reason why customers prefer transacting with us. The effectiveness of our model is reflected in the high ratings we receive from our customers and strong customer referrals. We focus on developing our advocates and providing them with the information and resources they need to offer exceptional customer service.
Competition
The U.S. used car marketplace is highly fragmented. There are approximately 43,000 used car dealerships in the United States according to Borrell Associates' 2017 Outlook, including approximately 27,000 independent dealerships. The largest dealer brand commands approximately 1.7% of the U.S. market and the top 100 used car retailers collectively hold approximately 7.0% market share, according to Edmunds.com, publicly-listed dealership filings and Automotive News. We believe the primary competitive factors in this market include transparency, convenience, price, selection and vehicle quality. Our current competitors can be largely classified into the following segments:
• franchised dealerships – 37% of establishments;
• independent dealerships – 63% of establishments; and
• online dealerships/marketplaces.
A number of used vehicles are also bought and sold through privately negotiated transactions.
We believe that our vertically-integrated business model provides a meaningful and sustainable competitive advantage.
Technology
Our business is driven by data and technology at all stages of the process, from inventory purchasing, reconditioning, photography and annotation through online merchandising, sales, financing, logistics, and delivery. Carvana’s proprietary and exclusive-use technology portfolio includes:
• a decisioning model for consolidating internal and third party data to provide profitability estimates for inventory available for purchase;
11

• a limited exclusivity license to an inventory management system that handles vehicles from acquisition through photography;
• a custom-built automated photography system with software that combines high-quality photos to produce an interactive, 360-degree virtual tour of both the exterior and interior of the vehicle;
• a website that includes advanced filtering and search technology that helps customers find a car that suits their tastes;
• a logistical model to optimize the transport of purchased inventory to the customer; and
• a custom automated delivery tower, or vending machine, including customer experience enhancements such as automatically generated video (suitable for posting to social media) that captures the customer’s pick-up experience.
We also rely on third party technology, including the following:
• customer identity verification for financing;
• transportation fleet telemetry;
• network infrastructure for hosting the website and inventory data;
• software libraries, development environments and tools;
• services to allow customers to digitally sign contracts;
• customer service call center management software; and
• automation controls and software for the vending machine.

Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 1,864 employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be strong.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets, patents and contractual provisions and restrictions on access and use of our proprietary information and technology.
We hold one issued patent covering our photo booth and imaging technology, and seven pending patent applications covering various technologies including our website user interface technology, our loan underwriting technology, and our vending machine technology.
We have nine trademark registrations, including registrations for “Carvana,” the Carvana logo, and various slogans. 
We are the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names, including “carvana.com.”
In addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with certain of our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners. Certain of our employees and contractors are also subject to invention assignment agreements. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our general and product-specific terms of use on our website.
Furthermore, we have a cross-license agreement with DriveTime pursuant to which DriveTime has obtained limited licenses to some of our intellectual property. 
Seasonality
We expect our quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, gross profit, profitability, if any, and cash flow to vary significantly in the future, based in part on, among other things, consumers’ car buying patterns. We are a growing company and our revenues have increased every quarter from our inception to date. However, we have experienced higher revenue growth rates in the first quarter of the calendar year than in each of the last three quarters of the calendar year. As we mature, we expect revenues may decrease in the second half of the calendar year. We believe these results are due to seasonal buying patterns driven in part by the timing of income tax refunds, which we believe are a primary source of our customers’ down payments on used vehicle purchases. Notably, as timing of income tax refunds has been pushed back in each of 2017 and 2018, we believe that the second quarter is increasingly showing stronger seasonality than in the past. Due to our short operating history and the overall growth of our business, these seasonal trends have not yet been pronounced, but we expect that in the future our revenues may be affected by these seasonal trends as well as cyclical trends affecting the overall economy, specifically the automotive retail industry. See Item 1A “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business —We may experience seasonal and other fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, which may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.”
Government Regulation
Various aspects of our business are or may be subject to U.S. federal and state regulation. In particular, the advertising, sale, financing and transport of used motor vehicles are highly regulated by states in which we do business and by the U.S. federal government. The regulatory bodies that regulate our business include the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), the Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Transportation (the “DOT”), the Occupational Health and Safety Administration ("OSHA"), the Department of Justice, the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”), various state dealer licensing authorities, various state consumer protection agencies and various state financial regulatory agencies. We are subject to compliance audits of our operations by many of these authorities.
Certain states have concluded that our activities are subject to vehicle dealer licensing laws, requiring us to maintain a used vehicle dealer license in order to conduct business in that state. We have at least one licensed facility in Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas.

Most states regulate retail installment sales, including setting a maximum interest rate, caps on certain fees, or maximum amounts financed. In addition, certain states require that finance companies in general and Carvana in particular file a notice of intent or have a sales finance license or an installment sellers license in order to solicit or originate installment sales in that state. We have obtained a sales finance license in Arizona, and Texas, an installment seller license in Florida and New Jersey, and have filed consumer credit notices in Colorado, Indiana, Kansas Oklahoma, and South Carolina.
For a discussion of the various risks we face from regulation and compliance matters, see Item 1A “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business —We operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales, results of operations and financial condition.”
