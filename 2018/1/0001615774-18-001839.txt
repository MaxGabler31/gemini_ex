The following diagram illustrates our corporate structure as of December 31, 2017:
 


Overview
 
We are dedicated to integrating and managing global healthcare services and resources, as well as empowering high-impact biomedical innovations and technologies to accelerate their clinical applications. Operating through two major platforms, namely “Avalon Cell”, and “Avalon Rehab”, our “Technology + Service” ecosystem covers the areas of regenerative medicine, cell-based immunotherapy, exosome technology, as well as rehabilitation medicine.
 
In addition, we are engaged in the development of exosome technology to improve diagnosis and management of diseases. Exosomes are tiny, subcellular, membrane-bound vesicles in diameter of 30-150 nm that are released by almost all cell types and that can carry membrane and cellular proteins, as well as genetic materials that are representative of the cell of origin. Profiling various bio-molecules in exosomes may serve as useful biomarkers for a wide variety of diseases. Our isolation system is designed to be used by researchers for biomarker discovery and clinical diagnostic development, and the advancement of targeted therapies. Currently, isolation systems and service are available to isolate exosomes or extract exosomal RNA/protein from serum/plasma, urine and saliva samples. We are seeking to decode proteomic and genomic alterations underlying a wide-range of pathologies, thus allowing for the introduction of novel non-invasive “liquid biopsies”. Our mission is focused toward diagnostic advancements in the fields of oncology, infectious diseases and fibrotic diseases, and discovery of disease-specific exosomes to provide disease origin insight necessary to enable personalized clinical management. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully achieve our stated mission.
 
We currently produce revenue by selling exosome isolation systems in China and the U.S through our Joint Venture GenExosome Technologies, Inc. In addition, we provide medical related consulting services in advanced areas of immunotherapy and second opinion/referral services through our wholly owned subsidiary Avalon (Shanghai) Healthcare Technology Co., Ltd. (“Avalon Shanghai”). We also own and operate commercial real estate in New Jersey where we are headquartered.
 
The value of the Renminbi (“RMB”), the main currency used in China, fluctuates and is affected by, among other things, changes in China’s political and economic conditions. The conversion of RMB into foreign currencies such as the U.S. dollar have generally been based on rates set by the People’s Bank of China, which are set daily based on the previous day’s interbank foreign exchange market rates and current exchange rates on the world financial markets.

Strategic Development
 
We intend to focus on three components. The initial component will be focused on acquiring and/or managing fixed assets including healthcare real estate as well as stem cell banks. In addition, we intend to pursue the acquisition and development of healthcare related technologies through acquisition, licensing or joint ventures. We will also consider a third avenue of investing in certain technologies.
Intellectual Property
 
Through GenExosome, we own four patents in China with related trademarks. We are in the process of applying for those same patents and trademarks in the United States and are also in the process of developing additional patents and related intellectual property. We own and control a variety of trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights that, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. We consider our trademarks, service marks, and other intellectual property to be proprietary, and rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, non-disclosure, and contractual safeguards to protect our intellectual property rights.
Competition
 
GenExosome Technologies, Inc. 
 
We currently market for sale of our proprietary Exosome isolation system. There are other companies that produce Exosome isolation systems. However, our internal analysis shows that most Exosome isolation systems use a centrifuge process for isolation which takes several hours and results in a low purity. Our isolation system is a membrane system which isolates exosomes in a few minutes with a higher purity than competing systems.
 
We believe that our proprietary isolation system is superior to competing systems and plan to continue to improve our process to maintain competitive advantages in the market.
 
Avalon Shanghai
 
In our current consulting business in the Peoples Republic of China (“PRC” or “China”), we compete with a number of advisory firm offering similar service including consulting and strategy firms; market research, data, benchmarking, and forecasting providers; technology vendors and services firms; health care information technology firms; technology advisory firms; outsourcing firms; and specialized providers of educational and training services. Other organizations, such as state and national trade associations, group purchasing organizations, non-profit think-tanks, and database companies, also may offer research, consulting, tools, and education services to health care and education organizations.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include quality and timeliness of our services, strength and depth of relationships with our clients, ability to meet the changing needs of current and prospective clients, measurable returns on customer investment, and service and affordability.
 
As our business develops and we expand through joint ventures, acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the U.S and PRC, we will have competition with other direct service providers, emerging technologies and medical communication platforms. Avalon will seek to maintain a competitive advantage through intellectual property, superior quality management and cutting edge technology.
 
Rt. 9 Properties, LLC.
 Our executive commercial building in Freehold, New Jersey is located on a major highway and is one of the largest buildings in the surrounding areas. It is centrally located and maintains high occupancy. There are other commercial properties in the vicinity that offer similar amenities. However, premier executive offices are limited and as such we expect to continue to maintain high occupancy in the near term.
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we are subject to ordinary routine litigation incidental to our normal business operations. We are not currently a party to, and our property is not subject to, any material legal proceedings.
Employees
 
As of March 12, 2018, we employed 13 employees, seven of which are full time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining arrangement.
 
Government Regulation
 
The health care industry in the PRC and U.S. is highly regulated and subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences. Further, the healthcare industry is currently undergoing rapid change. We are uncertain how, when or in what context these new changes will be adopted or implemented. These new regulations could create unexpected liabilities for us, could cause us or our members to incur additional costs and could restrict our or our clients’ operations. Many of the laws are complex and their application to us, our clients, or the specific services and relationships we have with our members are not always clear. Our failure to anticipate accurately the application of these laws and regulations, or our other failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and otherwise negatively affect our business.
 
7


Despite efforts to develop its legal system over the past several decades, including but not limited to legislation dealing with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade, the PRC continues to lack a comprehensive system of laws. Further, the laws that do exist in the PRC are often vague, ambiguous and difficult to enforce, which could negatively affect our ability to do business in China and compete with other companies in our segments.
 
In September 2006, the Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”) promulgated the Regulations on Foreign Investors’ Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises (“M&A Regulations”) in an effort to better regulate foreign investment in PRC. The M&A Regulations were adopted in part as a needed codification of certain joint venture formation and operating practices, and also in response to the government’s increasing concern about protecting domestic companies in perceived key industries and those associated with national security, as well as the outflow of well-known trademarks, including traditional Chinese brands.
 
As a U.S. based company doing business in PRC, we seek to comply with all PRC laws, rules and regulations and pronouncements, and endeavor to obtain all necessary approvals from applicable PRC regulatory agencies such as the MOFCOM, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration for Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”).
 
Company History
 
On October 19, 2016, we entered into and closed a Share Exchange Agreement with the shareholders of Avalon Healthcare System, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“AHS”), each of which are accredited investors (“AHS Shareholders”) pursuant to which we acquired 100% of the outstanding securities of AHS in exchange for 50,000,000 shares of our common stock (the “AHS Acquisition”). Considering that, following the acquisition, the AHS Shareholders control the majority of our outstanding voting common stock and we effectively succeeded our otherwise minimal operations to those that are theirs, AHS is considered the accounting acquirer in this reverse-acquisition transaction. A reverse-acquisition transaction is considered, and accounted for as, a capital transaction in substance; it is equivalent to the issuance of AHS securities for our net monetary assets, which are deminimus, accompanied by a recapitalization. Accordingly, we have not recognized any goodwill or other intangible assets in connection with this reverse acquisition transaction. AHS is the surviving and continuing entities and the historical financials following the reverse acquisition transaction will be those of AHS. We were a “shell company” (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) immediately prior to our acquisition of AHS pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement. AHS owns 100% of the capital stock of Avalon (Shanghai) Healthcare Technology Co., Ltd. (“Avalon Shanghai”), which is a wholly foreign-owned enterprise organized under the laws of the PRC. Avalon Shanghai was incorporated on April 29, 2016 and is engaged in medical related consulting services for customers. Consequently, we believe that acquisition has caused us to cease to be a shell company as we no longer have nominal operations.
 
On September 29, 2016, effective October 18, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate”) with the State of Delaware to (i) effect a reverse stock split of its outstanding and authorized shares of common stock at a ratio of 1 for 4 (the “Reverse Stock Split”) and (ii) effectuate a name change (“Name Change”). Fractional shares that resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the next highest number. As a result of the Name Change, the Company’s name changed from “Global Technologies Corp.” to “Avalon GloboCare Corp.”. The Certificate was approved by the majority of the Company’s shareholders and by the Board of Directors of the Company. The effective date of the Reverse Stock Split and the Name Change was October 18, 2016.
 
In connection with the above, the Company filed an Issuer Company-Related Action Notification Form with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Reverse Stock Split and the Name Change were implemented by FINRA on October 18, 2016. Our symbol on the OTCQB was GTHCD for 20 business days from October 18, 2016 (the “Notification Period”). Following the Notification Period, our symbol was changed to “AVCO”. Our new CUSIP number is 05344R 104.
 
On December 22, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement of Sale (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Freehold Craig Road Partnership (“Seller”), a New Jersey partnership, to purchase certain real property located in the Township of Freehold, County of Monmouth, State of New Jersey, having a street address of 4400 Route 9 South, Freehold, NJ 07728 (the “Property”). All rights under the Purchase Agreement were assigned by the Company to Avalon RT 9 Properties, LLC, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary (“Avalon RT 9”). Avalon Properties closed on the purchase of the Property on May 5, 2017. The purchase price including adjustments paid by the Company for the Property was $7.65 million in cash. The Seller also assigned all lease agreements for all tenants on the Property to Avalon RT 9.
 
In July 2017, the Company formed GenExosome Technologies Inc., a Nevada corporation (“GenExosome”). On September 29, 2017, Dr. David K. Jin was appointed as the sole director and as the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Medical Officer and President, Meng Li was appointed as Chief Operating Officer and Secretary and Luisa Ingargiola was appointed as Chief Financial Officer. On October 25, 2017, GenExosome and the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired 600 shares of GenExosome in consideration of $1,326,087 in cash and 500,000 shares of common stock of the Company.
 
On October 25, 2017, GenExosome entered into and closed an Asset Purchase Agreement with Yu Zhou, MD, PhD, pursuant to which the Company acquired all assets, including all intellectual property, held by Dr. Zhou pertaining to the business of researching, developing and commercializing exosome technologies including, but not limited to, patent application number CN 2016 1 0675107.5 (application of an Exosomal MicroRNA in plasma as biomarker to diagnosis liver cancer), patent application number CN 2016 1 0675110.7 (clinical application of circulating exosome carried miRNA-33b in the diagnosis of liver cancer), patent application number CN 2017 1 0330847.X (saliva exosome based methods and composition for the diagnosis, staging and prognosis of oral cancer) and patent application number CN 2017 1 0330835.7 (a novel exosome-based therapeutics against proliferative oral diseases). In consideration of the assets, GenExosome agreed to pay Dr. Zhou $876,087 in cash no later than November 24, 2017, transfer 500,000 shares of common stock of the Company to Dr. Zhou no later than November 24, 2017 and issue Dr. Zhou 400 shares of common stock of GenExosome no later than November 24, 2017. The above transactions have since been completed and and as a result, the Company holds 60% of GenExosome and Dr. Zhou holds 40% of GenExosome.
