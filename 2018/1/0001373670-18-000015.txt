ITEM 1. BUSINESS
References
Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the “Company”, “Green Brick”, “we”, “us” or “our” refer to the consolidated company, which has been renamed Green Brick Partners, Inc. and its subsidiaries, resulting from the acquisition by BioFuel Energy Corp. and its then consolidated subsidiaries (“BioFuel”) of JBGL Builder Finance LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively “Builder Finance”), and JBGL Capital Companies (“Capital”), a combined group of commonly managed limited liability companies and partnerships (collectively with Builder Finance, “JBGL”) by means of a reverse recapitalization transaction on October 27, 2014.
General
Green Brick Partners, Inc. (formerly named BioFuel Energy Corp.) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on April 11, 2006, to invest solely in BioFuel Energy, LLC, a limited liability company organized on January 25, 2006, to build and operate ethanol production facilities in the midwestern United States. On November 22, 2013, the Company disposed of its ethanol plants and all related assets. Following the disposition of these production facilities, we were a public shell company with no substantial operations.
On June 10, 2014, the Company entered into a definitive transaction agreement with the owners of JBGL, which provided that we would acquire JBGL for $275.0 million, payable in cash and shares of our common stock (the “Transaction”). JBGL is a real estate operator involved in the purchase and development of land for residential use, construction lending and home building operations. The Transaction was completed on October 27, 2014. Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction, we paid the $275.0 million purchase price with approximately $191.8 million in cash and the remainder in 11,108,500 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $7.49 per share.
The cash portion of the purchase price was primarily funded from the proceeds of a $70.0 million rights offering conducted by the Company (the $70.0 million includes proceeds from purchases of shares of common stock by certain funds and accounts managed by Greenlight Capital, Inc. and its affiliates (“Greenlight”) and Third Point LLC and its affiliates (“Third Point”)) and $150.0 million of debt financing provided by Greenlight pursuant to a loan agreement, with the lenders from time to time party thereto, which provided for a five year term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”). In 2015, the Term Loan Facility was repaid in full.
For financial reporting purposes, the Transaction was deemed to be a capital transaction in substance and recorded as a reverse recapitalization of JBGL whereby JBGL is deemed to be the continuing, surviving entity for accounting purposes, but through reorganization, is deemed to have adopted the capital structure of BioFuel. Because the acquisition was considered a reverse recapitalization for accounting purposes, the combined historical financial statements of JBGL became our historical financial statements and from the completion of the acquisition on October 27, 2014, the financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis. The assets and liabilities of BioFuel were brought forward at their book value and no goodwill was recognized in connection with the Transaction. As a result of the Transaction, Green Brick changed its business direction and is now a diversified homebuilding and land development company.
On July 1, 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of 17 million shares of our common stock at a price of $10.00 per share and granted to the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an aggregate of 841,500 additional shares of common stock to cover over-allotments (the “Equity Offering”). On July 23, 2015, the underwriters exercised the option and purchased 444,897 additional shares. All of the shares were sold by us pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
The Equity Offering resulted in net proceeds of approximately $170.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. On July 1, 2015, we used approximately $154.9 million of the net proceeds from the Equity Offering to repay all of the outstanding principal, interest and a prepayment premium under the Term Loan Facility. Upon repayment, the Term Loan Facility was terminated and all security interests in, and all liens held by Greenlight with respect to, the assets of Green Brick securing the amounts owed under the Term Loan Facility were terminated and released. We used the remaining net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. 
Equity Issuance in Connection with the Acquisition of an Unconsolidated Entity 
On August 15, 2017, the Company, JBGL Ownership LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“JBGL”), and GB Challenger, LLC, a newly formed Texas limited liability company (the

“Challenger Subsidiary”) entered into a Membership Interest Purchase and Contribution Agreement (the “Challenger Agreement”) with The Challenger Group, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (“TCGI”), TCG Holdings, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company (“TCG”), GTG Holdings, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company (“GTG” and together with TCGI and TCG, the “Challenger Entities”) and Brian R. Bahr (“Bahr”), resulting in the Company, through its interest in JBGL, and the Challenger Entities owning a 49.9% and 50.1% ownership interest, respectively, in the Challenger Subsidiary, and the Challenger Subsidiary owning all of the membership and ownership interests in the subsidiaries of the Challenger Entities named in the Challenger Agreement (“Challenger Homebuilder Subsidiaries”). As consideration for such interests, the Company agreed to issue to the Challenger Entities, or their designees, 1,497,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, in a private placement, with 20,000 shares of its common stock held back pending satisfactory resolution of indemnification claims (“Holdback Shares”). The Company expects to issue the Holdback Shares during the second quarter of 2018; therefore, $0.2 million has been recorded in additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. The Challenger Entities, at their discretion, may offer to sell and transfer an additional 20.1% or, in certain circumstances, all of the Challenger Entities’ interest in the Challenger Subsidiary (“Additional Membership Interests”) to the Company on or after the third anniversary of the Challenger Agreement. The Company is not required to purchase the Additional Membership Interests. The Company incurred approximately $0.3 million in related acquisition costs which are included in the cost basis of investment in unconsolidated entity.
The Challenger Entities operate homebuilding operations under the name Challenger Homes. Challenger Homes constructs townhouses, single family homes and luxury patio homes, and is headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Company partnered with Challenger Homes in order to expand its business with partners who are complementary to its current builder partner group and to gain a presence in the Colorado Springs market. 
The Challenger Entities, together with the Company will direct the operations of the Challenger Homebuilder Subsidiaries through the Challenger Subsidiary, with the Company holding a noncontrolling interest. We hold two of the five board of managers (the “Managers”) seats of the Challenger Subsidiary. The Challenger Subsidiary’s six officers, employees of the Challenger Entities, were designated by the Managers for the purpose of managing the day to day operations. We do not have a controlling financial interest in the Challenger Subsidiary as we have less than 50% of the voting interests in the Challenger Subsidiary. Our investment in the Challenger Subsidiary is treated as an unconsolidated investment under the equity method of accounting, carried at cost, as adjusted for our share of income or losses and reduced for distributions received, and included in investment in unconsolidated entity in our consolidated balance sheets.
Our Company
We are a diversified homebuilding and land development company. We acquire and develop land, provide land and construction financing to our controlled builders and participate in the profits of our controlled builders. Our core markets are in the high growth U.S. metropolitan areas of Dallas, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia. We also own a noncontrolling interest in Challenger Homes in Colorado Springs, Colorado. We are engaged in all aspects of the homebuilding process, including land acquisition and the development, entitlements, design, construction, marketing and sales and the creation of brand images at our residential neighborhoods and master planned communities. We believe we offer higher quality homes with more distinctive designs and floor plans than those built by our competitors at comparable prices. Our communities are located in premium locations in our core markets and we seek to enhance homebuyer satisfaction by utilizing high-quality materials, offering a broad range of customization options and building well-crafted energy-efficient homes. We seek to maximize value over the long term and operate our business to mitigate risks in the event of a downturn by controlling costs and quickly reacting to regional and local market trends.
We are a leading lot developer in the Dallas and Atlanta markets and believe that our strict operating discipline provides us with a competitive advantage in seeking to maximize returns while minimizing risk. We currently own or control over 6,200 home sites in premium locations in the Dallas and Atlanta markets. We consider premium locations to be lot supply constrained with high housing demand where much of the surrounding land has already been developed. We are strategically positioned to either build new homes on our lots through our controlled builders or to sell finished lots to large unaffiliated homebuilders.
We sell finished lots or option lots from third-party developers to our controlled builders for their homebuilding operations and provide them with construction financing and strategic planning. Our controlled builders provide us with their local knowledge and relationships. We support our controlled builders by financing their purchases of land from us at an unlevered internal rate of return (“IRR”) of at least 20% and by providing construction financing at approximately a 13.8% or a 16.5% interest rate. Our income is further enhanced by our 50% equity interest in the profits of our controlled builders. In addition, the land we sell to third-party homebuilders also typically generates an unlevered IRR targeted at 20% or greater.

References to our “controlled builders” refer to our homebuilding subsidiaries in which we own a 50% equity interest and a 51% voting interest. In addition, we have the ability to appoint 2 of the 3 members of the board of managers of each controlled builder; therefore we are able to exercise control over the operations of each controlled builder.

During the first quarter of 2015, we formed Green Brick Title, LLC (“Green Brick Title”), our wholly-owned title company. Green Brick Title’s core business includes providing title insurance and closing and settlement services for our homebuyers. Green Brick Title had insignificant operations during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
The following chart sets forth the number of new homes delivered by our controlled builders, the home sales revenue, the average sales price of homes delivered and the amount of lot sales revenue generated during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Our backlog reflects the number and value of homes for which we have entered into sales contracts with customers but not yet delivered. With the exception of a normal cancellation rate, we expect all of the backlog as of December 31, 2017 to be filled during 2018. The following chart sets forth the backlog related to our builder operations segment during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Our Competitive Strengths
Our business is characterized by the following competitive strengths:
Optionality Provided by Our Combined Land Development and Homebuilding Structure
We are a diversified homebuilding and land development company. We are strategically positioned to either build and sell new homes on lots through our controlled builders or develop land and sell finished lots to large unaffiliated homebuilders. While our business plan has increasingly focused on building new homes on our owned and controlled lots, we proactively monitor market conditions to opportunistically sell a minority of our finished lots to large unaffiliated homebuilders if we believe that doing so will maximize our returns or lower our risk.

Experienced Management Team
Our management team is comprised of homebuilding and finance veterans that collectively have decades of experience and local knowledge of our core markets. Our founder and Chief Executive Officer, James R. Brickman has over 40 years of experience in real estate development and home building. Richard A. Costello, our Chief Financial Officer, joined the Company in 2015 and provides oversight of all financial reporting, lending relationships, audit supervision, cash management, and investor relations. Mr. Costello has over 25 years of financial and operational experience in all aspects of real estate management. Jed Dolson, President of Texas Region (formerly Head of Land Acquisition and Development), joined JBGL as an employee in 2013 and is responsible for land entitlement and development activities, including overseeing our land development operations in Dallas. Summer Loveland, our Chief Accounting Officer, joined the Company in 2017 and is responsible for the oversight of financial reporting, internal audit, treasury functions, and information technology. Our management team has a proven record of running profitable businesses and making prudent investment decisions. We believe that our experienced management team is well positioned to design and execute the development of complex, master planned residential communities.
Focus on Operations in Housing Markets with a Favorable Growth Outlook and Strong Demand Fundamentals
We currently operate in the Dallas and Atlanta markets, which we believe are among the most desirable homebuilding markets in the nation. We also operate in Colorado Springs through our noncontrolling interest in Challenger Homes. We believe our core markets exhibit attractive residential real estate investment characteristics, such as growing economies, improving levels of employment and population growth relative to national averages, favorable migration patterns, general housing affordability, and desirable lifestyle and weather characteristics.
Among the 12 largest metropolitan areas in the country, the Dallas metropolitan area ranked first in both the rate of job growth and the number of jobs from November 2016 to November 2017 (Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics, November 2017). The Atlanta metropolitan area ranked second in the rate of job growth and third in the number of jobs added from September 2016 to September 2017 (Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics, September 2017).
We believe that increasing demand and supply constraints in our core markets create favorable conditions for our future growth. 
Attractive Land Positions in Our Core Markets
We believe that we have strategically well-located land and lot positions within our core markets. We believe we have acquired our land and lot positions at attractive prices, providing us with significant opportunity for a healthy return on our investment. We expect the demand for housing in our core markets to continue to improve, due to rising consumer confidence, high affordability metrics, and a reduction in home inventory levels.
We seek to acquire land with convenient access to Dallas and Atlanta metropolitan areas which have diverse economic and employment bases and demographics that we believe will support long-term growth. For example, Capital currently owns, controls or is developing approximately 3,500 home sites under the brand Green Brick Communities in the Dallas market. Builder Finance owns or controls approximately 2,700 home sites in the Dallas and Atlanta markets.
We believe that our attractive inventory of home sites will enable us to capture the benefits of expected increases in home sales volume and home prices as the demand for new homes increases.
Land Sourcing and Evaluation Capabilities
We believe that our extensive experience and strong reputation of our management team combined with our long-standing relationships with other market participants provide us with a competitive advantage in efficiently sourcing, purchasing and entitling land. We are actively involved in every step of the land entitlement, home design and construction process with our controlled builders. Our management team has developed significant collaborative relationships over decades with land sellers, developers, contractors, lenders, brokers and investors throughout the Dallas and Atlanta markets. Our deep and wide-ranging knowledge of the Dallas and Atlanta markets and our ability to quickly and efficiently identify, acquire and develop land in desirable locations and on favorable terms are key to our success.
Disciplined Investment Approach
We seek to maximize value over the long-term and operate our business to mitigate risks in the event of a downturn by controlling costs and focusing on regional and local market trends.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Our management team has gained significant operating expertise through varied economic cycles. The perspective gained from these experiences has helped shape our investment approach. We believe that our management team has learned to effectively evaluate housing trends in our markets, and to react quickly and rationally to market changes. For example, we made significant land investments during the downturn at prices that we view as favorable. Our cycle-tested management approach balances strategic planning with local day-to-day decision-making responsibilities freeing up our controlled builders to concentrate on growing our homebuilding business rather than focusing on obtaining capital to fund their operations. We believe that our strict operating discipline provides us with a competitive advantage in seeking to maximize returns while minimizing risk.
Business Strategy
We believe we are well-positioned for growth in our core Dallas and Atlanta markets through the disciplined execution of the following elements of our strategy: 
Combine Land Acquisition and Development Expertise with Homebuilding Operations to Maximize Profitability
Our ability to identify, acquire and develop land in desirable locations and on favorable terms is critical to our success. We evaluate land opportunities based on how we expect such opportunities will contribute to overall profitability and returns, rather than how they might drive volume on a market basis. We believe our expertise in land development and planning enables us to create desirable communities that meet or exceed our target homebuyer’s expectations, while selling homes at competitive prices. Our strategy of holding land inventory provides us with a multi-year supply of lots for future homebuilding. We focus on the development of entitled parcels in communities where we can generally sell all lots and homes within 24 to 60 months from the start of sales. This focus allows us to limit exposure to land development and market cycle risk while pursuing favorable returns on our investments. We seek to minimize our exposure to land risk through disciplined management of entitlements, the use of land and lot options and other flexible land acquisition arrangements.
Maximize Benefits of Diversified Homebuilding and Land Development Structure
Our diversified homebuilding and land development structure provides the flexibility to monetize the value of our land assets either by building and selling homes through our controlled builders or developing land and selling finished lots to large unaffiliated homebuilders. When evaluating our land assets, we consider the potential contribution of each asset to our overall performance, taking into account the timeframe over which we may monetize the asset. While we currently expect the majority of our land to be utilized by our controlled homebuilders, we believe our land development and homebuilding strategy provides us with increased flexibility to seek to maximize risk-adjusted returns as market conditions warrant.
Increase Long-Term Value by Investing in Infrastructure
In our communities, we typically make enhanced investment in infrastructure, including landscaping and amenity centers, and enforce higher construction standards through our controlled builders. We believe this creates greater long-term value for us and for our controlled builders, homebuyers, shareholders and the communities in which we build.
Drive Revenue by Opening New Communities from Existing Land Supplies
We have strategically invested in new land in a number of prime neighborhoods in our core markets. We currently own or control over 6,200 home sites in the Dallas and Atlanta markets. We expect these land purchases to provide us with the opportunity for continued revenue growth and strong gross margin performance. We continue to identify development opportunities that should allow us to profit from lot sales, construction interest and our 50% equity interest in the profits of our controlled builders.
Increase Market Positions in Dallas and Atlanta
We believe that there are significant opportunities to profitably expand in our core Dallas and Atlanta markets. We continually review the allocation of our investments in these markets taking into account demographic trends and the likely impact on our operating results. We use the results of these reviews to reallocate our investments to those areas where we believe we can maximize our profitability and return on capital. We seek to use our local relationships with land sellers, brokers and investors to pursue the purchase of additional land parcels in our core markets. While our primary growth strategy focuses on increasing our market position in our existing markets, we may, on an opportunistic basis, explore expansion into attractive new markets.

Superior Design, Broad Product Range and Enhanced Homebuying Experience
Within each of our core markets, we partner our expertise with our controlled builders to design attractive neighborhoods and homes to appeal to a wide variety of potential homebuyers. One of our core operating philosophies is to create a culture which provides a positive, memorable experience for our homebuyers through active engagement in the building process. At higher price points, we provide our homebuyers with customization options to suit their specific needs and tastes. We engineer our homes for energy efficiency to reduce the impact on the environment and result in lower energy costs for our homebuyers. In consultation with nationally and locally recognized architecture firms, interior and exterior consultants and homeowner focus groups, we research and design a diversified range of products for various levels and price points. Our homebuilding projects include townhomes, single family homes and luxury custom homes. We believe we can adapt quickly to changing market conditions and optimize performance and returns while strategically reducing portfolio risk because of our diversified product strategy. 
Pursue Further Growth Through the Prudent Use of Leverage
As of December 31, 2017, our debt to total capitalization ratio is approximately 22%. It is our intent to prudently employ leverage to continue to invest in our land acquisition, development and homebuilding businesses. We intend to target a total capitalization ratio of approximately 35% to 40%, which we expect will provide us with significant additional growth capital.
Pursue Acquisitions of Additional Homebuilders
We intend to pursue the acquisition of additional homebuilders in our core and new markets. Our preference is to continue to acquire controlling interests in homebuilders with existing management continuing to own a significant ownership stake. We will seek to acquire and then retain management teams which have the strong local relationships with land owners and have a positive reputation for building well-crafted homes in their markets. We expect that our ability to provide capital discipline and strategic oversight will complement the local skills, relationships and reputations of our future homebuilder partners.
Our Homebuilding Neighborhoods
Our homebuilding neighborhoods usually take approximately 24 to 60 months to complete from the start of sales, although certain neighborhoods may take longer to complete. The following table presents neighborhood information relating to each of our controlled builders as of December 31, 2017, as well as current neighborhoods under development. Our backlog reflects the number and value of homes for which we have entered into sales contracts with customers but not yet delivered.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Owned and Controlled Lots
The following table presents the lots we owned or controlled (including lot option contracts) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 by market. Owned lots are those for which we hold title, while controlled lots are those for which we have the contractual right to acquire title but we do not currently own. With respect to controlled lots, we generally enter into lot option contracts where an earnest money deposit of up to 20% of the total purchase price of the lots is deposited with the seller. The earnest money deposit is applied to the purchase price of the lots within the lot option contract. Certain of our lot option contracts require an escalation in lot price from zero to six percent per year. The length of the lot option contract is generally based upon the number of lots being purchased and the agreed upon lot takedown schedule, which determines the number and frequency of lot purchases. Lot option contracts typically require two to four lot purchases per month.

Acquisition Process
Our ability to identify, evaluate and acquire land in desirable locations and on favorable terms is critical to our success. We evaluate land opportunities based on risk-adjusted returns and employ a rigorous due diligence process to identify risks, which we then seek to mitigate if we pursue the property.
We often purchase land parcels from large, long-term landowners who sell portions of their land to benefit from our experience in planning and executing complex land development projects. We also purchase land from large real estate developers who recognize the benefit of working with an experienced and reputable developer and homebuilder. Additionally, we acquire land from owners who want to leverage our expertise in land entitlement so that the owners may later sell all or part of their land to us after entitlement. We also acquire land from other developers who want our controlled builders to build homes in their neighborhoods.
We identify attractive properties that are typically located in existing prime neighborhood locations. We consider the existing and future supply of developable land before working to acquire the best-valued properties. Analysis includes consideration of development costs in addition to land costs. We have found that the prime quality infill locations have limited supply competition that may result in smaller value declines in down markets.
After contracting for a property, we perform due diligence to evaluate any environmental or geotechnical issues that may exist. We often seek to secure entitlements such as zoning or plat approval during this period. After title has been reviewed and approved, the property is acquired. We manage and oversee all land development with our in-house staff.

We offer a preferred lender referral program to provide lending options to homebuyers in need of financing. We offer homeowners a comprehensive warranty on each home. Homes are generally covered by a ten-year warranty for structural concerns, one year for defects and products used, two years for electrical, plumbing and HVAC parts and labor. 
We sell our homes through our own sales representatives and also through independent real estate brokers. Our in-house sales force typically works from sales offices located in model homes near or in each community. Sales representatives assist potential buyers by providing them with basic floor plans, price information, development and construction timetables, tours of model homes, and the selection of customization and upgrade options. Sales personnel are trained by us and generally have had prior experience selling new homes in the local market. Our personnel, along with subcontracted marketing and design consultants, carefully design the exterior and interior of each home to appeal to the lifestyles of targeted homebuyers. Additionally, we advertise through the use of model homes, Internet, newspapers, billboards, publications, brochures, and newsletters.
Seasonality
The homebuilding industry experiences seasonal fluctuations in quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in spring and summer, although this activity is also highly dependent on the number of active selling communities, timing of new community openings and other market factors. Since it typically takes five to nine months to construct a new home, we deliver more homes in the second half of the year as spring and summer home orders are delivered. Because of this seasonality, home starts, construction costs and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the second and third quarters, and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occur during the third and fourth quarters. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry.
Segments
Prior to the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company’s operations were organized into two reportable segments: builder operations and land development. Builder operations consisted of two operating segments: Texas and Georgia. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280, Segment Reporting (“ASC 280”), in determining our reportable segments, we considered similar economic and other characteristics, including geography, product types, production processes, average selling prices, gross profits, suppliers, land acquisition results, and underlying demand and supply.
In accordance with ASC 280, an operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), or decision-making group, to evaluate performance and make operating decisions. Prior to 2016, the Company identified its CODM as four key executives—the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and President of Texas Region (formerly, the Head of Land Acquisition and Development). As a result of the departure of the Chief Operating Officer, the management structure and CODM changed during 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company re-evaluated its reportable segments under ASC 280.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company identified its CODM as three key executives—the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and President of Texas Region. In determining the most appropriate reportable segments, the CODM considers similar economic and other characteristics, including geography, class of customers, product types and production processes. The discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by the current CODM group is different than in the past. As such, the builder operations reportable segment has consisted of three operating segments since the fourth quarter of 2016: Texas, Georgia, and corporate and other. The operations of the Company’s controlled builders were aggregated 
13

into the Texas and Georgia operating segments based on similar (1) economic characteristics; (2) housing products; (3) class of homebuyer; (4) regulatory environments; and (5) methods used to construct and sell homes.
Corporate operations is a non-operating segment that develops and implements strategic initiatives and supports the Company’s builder operations and land development segments by centralizing certain administrative functions such as finance, treasury, information technology and human resources. The majority of corporate personnel and resources are primarily dedicated to activities relating to the builder operations segment. Therefore, any unallocated corporate expenses are included in the corporate and other operating segment, within the builder operations segment which accounts for 95.9%, 96.1% and 87.3% of total revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
The Company uses the equity method of accounting for its investment in Challenger Subsidiary over which it exercises significant influence but does not have a controlling interest. The Challenger Subsidiary constructs townhouses, single family homes and luxury patio homes, and is headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado. While the operations of the Challenger Subsidiary meet the criteria for an operating segment within the builder operations segment, such operations did not meet the quantitative thresholds, as discussed in ASC 280, to be separately reported and disclosed. As such, Challenger Subsidiary’s results are included within the corporate and other operating segment, within the builder operations segment. 
While the operations of Green Brick Title are not economically similar to either builder operations or land development, the results of such operations did not meet the quantitative thresholds to be separately reported and disclosed. As such, Green Brick Title’s results are included within the builder operations segment within the corporate and other operating segment.
All 2015 segment information has been restated to conform with the 2016 and 2017 presentation. The changes in the reportable segments have no effect on the consolidated balance sheets, statements of income or cash flows for the periods presented. Financial information about our segments appears in Note 13, “Segment Information,” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Raw Materials
Typically, all the raw materials and most of the components used in our business are readily available in the United States. Most are standard items carried by major suppliers. However, a rapid increase in the number of homes started could cause shortages in the availability of such materials or in the price of services, thereby leading to delays in the delivery of homes. We continue to monitor the supply markets to achieve the best prices available. See “Risk Factors — Labor and raw material shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of land development and home construction, which could materially and adversely affect our business.”
Corporate Organization and Structure
We carry out our business generally through a number of project-specific, wholly-owned limited liability company subsidiaries. Our homebuilding operations business is conducted primarily through Builder Finance, and the land development operations conducts its business under the brand Green Brick Communities.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
Our developments are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements, the result of which is to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development and service fees for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development.
We are also subject to a variety of local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary according to multiple factors, including the site’s location, its environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site, as well as adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding and land development activity in environmentally sensitive regions or 
14

areas. In addition, in those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the restriction or elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. From time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and similar federal or state agencies review homebuilders’ compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to comply strictly with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken may increase our costs. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on homebuilders and land developers in the future. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber.
Under various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for related damages, including for bodily injury, and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. Please see the “Risk Factors” section elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
Competition in the homebuilding industry is intense, and there are relatively low barriers to entry. Homebuilders compete for, among other things, homebuyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. Increased competition could hurt our business, as it could prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market share expansion, and lead to pricing pressures on our homes that may adversely impact our revenues and margins. If we are unable to successfully compete, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our competitors may independently develop land and construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to our products. Furthermore, a number of our primary competitors are significantly larger, have a longer operating history and may have greater resources or lower cost of capital; accordingly, they may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which we operate. Many of these competitors also have longstanding relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which we operate. We also compete for sales with individual resales of existing homes and with available rental housing.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 260 employees, including those of our controlled builders. Although none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, certain of the subcontractors engaged by us or our affiliates are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining arrangements. We believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are favorable.
