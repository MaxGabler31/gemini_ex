Overview 
 RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation is a biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing immuno-oncology therapeutics to treat cancer based on our self-delivering RNAi (sd-rxRNA®) platform. Our sd-rxRNA compounds do not require a delivery vehicle to penetrate the cell and are designed to silence, or down-regulate, the expression of a specific gene that may be over-expressed in a disease condition. This provides RXi with a distinct advantage in adoptive cell therapy, the Companys initial focus and approach to immuno-oncology. 
 Prior to our acquisition of MirImmune Inc. (MirImmune) in January 2017, the Companys principal activities consisted of the preclinical and clinical development of our sd-rxRNA compounds and topical immunotherapy agent in the areas of dermatology and ophthalmology. With the acquisition of MirImmune, the Company completed a thorough review of its business operations, development programs and financial resources and made a strategic decision to focus solely on immuno-oncology to accelerate growth and in turn support a return on investment for its stockholders. As a result, the Company will seek to monetize its valuable dermatology and ophthalmology franchises through out-licensing or partnerships, thereby enabling a streamlined focus of the Companys resources on the development of our immuno-oncology program, with a focus on adoptive cell transfer. 
 Our sd-rxRNA Platform 
 Introduction to RNAi 
 DNA carries the genetic information of a cell and consists of thousands of genes. Each gene is highly unique and acts as instructions for making protein molecules. Proteins perform important tasks and are required for the structure, function and regulation of the bodys tissues and organs. In order for proteins to be made, the genes are first transcribed into RNA and the RNA is then translated into proteins. Overall, RNA is involved in the synthesis, regulation and processing of proteins. 
 Diseases are often related to the wrong protein being made, excessive amounts of a specific protein being made, or the correct protein being made but at the wrong location or time. RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological process in which RNA molecules inhibit gene expression or translation into proteins by preventing certain RNA from being read. RNAi offers a novel approach to the drug development process because RNAi compounds can potentially be designed to target any one of the thousands of human genes, many of which are undruggable by other modalities. Supported by numerous gene-silencing reports and our own research, we believe that this sequence information can be used to design RNAi compounds to interfere with the expression of almost any specific gene. 
Our RNAi Therapeutic Platform 
 The first design of RNAi compounds to be pursued for the development of human therapeutics were short, double-stranded RNAs that included limited modifications, known as small-interfering RNA (siRNA). Since the initial discovery of RNAi, drug delivery has been the primary challenge in developing RNAi-based therapeutics. One conventional solution to the delivery problem involves encapsulation of siRNA into a lipid-based particle, such as a liposome, to improve circulation time and cellular uptake. 
 RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation overcame the early challenges associated with RNAi-based therapeutics by developing an alternative approach where delivery and drug-like properties were built directly into the RNAi compound itself. These novel compounds are termed self-delivering RNAi compounds, or sd-rxRNA. sd-rxRNAs are hybrid oligonucleotide compounds that the Company believes combines the beneficial properties of both conventional RNAi and 
 
2 
 
 antisense technologies. Traditional, single-stranded antisense compounds have favorable tissue distribution and cellular uptake properties. However, they do not have the intracellular potency that is a hallmark of double-stranded RNAi compounds. Conversely, the duplex structure and hydrophilic character of traditional RNAi compounds results in poor tissue distribution and cellular uptake. In an attempt to combine the best properties of both technologies, sd-rxRNA have a single-stranded phosphorothioate region, a short duplex region, and contain a variety of nuclease-stabilizing and lipophilic chemical modifications. The combination of these features allows sd-rxRNA to achieve efficient spontaneous cellular uptake and potent, long-lasting intracellular activity. 
 We believe that our next generation sd-rxRNA compounds offer significant advantages over siRNAs used by other companies developing RNAi therapeutics, highlighted by the following characteristics: 
 

 | Efficient cellular uptake in the absence of a delivery vehicle;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | Potent RNAi activity;
--+----------------------


 | More resistant to nuclease degradation than unmodified oligonucleotides;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Able to suppress long non-coding RNAs, both in cytoplasm and the nucleus;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Readily manufactured;
--+----------------------


 | Potentially more specific for the target gene; and
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | Reduced immune side effects compared to classic siRNA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 The route by which an RNAi therapeutic is brought into contact with the body depends on the intended organ or tissue to be treated. Delivery routes can be simplified into two major categories: (1) local (when a drug is delivered directly to the tissue of interest); and (2) systemic (when a drug accesses the tissue of interest through the circulatory system). The key to therapeutic success with RNAi lies in delivering intact RNAi compounds to the target tissue and the interior of the target cells. To accomplish this, we developed a comprehensive platform that includes chemically synthesized RNAi compounds that are optimized for stability and efficacy and have unique properties that improve tissue and cell uptake. To date, we have shown safety and efficacy in a clinical setting with our sd-rxRNA compound RXI-109 using a local delivery approach via direct injection in the skin and eye with no additional delivery vehicle required. 
 In adoptive cell transfer (ACT), immune cells are isolated from specific patients or retrieved from allogeneic immune cell banks. The immune cells are then expanded and modified before being returned and used to treat the same patient. We believe our sd-rxRNA compounds are ideally suited to be used in combination with ACT, in order to make these immune cells more effective. Our approach involves the treatment of the immune cells with our sd-rxRNA compounds during the expansion and modification phase. Because our sd-rxRNA compounds do not require a delivery vehicle to penetrate into the cells, we are able to enhance these cells (for example by inhibiting the expression of immune checkpoint genes) by merely adding our sd-rxRNA compounds during their expansion process. After enhancing these cells ex-vivo, they are returned to the patient for treatment. In various types of immune cells tested to date, the sd-rxRNA treatment results in potent silencing while maintaining close to 100% transfection efficiency and nearly full cell viability.

Our Pipeline 
 

Our Immuno-Oncology Pipeline 
 In January 2017, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which it acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of MirImmune for an aggregate of 275,036 shares of common stock of the Company and 1,118,224 shares of the Companys Series C Convertible Preferred Stock. With the approval of the Companys stockholders at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, every ten shares of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding were automatically converted into one share of common stock. 
 Prior to our acquisition of MirImmune, the Companys principal activities consisted of the preclinical and clinical development of our sd-rxRNA compounds and topical immunotherapy agent in the areas of dermatology and ophthalmology. With the acquisition of MirImmune, the Company completed a thorough review of its business operations, development programs and financial resources and made a strategic decision to focus the Companys development portfolio solely on the field of immuno-oncology, with a near term emphasis on ACT. The Company believes this will accelerate growth and, in turn, support a return on investment for its stockholders. 
 ACT includes a number of different types of immunotherapy treatments. These treatments all use immune cells, such as T-cells, that are grown in a lab to large numbers, followed by administering them to the body to fight the cancer cells. Sometimes, immune cells that naturally recognize a tumor are used, while other times immune cells are modified or engineered to make them recognize and kill the cancer cells. There are several types of ACT, including: a.) endogenous cell therapy in which immune cells are grown from the patients tumor or blood, such as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and natural killer (NK) cells, and b.) engineered T-cells in which T-cells are genetically modified to recognize specific tumor proteins and to remain in an activated state (such as CAR T-cells and TCRs).

Our approach to immunotherapy builds on well-established methodologies of ACT. As shown below, immune cells are isolated from specific patients or retrieved from allogeneic immune cell banks and then expanded and sometimes processed to express tumor-binding receptors. Our method introduces a new and important step in ex vivo processing of immune cells. This step uses our sd-rxRNA technology to reduce or eliminate the expression of genes that make the immune cells less effective. For example, with our sd-rxRNA technology we can reduce the expression of immunosuppressive receptors or proteins by the therapeutic immune cells, potentially enabling them to overcome tumor resistance mechanisms and thus improving their ability to destroy the tumor cells. 
 

Our method provides some key advantages. One major advantage is that pre-treatment with our targeted compounds allows multiple immune checkpoints to be attenuated within the same therapeutic cell, an improvement which could dramatically increase their tumor cell killing capability. In addition, these therapeutic immune cells may lack some known side effects associated with the checkpoint inhibitor toxicity, while potentially improving efficacy over current immunotherapy approaches. 
 The main issue with ACT is that the cells are very susceptible to the cancer signals that turn down the immune response. Also, continuous activation of these cells causes them to become exhausted. These factors, among others, may reduce their efficacy and lifespan. A technology that can reprogram the immune cells using ACT is of key interest now in the immuno-oncology world. We believe that our sd-rxRNA therapeutics are uniquely positioned in the immuno-oncology field for the following reasons: 
 

 | Best RNAi therapeutic for ACT, as our sd-rxRNA compounds do not need facilitated delivery (mechanical or formulation);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Can target multiple genes (i.e., multiple immunosuppression pathways) in a single therapeutic entity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Demonstrated efficient uptake of sd-rxRNA to immune cells;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | Silencing by sd-rxRNA has a long-term effect in vivo;
--+------------------------------------------------------


 | Clinical proven safety of sd-rxRNA; and
--+----------------------------------------


 | Established current good manufacturing practices (cGMP).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 We currently have discovery and preclinical programs to develop our sd-rxRNA targeting PD-1, TIGIT and other undisclosed checkpoints in ACT for treatment of solid tumors. We are also developing sd-rxRNA against multiple undisclosed targets that influence cell differentiation and metabolism for use in ACT to treat hematologic cancers and solid tumors. 
 
5 
 
Our most advanced immuno-oncology programs are RXI-762 and RXI-804, sd-rxRNA compounds that suppress the expression of immune checkpoint proteins PD-1 and TIGIT, respectively, which, when used in ACT, can result in an improved efficacy to the targeted tumors. In August 2017, the Company announced the selection of these two sd-rxRNA compounds for preclinical development in ACT for solid tumors. We expect to enter clinical development with RXI-762 as part of an ACT therapy for solid tumors within the next 12  18 months. 
 We are advancing these compounds and our other discovery and preclinical ACT compounds towards clinical development, both independently and with our strategic collaborations. We plan to focus our internal resources on therapeutic areas where research and development is appropriate for the size and financial resources of the Company and to secure partners in therapeutic areas with the requisite expertise and resources to advance our product and research candidates through clinical development. We have established the following collaborations with several cancer research institutions and companies: 
 

The Company is collaborating with the Center for Cancer Immune Therapy (CCIT) at Herlev Hospital, a leading European center for use of TILs for ACT, to evaluate the potential of our sd-rxRNA technology platform in TILs for use in treatment for a number of cancer types, including melanoma and ovarian cancer. CCIT has carried out numerous clinical trials based on a direct translation of the discoveries from the laboratory. 
 Gustave Roussy is a leading comprehensive cancer center in Europe. Our collaborative research agreement is evaluating the potential of our sd-rxRNA technology platform for use in cancer treatments. The agreement covers research to design and evaluate our sd-rxRNA compounds in a human xenograft model. If the results are positive, this may lead to further development of these compounds for treatment of cancer. 
 Medigene AG is a German biotechnology company developing highly innovative, complementary treatment platforms to target various types and stages of cancer. Medigene AGs concentration is on the development of personalized T-cell-based immunotherapies. We are exploring the potential synergies of our sd-rxRNA technology in combination with Medigenes recombinant TCRs to develop modified T-cells with enhanced efficacy and/or safety with the ultimate goal to further improve Medigenes T-cell therapies for the treatment of cancer patients. The research teams at each company will work closely together to explore potential advantages of transient down regulation of certain genes to prevent negative regulation of T-cells expressing a recombinant TCR directed against a predefined tumor antigen. The two complementing technologies could lead to synergistic effects that might further sharpen and improve the therapeutic effects of Medigenes receptor modified T-cells.
Our preclinical research collaboration with PCI Biotech is evaluating the compatibility and synergy of our sd-rxRNA with PCI Biotechs fimaNAc technology based on in vivo studies. The Company is evaluating the results from this research collaboration to explore the potential for a further partnership. 
 
6 
 
One aspect of our ongoing strategy is to build upon these current collaborations to add additional partnerships to our immuno-oncology pipeline. If results from these collaborations and others are positive, the synergies between the Companys technology and its partners technology and expertise may provide multiple avenues for human clinical testing of the Companys sd-rxRNA compounds in ACT within the next 12  18 months. 
 Prior to our acquisition of MirImmune, they used our sd-rxRNA technology to demonstrate in vitro that multiple sd-rxRNA compounds can be used alone or in combination to target and silence extracellular and intracellular checkpoints in immune cells. Additional in vitro data demonstrated that PD-1 silencing by sd-rxRNA in patient-derived TILs resulted in enhanced killing of melanoma tumor cells from the same patient in culture. MirImmune also showed in a mouse model of human ovarian cancer that in vivo treatment with mesothelin-targeting CAR T-cells transfected with a PD-1 targeting sd-rxRNA significantly reduced the rate of tumor growth as compared to vehicle control. Furthermore, the silencing of PD-1 in the CAR T-cells isolated from these tumors persisted for at least one month. 
 We have demonstrated silencing of a number of undisclosed immunosuppressive targets in NK cells using our sd-rxRNA compounds. This adds to a remarkable set of immune checkpoint modulation studies in human T-cells, including CAR T-cells and TILs. In immune cells tested to date, sd-rxRNA treatment results in potent silencing while maintaining close to 100% transfection efficiency and nearly full cell viability. Moreover, the silencing effect has been validated in a number of clinically used cell treatment protocols. 
 We have identified lead sd-rxRNA compounds for each of several different checkpoints, including PD-1, TIGIT, CTLA-4 and other extracellular and intracellular targets. We are continuing to build on the work in immuno-oncology that MirImmune began, and we are initially focusing on furthering our efforts to inhibit checkpoints with CAR T-cell therapy and TILs in melanoma and ovarian cancer. 
 Our Dermatology and Ophthalmology Pipelines 
 In January 2018, the Company announced that its business strategy will focus solely on immuno-oncology therapeutics utilizing our proprietary sd-rxRNA technology. The Company plans to complete its current ongoing clinical trials in dermatology and ophthalmology with RXI-109 and Samcyprone and intends to partner and/or out-license these programs to continue the clinical development and commercialization. Successfully completing these transactions should allow the Company to monetize its valuable clinical assets to promote growth in our immuno-oncology focus area and extend our financial runway.

 RXI-109  Hypertrophic Scarring 
 The Companys lead product candidate and first RNAi clinical product candidate, RXI-109, is a sd-rxRNA that commenced human clinical trials in 2012. RXI-109 is designed to reduce the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a critical regulator of several biological pathways involved in fibrosis, including scar formation in the skin and eye. Two Phase 1 clinical trials completed by the Company demonstrated the safety and tolerability of RXI-109 in ascending single and multi-doses and also provided the first evidence of clinical activity in a surgical setting. The Phase 1 clinical trials provided the desired profile to enable the initiation of a Phase 2a clinical trial. Positive results from Study 1402, our Phase 2a clinical trial with RXI-109 in hypertrophic scars, were reported in December 2017. RXI-109 demonstrated an improved visual appearance for the treated scar over the control scar in one of the treatment arms. Statistically significant results were shown using the Investigator Scar Assessment Scale, which enables a structured clinical evaluation of scar quality, as well as using the Visual Analog Scale, a qualitative measure of overall scar appearance, for all follow-up time points in the same treatment arm. As an exploratory endpoint, patient reported outcome for scar ranking was evaluated. For the same treatment arm, 88% of the patients and 86% of the investigators indicated that the RXI-109 treated scar looked better over the control scar. RXI-109 was safe and well tolerated in all treatment arms. There were no drug-related serious adverse events and most other treatment emergent adverse events were those commonly found with intradermal injections, such as injection site pain and injection site erythema. RXI-109 can confidently be moved to Phase 2b of clinical development.

Samcyprone   Warts
Samcyprone, the Companys second clinical candidate, is a proprietary topical formulation of the small molecule diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP), an immunomodulator that works by initiating a T-cell response. The use of Samcyprone allows sensitization using much lower concentrations of DPCP than are used with existing compounded DPCP solutions, avoiding hyper-sensitization to subsequent challenge doses. Samcyprone is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2a clinical trial, Study 1502, for the clearance of common warts. 
 Study 1502, initiated in December 2015, included a sensitization phase in which a spot on the subjects upper arm and one or more warts was treated with Samcyprone. After being sensitized in this way, the subjects entered into the treatment phase where up to four warts were treated on a once weekly basis for ten weeks with a ten-fold lower concentration of Samcyprone than in the sensitization phase. During the trial, the warts were scored, photographed and measured to monitor the level of clearance. 
 In December 2016, the Company announced the results from a preliminary review of sensitization and wart clearance data from a subset of subjects that completed the ten-week treatment phase of Study 1502. Results showed that greater than 90% of the subjects demonstrated a sensitization response, a prerequisite to be able to develop a therapeutic response. Additionally, more than 60% of the subjects responded to the treatment by exhibiting either complete or greater than 50% clearance of all treated warts with up to ten weekly treatments. Samcyprone treatment has been generally safe and well tolerated and has had drug-related adverse events relating to local reactions, which are typically expected for this type of treatment due to the sensitization and challenge responses in the skin. The Company added a second cohort to the study to explore the opportunity to reduce the sensitization dose level, which will be more convenient to physicians and subjects. Enrollment and subject participation is complete and data analysis is currently ongoing. The Company expects to complete a readout of the final study before the end of the first half of 2018. 
 Cosmetic Development 
 Cosmetics are compounds that affect the appearance of the skin and make no preventative or therapeutic claims. These compounds may be developed more rapidly than therapeutics, therefore the path to market may be much shorter and less expensive. In October 2015, we announced the selection of lead sd-rxRNA compounds targeting tyrosinase (TYR) and collagenase (MMP1) as ingredients in the development of cosmetic products. TYR is a key enzyme in the synthesis of melanin. Melanin is produced by melanocytes and is the pigment that gives human skin, hair and eyes their color. The inhibition of TYR can play a key role in the management of skin conditions including cutaneous hyperpigmentation disorders such as lentigines (freckles, age spots and liver spots) and possibly melanoma. MMP1 is a key enzyme involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix. Reduction of MMP1 may be beneficial in the treatment of skin aging disorders, arthritis, acne scarring, blistering skin disorders, corneal erosions, endometriosis and possibly cancer metastasis. 
 RXI-231  Uneven Skin Tone and Pigmentation 
 RXI-231, an sd-rxRNA compound targeting TYR, is in development as a cosmetic ingredient that may improve the appearance of uneven skin tone and pigmentation. Three studies were performed under the consumer testing program. The first two studies in volunteers determined that the RXI-231 gel formulation does not cause irritation and sensitization when applied to the skin. The third study investigated the potential of RXI-231 to impact a skin melanin content (pigmentation) increase induced by UV exposure in a study design similar to one well documented in peer-reviewed journal articles and used by various cosmetic companies. Specific spectroscopic results showed that application of RXI-231 containing gel, as compared to a vehicle gel, can reduce a change of skin tone triggered by UV. These results not only validate our preclinical data about the effect of RXI-231 on skin pigmentation, but also provide important information on the capabilities of our proprietary topical formulation for the use of our sd-rxRNA based cosmetic ingredients in the consumer care space.

RXI-185  Wrinkles and Skin Laxity 
 RXI-185, an sd-rxRNA compound targeting MMP1, is in development as a cosmetic ingredient that may improve the appearance of wrinkles or skin laxity. Results from studies by the Company have shown a pronounced reduction in MMP1 mRNA levels that correspond to a similar reduction in MMP1 enzyme activity in cell culture in vitro. 
Ophthalmology Franchise 
 RXI-109  Retinal Scarring 
 As in dermal scarring, RXI-109 can also be used to target CTGF in the eye, where CTGF is known to be involved in retinal scarring. Building on the work in our dermal clinical program, the Company initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of RXI-109 in reducing the progression of retinal scarring. Study 1501 is a multi-dose, dose escalation study conducted in subjects with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with evidence of subretinal fibrosis. Each subject received four doses of RXI-109 by intraocular injection at one-month intervals for a total dosing period of three months. The safety and tolerability of RXI-109, as well as the potential for clinical activity, was evaluated over the course of the study using numerous assessments to monitor the health of the retina and to assess visual acuity. To date, there have been no safety issues that would have precluded continuation of dosing. Enrollment and subject participation is complete and data analysis is currently ongoing. The Company expects to complete a readout of the final study in the first half of 2018. 
Intellectual Property 
 We protect our proprietary information by means of United States and foreign patents, trademarks and copyrights. In addition, we rely upon trade secret protection and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our proprietary information and products. We have pending patent applications that relate to potential drug targets, compounds we are developing to modulate those targets, methods of making or using those compounds and proprietary elements of our drug discovery platform. 
 Much of our technology and many of our processes depend upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key scientific and technical personnel. To protect our rights to our proprietary know-how and technology, we require all employees, as well as our consultants and advisors when feasible, to enter into confidentiality agreements that require disclosure and assignment to us of ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by these employees, consultants and advisors in the course of their service to us, and we vigorously defend that position with partners, as well as with employees who leave the Company. 
 We have also obtained rights to various patents and patent applications under licenses with third parties, which require us to pay royalties, milestone payments, or both. The degree of patent protection for biotechnology products and processes, including ours, remains uncertain, both in the United States and in other important markets, because the scope of protection depends on decisions of patent offices, courts and lawmakers in these countries. There is no certainty that our existing patents or others, if obtained, will afford us substantial protection or commercial benefit. Similarly, there is no assurance that our pending patent applications or patent applications licensed from third parties will ultimately be granted as patents or that those patents that have been issued or are issued in the future will stand if they are challenged in court. We assess our license agreements on an ongoing basis and may from time to time terminate licenses to technology that we do not intend to employ in our technology platforms, or in our product discovery or development activities.

 Our research and development expense primarily consists of compensation-related costs for our employees dedicated to research and development activities, fees related to our Scientific Advisory Board members, expenses related to our ongoing research and development efforts including laboratory supplies and services for our research programs, our clinical trials, drug manufacturing, outside contract services, licensing fees and patent fees. 
 Total research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $5,370,000 and $5,415,000, respectively. 
 Acquired In-Process Research and Development 
 Assets purchased in an asset acquisition transaction are expensed as in-process research and development unless the assets acquired have an alternative future use. Acquired in-process research and development payments are immediately expensed and include upfront payments, as well as transaction fees and subsequent milestone payments. Development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. 
 Total acquired in-process research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $4,696,000. This expense related to the fair value of consideration given, which includes transaction costs, liabilities assumed and cancellation of notes receivable, and the deferred tax impact of the Companys acquisition of MirImmune in January 2017. There was no in-process research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the immuno-oncology field, are a constantly evolving landscape with rapidly advancing technologies and significant competition. There are a number of competitors in the immuno-oncology field including large and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other private and public research organizations. We believe that competitors in this field include, but are not limited to, Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (a Celgene Company), Kite Pharma, Inc. (a Gilead Company), Cellectis S.A., Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc, Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc., Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and NantKwest, Inc. Many larger pharmaceutical companies such as Novartis International AG, Celgene Corporation, Pfizer Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Amgen, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Gilead Sciences, Inc. and EMD Serono, Inc. have entered the field through major deals with biotechnology companies and academia. 
 We believe that other companies currently developing anti-scarring therapies in the areas of dermatology and ophthalmology include CoDa Therapeutics, Inc., Sirnaomics, Inc., FirstString Research, Inc., Promedior, Inc., FibroGen, Inc., miRagen Therapeutics, Inc., Ophthotech Corporation, Vascular BioSciences, Allergan plc, and Suneva Medical, Inc. 
 Government Regulation 
 The United States and many other countries extensively regulate the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution of drugs and biologic products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates pharmaceutical and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations. 
 To obtain approval of our future product candidates from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data supporting safety and efficacy for the intended indication as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate. In most cases, this will require extensive laboratory tests and preclinical and clinical trials. The collection of these data, as well as the preparation of applications for review by the FDA involve significant time and expense. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing to monitor the safety and efficacy of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the therapeutic claims and commercial applications of these products. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals if we fail to comply with regulatory standards or if we encounter problems at any time following initial marketing of our products. 
 The first stage of the FDA approval process for a new biologic or drug involves completion of preclinical studies and the submission of the results of these studies to the FDA. These data, together with proposed clinical protocols, manufacturing information, analytical data and other information submitted to the FDA in an investigational new drug (IND) application, must become effective before human clinical trials may commence. Preclinical studies generally involve FDA regulated laboratory evaluation of product characteristics and animal studies to assess the efficacy and safety of the product candidate. 
 After the IND becomes effective, a company may commence human clinical trials. These are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase 1 trials consist of testing the product candidate in a small number of patients or healthy volunteers, primarily for safety at one or more doses. Phase 2 trials, in addition to safety, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate in a patient population somewhat larger than Phase 1 trials. Phase 3 trials typically involve additional testing for safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at multiple test sites. A company must submit to the FDA a clinical protocol, accompanied by the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the institutions participating in the trials, prior to commencement of each clinical trial.

To obtain FDA marketing authorization, a company must submit to the FDA the results of the preclinical and clinical testing, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, in the form of a new drug application (NDA), or, in the case of a biologic, a biologics license application (BLA). 
 The amount of time taken by the FDA for approval of an NDA or BLA will depend upon a number of factors, including whether the product candidate has received priority review, the quality of the submission and studies presented, the potential contribution that the compound will make in improving the treatment of the disease in question and the workload at the FDA. 
 The FDA may, in some cases, confer upon an investigational product the status of a fast track product. A fast track product is defined as a new drug or biologic intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition that demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition. The FDA can base approval of an NDA or BLA for a fast track product on an effect on a surrogate endpoint, or on another endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. If a preliminary review of clinical data suggests that a fast track product may be effective, the FDA may initiate review of entire sections of a marketing application for a fast track product before the sponsor completes the application. 
 We anticipate that our products will be manufactured by our strategic partners, licensees or other third parties. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facilities are in compliance with the FDAs cGMP, which are regulations that govern the manufacture, holding and distribution of a product. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with the FDAs general biological product standards. Our manufacturers also will be subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Nuclear Energy and Radiation Control Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other applicable environmental statutes. Following approval, the FDA periodically inspects drug and biologic manufacturing facilities to ensure continued compliance with the cGMP. Our manufacturers will have to continue to comply with those requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing or recall or seizure of product. Adverse patient experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or market removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval. 
 The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of a drug or biologic product also must be in compliance with FDA and Federal Trade Commission requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for off-label promotion, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet, and direct-to-consumer advertising. We also will be subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. In addition, we will be subject to various laws and regulations governing laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of product approvals, seize or recall products and deny or withdraw approvals. 
 We will also be subject to a variety of regulations governing clinical trials and sales of our products outside the United States. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product candidate by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries and regions must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from one regulatory authority to another and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In the European Union, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar, in principle, to those in the United States.

Environmental Compliance 
 Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specific waste products. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of bio-hazardous materials. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be significant and may adversely affect capital expenditures to the extent we are required to procure expensive capital equipment to meet regulatory requirements.
