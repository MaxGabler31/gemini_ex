ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
CV Sciences, Inc. (the “Company,” “CV Sciences,” “we,” “our” or “us”) was incorporated under the name Foreclosure Solutions, Inc. in the State of Texas on December 9, 2010. On July 25, 2013, the Company’s predecessor, CannaVest Corp., a Texas corporation (“CannaVest Texas”), merged with the Company, a wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary of CannaVest Texas, to effectuate a change in the Company’s state of incorporation from Texas to Delaware. On January 4, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, reflecting its corporate name change to “CV Sciences, Inc.”, effective on January 5, 2016. In addition, on January 4, 2016, the Company amended its Bylaws to reflect its corporate name change to “CV Sciences, Inc.” The Company previously operated under the corporate name of CannaVest Corp. The change in corporate name was undertaken in connection with the acquisition of CanX Inc., a Florida-based, specialty pharmaceutical corporation (the “CanX Acquisition”) as more fully set forth in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January 4, 2016 (the “January 2016 8-K”). On June 8, 2016, the Company announced that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) had approved a change in the trading symbol for the Company’s common stock to “CVSI.” The Company’s common stock formerly traded under the symbol “CANV.” 
 
The Company operates two distinct business segments: a consumer products segment in manufacturing, marketing and selling plant-based Cannabidiol (“CBD”) products to a range of market sectors; and, a specialty pharmaceutical segment focused on developing and commercializing novel therapeutics utilizing synthetic CBD. The specialty pharmaceutical segment began development activities during the second quarter of 2016.
 
Current Operations
 
Consumer Products
 We manufacture, market and sell consumer products containing plant-based CBD under our PlusCBD™ brand in a range of market sectors including nutraceutical, beauty care, specialty foods and vape. We currently manufacture and distribute more than 50 stock-keeping units and we expect to continue to add new products to our PlusCBD™ portfolio to enhance our line of CBD and hemp-related consumer products. We also expect to develop and launch new brands to more effectively market and sell certain products. We also sell raw materials acquired through our supply relationships in Europe to various customers that produce products for resale into the market.
 
We seek to take advantage of an emerging worldwide trend to re-energize the production of industrial hemp and to foster its many uses for consumers. Historically cultivated for industrial and practical purposes, hemp is used today for textiles, paper, auto parts, biofuel, cosmetics, animal feed, nutritional supplements, and much more. The market for hemp-derived products is expected to increase substantially over the next five years, and we believe CV Sciences is well positioned to be a significant player in the hemp industry.
 
Hemp-derived CBD is one of at least 80 cannabinoids found in hemp, and is non-psychoactive. Our U.S. based operations oversee our raw material supply chain, raw material processing, product development and manufacturing, and sales and marketing. We will continue to scale-up our processing capability to accommodate new products in our pipeline.
 
We expect to realize revenue to fund our working capital needs through the sale of finished products and raw materials to third parties. However, in order to fund our drug development efforts, we will need to raise additional capital either through the issuance of equity and/or the issuance of debt. In the event we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital to fund our drug development efforts, we may need to curtail or delay such activity.

Specialty Pharmaceuticals
 Our specialty pharmaceutical segment is developing synthetic cannabinoids to treat a range of medical conditions. Cannabinoids are compounds derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, which contain two primary cannabinoids, CBD, and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Clinical and preclinical data suggest that CBD has promising results in treating a range of medical indications. We acquired two product candidates in the CanX Acquisition, each utilizing synthetic CBD as the active pharmaceutical ingredient.
 
The Company’s first patent-pending product candidate, CVSI-007, combines CBD and nicotine in treatment of smokeless tobacco use and addiction. There are currently no drugs approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) for treatment of smokeless tobacco use and addiction. We believe this product candidate will provide treatment options for this significant unmet medical need. The Company is hopeful to be in a position to file an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) with the FDA in the next 12 months. We completed a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in June 2017 and obtained guidance on this development program. CVSI-007 is based on proprietary formulations, processes and technology that we believe are patent-protectable. In May 2016, we filed a patent application for these formulations and processes with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. 
 
We currently contract with qualified parties and contract research organizations for our preclinical research and IND preparation and development. Commercialization of future specialty pharmaceutical products in the United States and other territories may rely on licensing and co-promotion agreements with strategic partners. If we choose to build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in the United States, such commercial infrastructure could include a sales organization, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support.
 
Description of our Subsidiaries
 
The Company owns 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of two subsidiaries: Plus CBD, LLC (formerly, “Global Hemp Source, LLC”) (“Plus CBD”), and CANNAVEST Acquisition, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formed in connection with the CanX Acquisition. The Company previously owned a 70% interest in CannaVest Europe, GmbH. On January 20, 2017, the Company filed for dissolution of CannaVest Europe, GmbH, with the District Court, Dusseldorf Germany, effective December 31, 2016. CannaVest Europe GmbH did not have any assets or liabilities at the time of its dissolution.
 
Inventory and Sales
 
Based on expected increasing demand, we have invested significant capital to develop and maintain relationships with growers on a global scale to ensure access to raw materials to support anticipated revenue growth. We have historically sourced our raw materials from well-established and well-recognized hemp growers in Europe. We have maintained access to these growers for their raw material supply, and continue to explore and develop other relationships to ensure that we can meet the expected demand for bulk hemp products well into the future. However, our current inventory levels are sufficient to support sales through 2019, resulting in reduced cash outflow for inventory purchases. In addition, we do not intend to purchase raw inventory from our supply chain arrangements from the 2017 and 2018 crop. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an impairment of inventory expense of $3.6 million (See Note 3 of the Company’s consolidated financial statements). No impairment of inventory expense was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
Subject to applicable law, discussed further below we have initiated hemp research and development studies in the U.S. in Kentucky through partnerships with the Kentucky State Department of Agriculture and several universities, on a pilot scale.
 
Changes in the Law and Development Programs
 
For the first time since 1937, industrial hemp has been decriminalized at the federal level and can be grown legally in the United States, but on a limited basis. A landmark provision passed in the Agricultural Act of 2014 recognizes hemp as distinct from its genetic cousin, marijuana. Federal law now exempts industrial hemp from U.S. drug laws to allow for crop research by universities, colleges and state agriculture departments. The new Federal law allows for agricultural pilot programs for industrial hemp “in states that permit the growth or cultivation of hemp.”

Under the jurisdiction of the Agricultural Act of 2014, we entered into two separate agreements during 2015. We entered an agreement with the Kentucky State Department of Agriculture to complete research under pilot studies with farmers and processors of CBD. In addition, we entered into an agreement with the University of Kentucky to fund research regarding cultivation techniques to increase CBD production. We are also evaluating opportunities within Kentucky to invest in processing facilities and equipment in support of our consumer products business segment.
 
Market, Customers and Distribution Methods
 
The market, customers and distribution methods for hemp-based products are large and diverse. These markets range from hemp-based bio plastics to textiles. This is an ever-evolving distribution system that today includes early adopter retailers and ecommerce entities, and product development companies that use our PlusCBD™ brand oil to develop consumer products for distribution. The number of “mainstream” commercial and retail stores that currently stock and sell our products is increasing primarily through customer awareness. We believe that as awareness grows for the “green”, environmentally-friendly products derived from hemp/cannabis, the consumer market will adapt its current product lines to integrate them with hemp-based additives or replace harmful components in their existing products with the components of hemp.
 
Our target customers for our consumer product segment are first and foremost end consumers via internet sales, direct-to-consumer health and wellness stores, collectives, cooperatives, affiliate sales and master distributors. Secondarily, we are targeting manufacturers of products that can readily replace their raw base materials for our base materials, making the products more environmentally friendly and sustainable. In the future, we intend to target national and regional broker networks and major distribution companies who have preexisting relationships with major retail chain stores. In addition, we are directly pursuing distribution opportunities with national retailers. As we continue to develop our business, these markets may change, be re-prioritized or eliminated as management responds to consumer and regulatory developments.
 
Competition
 
There are several companies developing cannabinoid therapeutics for a range of medical indications. The cannabinoid therapeutic area currently includes formulated extracts of the Cannabis plant and synthetic formulations. These formulations include CBD and THC, or a combination of CBD/THC as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Certain companies such as GW Pharmaceuticals, PLC have focused on plant-based CBD formulations; while other companies such as Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Insys Therapeutics Inc. have focused on synthetic CBD formulations.
 
The CBD-based consumer product industry is highly fragmented with numerous companies, many of which are under-capitalized. We routinely evaluate internal and external opportunities to optimize value for shareholders through new product development or by asset acquisitions or sales. There are also large, well-funded companies that currently do not offer hemp-based consumer products but may do so in the future.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have filed trademark applications on our brands, logos and marks including, but not limited to CV Sciences and Plus CBD. On January 30, 2016, we received a Notice of Allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for our utility patent application number 14/791,184, Novel Process for Generating Hemp Oil with a High CBD Content. This patent covers our solvent-free and highly repeatable process for producing hemp oil with higher concentrations of CBD and expires in 2033.
 
We have a pending patent application for our product candidate CVSI-007 in the United States that will expire in 2036.
 
We review our intellectual property portfolio on a periodic basis and we will continue to broaden our portfolio in a fiscally prudent manner. We intend to file for patent protection on our pharmaceutical products based on proprietary formulations, processes and technology.
 
Research and Development
 
Our research and development costs have consisted primarily of salaries and related personnel expense, facilities and equipment expense and other costs related to both our consumer product and drug development business segments. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred in the ongoing development of new consumer products and in development of our drug candidate CVSI-007. We incurred research and development expenses of $0.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Source and Availability of Raw Materials
 
The Company has historically sourced raw materials from well-established and well-recognized hemp growers in Europe. We have maintained access to these growers for their raw material supply, and continue to explore and develop other relationships to ensure that we can meet the expected demand for bulk hemp products well into the future. Our current inventory levels are sufficient to support sales through 2019, resulting in reduced cash outflow for inventory purchases. The Company had two supply arrangements in place with European farmers to supply raw material through 2018, which have since been terminated. As such, we recorded an impairment expense of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, related to acquired goodwill and intangible assets from PhytoSPHERE Systems LLC (“PhytoSPHERE”) (See Note 6 of the Company’s consolidated financial statements). In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $3.6 million impairment of certain raw material inventory (See Note 3 of the Company’s consolidated financial statements).
Environmental Matters
 
Compliance with federal, state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had, nor are they expected to have, any material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company.
Employees
 
As of March 26, 2018, we had a total of 52 full-time employees. In addition to our full-time employees, we contract with third-parties for the conduct of certain preclinical, clinical and manufacturing activities related to drug development efforts. We do not currently have any part-time employees. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and none are represented by labor unions. Management believes the Company has good relationships with its employees.
