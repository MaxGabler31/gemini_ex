 Overview 
 We are a growing diagnostics company with proprietary molecular and bioinformatics technology that we are deploying to change the management of genetic disease worldwide. Our novel molecular assays reliably measure many informative regions across the genome from samples as small as a single cell. Our statistical algorithms combine these measurements with data available from the broader scientific community to identify genetic variations covering a wide range of serious conditions with best-in-class accuracy and coverage. Our goal is to develop and commercialize non- or minimally-invasive tests to evaluate risk, and thereby enable early detection, for a wide range of genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome. Our technology has been proven clinically and commercially in the prenatal testing space. We have begun translating this success into the liquid biopsy space, where we are leveraging our core expertise to develop products for oncology diagnostic applications, initially for research use and which we are developing as a CLIA test. We seek to enable even wider adoption of our technology through our global cloud-based distribution model. In addition to our direct sales force in the United States, we have a global network of close to 90 laboratory and distribution partners, including many of the largest international laboratories. 
 Since 2009 we have launched a comprehensive suite of ten products in women’s health and prenatal testing – nine molecular diagnostic tests and a newborn stem cell banking offering to complement our prenatal testing portfolio – and our personalized liquid biopsy technology for research use only in oncology applications. We intend to continue to launch new products in the future.
 We launched Panorama, our non-invasive prenatal test, or NIPT, in March 2013 and have since gone from being the fourth company to enter the NIPT market to being the market leader by volume in the United States. Panorama represented approximately 63% of our revenues, with approximately 343,700 Panorama tests accessioned, during the year ended December 31, 2017. Our revenues were $210.9 million in 2017, compared to $217.1 million in 2016 and $190.4 million in 2015. Our net losses increased to $136.3 million in 2017 from $95.8 million in 2016 and $70.3 million in 2015. 
 In both prenatal testing and oncology, the use of blood-based diagnostic tests offers significant advantages over older methods, but the significant technological challenge is that such testing requires the measurement of very small amounts of relevant genetic material circulating within a much larger blood sample. Our approach combines proprietary molecular biology and computational techniques to measure genomic variations in tiny amounts of DNA, as small as a single cell. Our molecular biology techniques are based on measuring thousands of SNPs simultaneously using mmPCR to multiplex, or target, many thousands of regions of the genome simultaneously in a single test reaction. Our method avoids losing molecules, which can happen when samples are split into separate reaction tubes, so that all relevant variants can be detected. We believe our approach represents a fundamental advance in molecular biology. This approach is distinct from the approach employed with other commercially available NIPTs, which use first-generation “quantitative”, or counting, methods to compare the relative number of sequence reads from a chromosome of interest to a reference chromosome. Based on extensive data published in the journals Obstetrics & Gynecology, the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Prenatal Diagnosis, and others, we believe Panorama is the most accurate NIPT commercially available in the United States.
 Our Solution 
 Genetic inheritance is conveyed through DNA, a naturally occurring information storage system. DNA stores information in a linear sequence of the chemical bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine, represented by the symbols A, C, G, and T. Billions of bases of A, C, G, and T link together inside living cells to form the genome, which can be read

like a code or a molecular blueprint for life. While differences in the specific sequence and structure of this code drive biological diversity, certain variations can also cause disease. Examples of genetic diversity include CNVs and SNVs. A CNV is a genetic mutation in which relatively large regions of the genome have been deleted or duplicated, and an SNV is a mutation where a single base has changed. When single base changes are common in the population, that position on the chromosome, or loci, is called a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP.
 To make sense of this deep and rich set of biological data and deliver a diagnosis, we have developed computationally intensive algorithms that combine the data generated by mmPCR with the ever-expanding set of publicly available data on genetic variations. Our technology is compatible with standard equipment used globally and a range of NGS platforms, and we have optimized our algorithms to enable laboratories around the world to run tests locally and access our algorithms in the cloud. 
 We believe that our mmPCR technology and proprietary algorithms, which have been proven in the context of NIPT, can be a powerful tool in oncology applications such as recurrence monitoring and therapy response monitoring. In oncology, we have demonstrated our ability to detect both CNVs and SNVs from very low concentrations of tumor DNA circulating in a blood sample, or ctDNA. Our technology was featured on the cover of the May 2017 issue of Nature, which highlighted our performance in detecting relapse early, and predicting patient response to adjuvant therapy, in patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer. Because lung, ovarian and breast cancer are driven, to varying degrees, by a combination of CNVs, SNVs and gene fusions, we believe that our approach is well-suited for recurrence monitoring and therapy selection for these cancers. In August 2017, we launched SignateraTM (RUO), our first offering for oncology, for research use only, and we are working on developing this technology as a CLIA test. Signatera is a personalized ctDNA technology that analyzes mutations specific to an individual’s tumor sample, enabling the custom design of assays specific to that individual as well as high sensitivity and specificity in detecting and monitoring the presence of ctDNA.
 Our technologies allow us to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio when detecting fragments of DNA from samples as small as a single cell, which allows us to deliver screening tests with differentiated specificity, sensitivity, and coverage. From a single blood draw, our current prenatal commercial tests assess the risk of a broad range of conditions, which we refer to as "coverage," including common fetal aneuploidies, microdeletions, triploidy, and inherited genetic conditions that could be passed on from parent to child. We sell our tests directly and partner with other clinical laboratories to distribute our tests globally. Currently, all of our products other than our Constellation cloud software product and our Evercord newborn stem cell banking offering are LDTs. We perform commercial testing in our CLIA-certified laboratory. 
 An illustration of the resolution that can be achieved with our mmPCR capability is provided below. The figures display data from our approximately 20,000 primer mmPCR assay, where each assay targets one SNP. On the left, the assay is applied to a large genomic DNA sample from a child. On the right, the assay is applied to a single cell from the same child. Each dot represents data from a particular SNP location on a chromosome. The assay measures the amount of each of the two possible sequences of nucleotides, or alleles, at each SNP. The plots below show the relative proportion of the two alleles, plotted along the vertical axis, for each of the approximately 20,000 SNPs, arranged sequentially along the vertical axis. The two alleles are arbitrarily labeled A and B, and each dot is colored according to the allelic contribution of the mother—red (A) or blue (B). Those SNPs where both copies of DNA in the child contain only the A allele are red and are found at the very top of the plot, and those SNPs where both copies of DNA in the child contain only the B allele are blue and are found at the very bottom of the plot. The SNPs where the fetus contains at least one copy of the A allele and one copy of the B allele are found near the center of the plot. The four vertical bars separated by dotted lines display data from chromosomes 13, 18, 21 and X. For chromosomes 13, 18 and X, the middle band is centered on 0.5; which indicates that for those SNPs, the child has one copy of the A allele and one copy of a B allele (and therefore a relative proportion of 0.5), and, therefore, has the right number of chromosomes—two. In this sample, an additional chromosome is present at chromosome 21, which indicates the presence of trisomy 21. For chromosome 21, the bands centered at 0.33 and 0.66 signal the additional nucleotides contributed by the mother. The band centered at 0.33 represents SNPs where the child has two copies of the B allele and one copy of the A allele, and the band centered at 0.66 represents SNPs where the child has two copies of the A allele and one copy of the B allele. The assay clearly quantifies the difference between single molecules of a particular allele at each SNP. The images demonstrate our ability to derive actionable information from tiny quantities of DNA, as the data from a single cell in the image on the right is nearly as informative as the data from a large genomic sample in the image on the left.

Our proprietary innovations in both molecular biology and bioinformatics drive performance of our current tests and our development pipeline. Our mmPCR technology optimizes the behavior of primers in a reaction to generate a high-resolution measurement of thousands of DNA loci in patient samples. As a result, we can capture mutations from a single DNA fragment within a large background of extraneous DNA found in a patient's blood sample. We believe our molecular technology has the potential to enable a broad range of applications in prenatal diagnostics and cancer. For example, the ability to target primers in a specific area of chromosome 22 allows our prenatal microdeletions panel to assess the risk of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which is caused by the deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22, with demonstrated higher sensitivity and specificity than other commercially available tests. If identified during pregnancy, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome can be treated with early intervention at the time of birth to avoid seizures and reduce cognitive impairment.

      Our bioinformatics technology complements our molecular technology to deliver a risk assessment with high sensitivity and specificity. We use proprietary statistical techniques to combine the measurements of our molecular assays with our internal databases and the vast and growing sources of publicly available genomic information to build highly detailed models of the genome of interest. This process includes the use of a statistical technique known as maximum likelihood estimation, or MLE, which is widely used in other industries, such as in the conversion of a noisy transmitted analog communications signal to a digital format. However, it is computationally complex to leverage this technique to combine genomic information from the patient's sample and information from the databases of the broader scientific community. We have issued U.S. patents claiming methods to do so and pending applications in the United States and abroad. We also maintain trade secrets on our processes and practices. Our proprietary solution using MLE enables us to continuously improve the performance of our existing tests and efficiently develop new ones. As our patient volumes grow, our internal database of samples with genetic mutations and corresponding clinical outcomes further enhances our ability to interpret the clinical significance of complex genetic mutations. As the genomic data from the scientific community, such as from the Cosmic Database and the Cancer Genome Atlas, becomes richer, we can seamlessly integrate new clinical knowledge into our bioinformatics algorithm, driving further improvement in our tests. 
 Panorama
 We launched our Panorama NIPT in 2013, our microdeletions panel for Panorama in 2014 and our twins, egg donor, and surrogate screening capabilities in 2017. Panorama demonstrates the capabilities of our technology by employing our fundamentally unique approach of simultaneously measuring thousands of SNPs in a single test reaction to identify genetic variations in fetal DNA with a high degree of specificity and sensitivity. 
 Panorama helps physicians assess the risk of fetal genetic abnormalities by non-invasively screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome, Patau syndrome, Turner syndrome and triploidy, which often result in intellectual disability, severe organ abnormalities and miscarriage. Panorama can also identify fetal sex for single birth pregnancies as well as the gender of each fetus in twin pregnancies. Panorama is also the only commercially available NIPT that can determine whether a set of twins is identical, or monozygotic, or fraternal, or dizygotic. Identifying a monozygotic twin pregnancy can prompt earlier, targeted ultrasound assessments for chorionicity and associated complications, while knowing that a twin pregnancy is dizygotic reduces concerns about certain complications, such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome. 
 Panorama is performed on a maternal blood sample and can be performed as early as nine weeks into a pregnancy, which is significantly earlier than traditional methods, such as serum protein measurement whereby doctors measure the presence and amount of certain hormones in the blood. Panorama starts with a simple blood draw from the mother, either in a doctor's office, in a laboratory or through a phlebotomist that may travel to the patient, and the sample is sent to our CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratory in California. We extract DNA from each sample, amplify the specific SNPs that we are interested in measuring, and then sequence the DNA using NGS. Using our proprietary bioinformatics 

 
  8

 
technology, we analyze the DNA sequences to assess the state of the fetal genome, focusing on the SNP data, while incorporating public information from the Human Genome Project. Our bioinformatics algorithm builds billions of detailed models of the potential genetic state of the sample to determine the most likely diagnosis. After Panorama generates its result, we provide the doctor or the laboratory with a simple report showing the risk that abnormalities are present in the fetus. In 2017, we averaged approximately 98.5% of Panorama results delivered within ten calendar days after we received the blood sample. 
 The analytic and clinical validity of our technology demonstrated in Panorama and our other products has been described in multiple peer-reviewed publications, including the journals Clinical Embryology, Translational Oncology, Human Reproduction, Molecular Human Reproduction, Fertility and Sterility, PLOS ONE, Genetics in Medicine, Prenatal Diagnosis, Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy, Obstetrics & Gynecology, Genome Medicine, and American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. Based on data published in Prenatal Diagnosis, Fetal Diagnosis and Therapy and Obstetrics & Gynecology, Panorama demonstrated greater than 99% overall sensitivity for aneuploidies on chromosomes 13, 18 and 21 and triploidy and specificity of greater than 99.9% (less than 0.1% false positive rate) for each disorder, which we believe makes it overall the most accurate NIPT commercially available in the United States. A paper published in the August 2014 issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology reported that Panorama had a statistically significant lower false positive rate than other NIPT methods practiced by our U.S. competitors. Based on data published in Obstetrics & Gynecology, Prenatal Diagnosis, and American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, we have also demonstrated the ability to identify fetal sex more accurately than competing NIPTs. This is partially a result of Panorama's unique ability to detect a vanishing twin, which is a known driver of fetal sex errors with quantitative methods used by our competitors. The October 2014 issue of the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology noted that the ability of Panorama to identify additional fetal haplotypes is expected to result in fewer false positive calls and prevent incorrect fetal sex calls. A study reporting on the use of Panorama in over 30,000 women, published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, supported the use of NIPT as a first-line screening test for aneuploidy.
 We believe Panorama's specificity and sensitivity can give patients and their physicians a greater degree of comfort in choosing to forego unnecessary invasive procedures, limiting the resulting risk of spontaneous miscarriage associated with invasive procedures and lowering the total cost to the healthcare system of these procedures.
 Panorama screens for common genetic conditions that affect both high-risk pregnancies, where maternal age is over 35 and which represent over 800,000 pregnancies in the United States, and average-risk pregnancies, which represent approximately 3.3 million pregnancies in the United States. By recognizing early on the importance of NIPT to average-risk pregnancies and maintaining a focus on this market, we are strategically positioned to capitalize on what we believe will be increased penetration and reimbursement of NIPT in all risk categories. NIPT has not historically been well reimbursed for the average-risk population; however, commercial payers representing over half of all commercial covered lives in the United States now have a positive coverage determination for NIPT for average-risk pregnancies, and we believe that this momentum will continue consistent with the growing consensus among physicians, professional societies, and third-party payers that NIPT is an appropriate screening tool for all pregnant women. ACMG is the most recent professional society that has advocated for broader adoption of NIPT, including recommending informing pregnant women that NIPT is the most sensitive screening option for Patau, Edwards and Down syndromes, as well as of the availability of the expanded use of NIPT to screen for clinically relevant CNVs in the context of counseling that includes the risks/benefits and limitations of screening for CNVs. Furthermore, we believe that data from our DNAFirst study, showing that NIPT can be effectively and appropriately offered as a primary screen for all pregnant women regardless of risk due to maternal age or other factors, will be particularly important in driving further progress in average-risk NIPT reimbursement. These results were published in January 2017 in Genetics in Medicine. As part of this trial, we ran the Panorama test on over 2,600 pregnant women through Women and Infants Hospital in Rhode Island. DNAFirst was the first study demonstrating routine clinical use of cfDNA-based prenatal screening for common aneuploidies in a general U.S. population, offered through primary obstetric care providers.
 Our Panorama microdeletions panel screens for five of the most common genetic diseases caused by microdeletions – 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (Di George syndrome), 1p36 deletion, Angelman syndrome, Cri-du-chat syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome. Microdeletions are missing sub-chromosomal pieces of DNA, and can have serious health implications depending on the location of the deletion. Unlike Down syndrome, where the risk increases with 

 
  9

 
maternal age, the risk of these five microdeletions is independent of maternal age. Based on data published in Prenatal Diagnosis and American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, the combined prevalence of these targeted microdeletions is approximately one in 1,000 pregnancies, which collectively makes them more common than Down syndrome for women younger than approximately 28 years of age. Diseases caused by microdeletions are often not detected via common screening techniques such as ultrasound or hormone-based screening, yet the presence of a microdeletion can critically impact postnatal treatment. For example, when learning prior to birth that a newborn has 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, doctors will know to deliver calcium to the infant to avoid seizures and permanent cognitive impairment and will know to avoid administering routine vaccinations due to the immunodeficiency frequently associated with this condition. The Panorama microdeletions panel has conditional approval from the New York State Department of Health.
 Panorama has demonstrated best-in-class performance screening for microdeletions. Panorama achieved sensitivity of 90% for deletions of approximately 2.9Mb for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, based on a validation study that contained 10 positives. It has also been validated to perform at low fetal fractions, which refers to the percentage of fetal DNA in a maternal plasma sample. Based on data published in the February 2018 issue of Clinical Genetics, Panorama demonstrated a PPV of 44.2% and false positive rate of 0.07% for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. We are also conducting a SNP-based Microdeletions and Aneuploidy RegisTry (SMART) study to evaluate the performance of SNP-based NIPT for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome by tracking birth outcomes in the general population among women who present clinically and elect Panorama microdeletion and aneuploidy screening as part of their routine care. We have enrolled more than 12,000 of the 20,000 total anticipated patients in this study. We expect to review perinatal medical records and collect postnatal DNA in order to perform genetic diagnostic testing for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Results from the follow-up specimens will be compared to those obtained by the Panorama screening test to determine test performance, particularly PPV.
 The graph below summarizes the incidence of genetic diseases for which prenatal screening is relatively common, as well as the incidence of genetic diseases caused by microdeletions that are screened by the Panorama microdeletions panel. Incidence rates are higher than that of many commonly tested disorders, such as Cystic Fibrosis and Spinal Muscular Atrophy. We estimate that triploidy and the aneuploidy and microdeletion conditions that we screen for combined are 

 
  10

 
more than three times as prevalent in the general population as the three most common autosomal aneuploidies, trisomies 13 (Patau syndrome), 18 (Edwards syndrome), and 21 (Down syndrome), alone.

 The graph below demonstrates how the relative incidence of Down syndrome and genetic diseases caused by the microdeletions screened for by the Panorama microdeletions panel varies with maternal age.

 3Hall, PanoramaTM Non-Invasive Prenatal Screening for Microdeletion Syndromes. 2013.
     Because the microdeletions that we screen for are more common at birth than fetal aneuploidies for children born to younger women, and based on the performance of Panorama on microdeletions, we believe our microdeletions testing capability is a significant driver of Panorama adoption in all risk categories, including those who are traditionally considered average-risk. We intend to continue to work closely with physicians, medical societies, payers, patient advocacy groups such as the International 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome Foundation, Inc., and our laboratory partners to demonstrate that Panorama's sensitivity and specificity across a range of chromosomal abnormalities and superior false positive rates, coupled with disease coverage for conditions for which prevalence does not vary with maternal age, represent a compelling case for a continued shift towards broad adoption in the average-risk population. 
 Furthermore, we believe that we are well-positioned for what we anticipate will be stable reimbursement for NIPT for microdeletions over the long term. A CPT code for use in billing and reimbursement for microdeletions testing went into effect in January 2017, and CMS provided a pricing benchmark for aneuploidy and microdeletions testing. See “—Reimbursement.” Since several Medicaid programs haven't yet priced aneuploidy testing, we expect the pricing of aneuploidy set by CMS will increase the number of Medicaid programs that price the test and may result in Medicaid plans pricing microdeletions testing at a faster pace. In addition, although most commercial insurances have already priced aneuploidy testing, the price established by CMS for microdeletions testing can serve as a relevant benchmark for pricing discussions with commercial insurance plans to begin reimbursement for microdeletions testing. Our microdeletions reimbursement has been, and we expect that it will, at least in the near term, remain low under the CPT code, either due to reduced reimbursement or third-party payers declining to reimburse under the code; however, we believe that growing recognition from professional societies, combined with the performance of our microdeletions test and the additional 

 
  12

 
validation data from our SMART study that we expect to report on the sensitivity and specificity of our tests, will drive broader reimbursement in the future. 
 Panorama is also validated to screen twin pregnancies, as well as egg donor and surrogate pregnancies. Our unique SNP technology makes Panorama the only commercially available NIPT that can distinguish between each twin’s DNA, and therefore can determine zygosity, or whether the twins are identical or fraternal, and the fetal sex of each twin. Determining zygosity early in a pregnancy can help guide the management of a pregnancy, as certain monozygotic, or identical twin, pregnancies are at higher risk for various complications such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome, where there is an unequal sharing of blood, and therefore unequal growth, between the twins. Panorama screens twin pregnancies for Down, Edwards and Patau syndromes and, for identical twins, Turner syndrome and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. In validation studies, Panorama identified identical twins with >99% sensitivity and specificity and achieved a combined sensitivity of >99% and specificity of >99% for Down, Edwards and Patau syndromes in twin pregnancies.
 Since launching Panorama, we have implemented various updates to both the molecular and computational portions of Panorama, continuing to improve performance and efficiency, and reduce the cost of running the test, for example by incorporating screening for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in our base Panorama panel. Previous updates have significantly reduced Panorama’s no-call rate, improved sensitivity at lower fetal fractions, and simplified sample collection for clinics, and we’ve improved our microdeletions testing protocol to increase PPVs and reduce false positive rates. In validation studies, Panorama has demonstrated greater than 99% sensitivity and specificity for Down syndrome, and a combined sensitivity and specificity of greater than 99% across Down, Edwards, Patau and Turner syndromes. Furthermore, Panorama continues to maintain the highest commercially available sensitivity (90%) for deletions of approximately 2.9Mb for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, based on a validation study that contained 10 positives.
 Panorama's commercial performance has been consistent with our initial validation data. Data published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology on 28,739 commercial cases of Panorama that were screened for Down, Edwards, Patau and Turner syndromes demonstrated an overall PPV of 83% for all indications combined. We believe Panorama's performance in commercial practice represents a significant improvement over first-generation NIPTs that rely on quantitative methods. Because Panorama does not require a reference chromosome, it is uniquely able to detect triploidy as well as full molar pregnancies. Panorama’s ability to differentiate between maternal and fetal DNA also allows Panorama to identify the presence of a vanishing twin, as well as maternal abnormalities, which have been shown in multiple studies to lead to false positives when using quantitative methods, particularly in the sex chromosomes where maternal abnormalities are common.
 Panorama has demonstrated substantial commercial success to date. We believe our test performance has allowed us to command a price premium compared to low-cost NIPTs while continuing to maintain growth in volume and revenue from Panorama.

 Horizon
 We launched our Horizon carrier screening test in 2012. Horizon helps couples determine if they are carriers of genetic mutations that cause specific diseases. If both parents are carriers for a specific disease, it could result in a child affected with the disease. Many people do not know they are a carrier for an inherited genetic disease until they have an affected child. These diseases are rare and usually there is no family history, although certain disorders are more common in certain ethnic groups. However, ethnicity may no longer be a reliable predictor of carrier status, as patients are increasingly of mixed or uncertain ethnicities. Accordingly, the industry’s approach to carrier screening has evolved over time, from ethnic-based screening targeting specific ethnicities with a higher incidence of screened conditions, to pan-ethnic screening for certain recommended conditions available to all patients, and most recently to expanded screening for many conditions simultaneously. In early 2017, ACOG expanded its guidelines on carrier screening, recommending universal screening for Spinal Muscular Atrophy in addition to Cystic Fibrosis, as many genetic conditions are not limited to any specific ethnic group, and providing guidance on expanded carrier screening. 
 Horizon was created based on recommended screening guidelines from ACOG, ACMG, and the Victor Center for the Prevention of Jewish Genetic Diseases. Horizon screens for up to 274 inherited diseases, including Cystic Fibrosis, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, or DMD, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Fragile X Syndrome and other conditions. Most conditions on the Horizon panel are autosomal recessive disorders, which means that both parents must be carriers for their children to be at risk. Some conditions are X-linked disorders, which are inherited from a mother who is a carrier and primarily affect male children. If both partners are carriers for the same recessive genetic disease, the couple has a 25% chance of having an affected child in each pregnancy. If a woman is a carrier of an X-linked disease, she has up to a 50% chance of having an affected child in each pregnancy. DMD, an X-linked condition, affects approximately 1/3500 male births, an incidence similar to Cystic Fibrosis and to Fragile X Syndrome in males. DMD is the most common muscular dystrophy in children and affects families of all ethnicities. Approximately 2/3 of clinically diagnosed cases of DMD are attributable to a carrier mother, who is likely unaware that she is a carrier. In addition to providing information about reproductive risks, carrier screening can identify women who are, themselves, at risk of health effects caused by defects in the DMD gene.
 The blood or saliva sample required for Horizon can be obtained simultaneously with the blood sample required for Panorama, which makes it easier for us to offer, and for patients to take, both tests. Horizon employs various methodologies, including next generation sequencing and copy number analysis, often in combination in order to increase test sensitivity, to analyze the DNA from the individual’s blood or saliva sample to determine if the individual is a carrier for the genetic diseases being screened. Horizon test results are generally returned to the ordering physician in ten to 14 business days from the day we receive the sample, depending on the number of conditions the patient has requested to be screened.
 Our Other Products
 Vistara
 We launched Vistara, an NIPT that screens for single-gene disorders across 30 genes, in 2017. Vistara is a complement to Panorama, and screens for severe skeletal, cardiac and neurological conditions which are often associated with cognitive disabilities or require surgical intervention. The conditions screened by Vistara have a combined incidence of approximately 1 in 600, which is higher than that of Down syndrome as well as Cystic Fibrosis, and are associated with advanced paternal age. Other NIPTs do not screen for these conditions, and prenatal ultrasounds may either fail to detect these disorders or the disorders may not present until much later in the pregnancy, after birth or even into childhood. Furthermore, family history is not a good indicator of risk for these conditions, which are commonly caused by de novo, or new and not inherited, mutations. Screening for these conditions early in the pregnancy can facilitate early diagnosis, enable patients to be referred to MFMs and other specialists for targeted evaluations, guide labor and delivery management, and allow families to mobilize resources, ask questions and anticipate future needs.
 In validation studies, Vistara demonstrated a combined analytical sensitivity and analytical specificity of greater than 99%.

 Other reproductive health products
 Our preimplantation genetic screening, or PGS, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis, or PGD, tests, which we market under the Spectrum brand, are for couples undergoing IVF. Spectrum can improve the chance of a successful pregnancy while reducing the chance of miscarriage or of having a child with a chromosome condition, by helping to identify the healthiest embryos during an IVF cycle. Our PGS test screens embryos for the number of chromosomes and for extra or missing pieces of chromosomes prior to transfer of embryos created through IVF procedures, which have a high rate of non-viable chromosomal abnormalities, known as aneuploidy. This allows IVF physicians to select and transfer embryos with normal chromosome results. Combined with single embryo transfer, PGS has been shown to increase the rate of implantation and decrease the time to pregnancy, while reducing the risks of a multiple pregnancy, miscarriage or an aneuploid pregnancy, and may reduce the need for multiple costly IVF cycles. Our PGD test is for couples identified to be at risk for having a child with an inherited genetic disorder. This test is customized for each individual’s mutation to determine whether an embryo is affected with, a carrier for, or unaffected from the tested disease. Spectrum incorporates our proprietary technology to further screen for extra or missing sets of chromosomes and uniparental disomy, in which two copies of a chromosome come from the same parent; confirm parentage; and determine the parental origin of the chromosomal abnormality. 
 Anora is our products of conception, or POC, test, which analyzes miscarriage tissue from women who have experienced one or more pregnancy losses to determine whether there was an underlying chromosomal reason for the loss. The Anora test is helpful to obstetricians, gynecologists and IVF physicians in supporting their patients’ reproductive goals. Anora can help couples understand the likelihood of another miscarriage, their future reproductive options, and whether there are any steps that may help them avoid a miscarriage in future pregnancies. 
 Our non-invasive prenatal paternity product allows a couple to safely establish paternity without waiting for the child to be born. Testing can be done as early as nine weeks in gestation using a blood draw from the pregnant mother and alleged father. Our internal data indicates that the accuracy of this test is greater than 99.99%. We have licensed this technology to a third party to perform the test in its clinical laboratory. 
 Constellation
 Our Constellation software forms the core of our cloud-based distribution model. Through this model, we have been able to expand access to our molecular and bioinformatics capabilities worldwide, enabling laboratories, under a license from us, to run the molecular workflows themselves and then access our computation-intensive bioinformatics algorithms through Constellation, which runs in the cloud, to analyze the results. As of March 1, 2018, 12 licensees are using our Constellation platform commercially, including 1 in NIPT and one in prenatal paternity testing. We have licensing contracts with various other laboratories in the United States and internationally to develop products in both NIPT and oncology. Our licensees are in various stages of development and implementation of an NIPT product. We leverage Constellation to enhance adoption of our tests among laboratory licensees globally, and to perform our internal commercial laboratory activities and research and development of our products.
 We have received CE Marks from the European Commission for our Constellation software and for the key reagents that our laboratory licensees need to run their portion of the Panorama test prior to accessing our algorithms through Constellation. These CE Marks enable us to offer Constellation in the European Union and other countries that accept a CE Mark. We are pursuing other regulatory approvals, as needed, to allow the international roll out of Constellation in regions that do not accept a CE Mark.
 We believe that our cloud-based distribution model provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to, among others, accelerate international adoption by leveraging our licensees’ existing capabilities, efficiently achieve scale, and reduce costs.

 Evercord
 We launched Evercord, a private cord blood and tissue banking service, in 2017. This offering enables expecting parents to collect, store and potentially retrieve their newborn’s stem cells for therapeutic use in transplantation and regenerative medicine applications for the child or related family members. Cord blood, which is the blood contained in the placental blood vessels and umbilical cord, contains HPCs, which are the blood-forming stem cells that are routinely used to treat patients with cancers such as leukemia or lymphoma, and other disorders of the blood and immune systems. Other sources of HPCs include bone marrow and peripheral blood, which is blood circulating in the body. Scientific literature has shown that in successful transplants, cord blood HPCs may not require as exact a match as HPCs from bone marrow or the bloodstream do, and, as a result, there is a higher chance of finding a cord blood stem cell match for transplant. Cord tissue, which is the tissue surrounding the umbilical vein and blood vessels in the umbilical cord, contains mesenchymal stem cells, or MSCs. MSCs can inhibit inflammation following tissue damage, secrete growth factors that aid in tissue repair, and develop into many different cell types such as bone, cartilage, muscle and nerve cells. Although there are no proven medical treatments currently available using cord tissue or MSCs, MSCs have the potential to treat more conditions than HPCs alone, such as heart disease, Parkinson’s disease and lung cancer. Published data suggests that one in three people in the United States, or 128 million people, could potentially benefit from regenerative medicine applications of cord blood and tissue if they are proven effective. More than 300 clinical trials involving cord blood and tissue stem cells are currently underway, including studies focused on regenerative medicine. More than 30,000 cord blood stem cell treatments have been conducted worldwide. Based on the advances in research focused on stem cells and regenerative medicine, it is anticipated that number may continue to grow. 
 We believe that our Evercord offering is a natural extension of our mission and our experience in genetic testing, and ties in well to our other offerings. Our Horizon carrier screening test includes 35 of the nearly 80 diseases for which cord blood stem cell treatment has been administered. This complementary product offering also allows us to optimize our sales and marketing strategy and engage with potential customers earlier than our competitors in this space, through our patient and provider interactions early in the pregnancy facilitated by our NIPT and carrier screening offerings. 
 Our Evercord service was created in partnership with Bloodworks Northwest, or Bloodworks, which operates a public cord blood bank at one of only seven FDA-licensed cord blood banking facilities. Bloodworks has 20 years of cord blood banking experience and has released nearly 1,000 cord blood units for transplants. Under our service agreement with Bloodworks, Bloodworks performs processing and infectious disease testing services on blood samples submitted by Evercord customers and cryo-preserves the cord blood and tissue samples at its Seattle, Washington-based storage facility. We believe that Evercord will be well positioned to leverage our established commercial capabilities because we already engage with potential Evercord customers through our offering of Panorama and Horizon products. Also, we believe we can establish a relationship and level of familiarity and trust through our patient portal and healthcare provider digital services through Natera Connect, which puts us at a competitive advantage over other cord blood banking providers.
 Oncology
 We believe that our ability to interrogate genes at tens of thousands of loci in parallel in a single reaction at the scale of a single molecule is well suited to the analysis of cancer-associated genetic mutations in circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA. In oncology applications such as recurrence monitoring and therapy monitoring, many loci must be interrogated simultaneously without splitting a sample, and achieving sensitivity to tiny amounts of tumor DNA as low as a single molecule is important. We are working towards commercializing non-invasive oncology diagnostic products designed to measure cancer recurrence and disease load monitoring, guide therapy selection and screen for cancer in high-risk populations. We are initially focused on recurrence monitoring in lung cancer and other cancers, and are exploring various candidates for recurrence monitoring as well as reflex testing, recurrence and disease load monitoring, and early detection screening in breast cancer.  To guide prognosis, predict relapse and assist in therapeutic decision-making, we may in the future develop a panel which would include known recurrent alterations that, when identified in blood at low levels, may indicate a residual presence of cancer that can remain in the patient after treatment and during remission. The panel would be used to detect variants from the initial tumor's molecular signature in low levels of ctDNA in blood prior to the appearance of clinical symptoms in order to assist in guiding earlier decisions regarding clinical management.

 We have demonstrated that our mmPCR platform can provide highly accurate detection of CNVs and SNVs in the plasma from patients with cancer. In a study published in the October 2015 issue of Translational Oncology, we demonstrated the ability of our mmPCR platform to detect CNVs in plasma with DNA concentrations of under 1%, compared to other sequencing methods which require DNA concentrations of at least 4%, for samples with a single deletion or duplication event in a given loci. We believe that our ability to simultaneously detect both CNVs and SNVs in ctDNA at very low concentrations in standard plasma samples drives our potential opportunity in the oncology diagnostics space. 
 Signatera (RUO)
 In 2017 we launched Signatera (RUO), our first oncology offering, for research use only to oncology researchers and biopharmaceutical companies. Signatera (RUO) is a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) technology that analyzes and tracks mutations specific to an individual’s tumor in the bloodstream. The first step in the test analyzes the tumor tissue to determine the tumor signature, or which mutations are most likely to be present when the tumor is present, and then designs custom assays that target those mutations. Signatera (RUO) can screen for an average of 16 different mutations, significantly more than the less than five mutations that are generally detectable with other currently available liquid biopsy tests, which screen for a generic set of mutations independent of an individual's tumor. This results in a higher probability of detecting tumor DNA in a given individual’s plasma and, therefore, higher clinical sensitivity. Additionally, our technology is able to detect mutations at concentrations as low as 0.01% fraction of cell-free DNA, further contributing to high sensitivity; and due to the high number of detectable mutations, can achieve high specificity by requiring detection of multiple mutations in order to deliver a positive test result. We expect to commercialize this technology for clinical use as an LDT in our own CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratory in 2018.
 Our technology was selected for use in Cancer Research UK/University College London’s Tracking Cancer Evolution through Therapy (TRACERx) clinical trial for the multi-year monitoring of patient-specific SNVs in plasma, to understand the evolution of cancer mutations over time, and to monitor patients for disease recurrence. Results from the first 100 early-stage lung cancer patients analyzed as part of the study were featured on the cover of the May 2017 issue of Nature and showed that an early version of Signatera (RUO) identified 43% more ctDNA-positive early-stage lung cancer cases than a generic lung cancer panel and demonstrated its potential to detect residual disease, measure treatment response, and identify recurrence up to 11 months earlier than the standard of care. 
 Other research collaborations in oncology
 We are working with world-renowned oncology centers on research collaborations and clinical trials to explore applications in various cancer types and stages of diagnostic intervention for which we believe our performance in the detection of CNVs, SNVs, and gene fusions will allow us to achieve a competitive advantage.
 We are participating in research collaborations with Aarhus University in Denmark to evaluate ctDNA as a useful biomarker in the diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer, and for detecting minimal residual disease, treatment response, and disease recurrence in colorectal cancer patients. We will design custom assays for each individual and perform ctDNA analysis on prospectively obtained plasma samples at multiple time points to correlate ctDNA levels with clinical outcomes for patients who have undergone treatment for bladder cancer and whose blood was collected serially throughout chemotherapy and surgery. We will also perform ctDNA analysis, utilizing individual-specific assays, on blood samples of patients who have undergone surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer, with the objective of determining the relationship between post-surgical ctDNA levels, minimal residual disease, disease relapse, and adjuvant therapeutic response. 
 We are also partnering with Cancer Research UK-funded researchers at Imperial College London and the University of Leicester, U.K. in a study to evaluate retrospectively and determine the sensitivity, specificity, lead time, and utility of ctDNA to detect disease recurrence in women breast cancer patients. 
 We have been participating in the Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging and Molecular Analysis 2 (I-SPY 2) trial with the University of California, San Francisco and QuantumLeap Healthcare Collaborative. This trial was launched in 2010 and is a multi-center study evaluating the safety and efficacy of 

 
  17

 
investigational therapies combined with early treatment in women with newly diagnosed, locally advanced breast cancer. As part of this trial, we will analyze blood samples at various points throughout patient treatment to evaluate the effectiveness of liquid biopsy in monitoring tumor burden, treatment response, and residual disease, as compared to traditional imaging methods.
 Direct Sales Force and Global Distribution Network 
 Through our direct sales efforts and worldwide network of close to 90 laboratory and distribution partners, we have established a broad distribution channel. Our own direct sales force and managed care teams, which include approximately 140 genetics-focused sales representatives, anchor our commercial engagement with physicians, laboratory partners, and payers, and sell directly to MFMs, OB/GYNs, physicians or physician practices, IVF centers, or integrated health systems. In the NIPT market, Panorama is typically ordered for a patient by an MFM or OB/GYN. There are over 37,000 OB/GYNs in the United States and most of them practice generalist medicine for women's health. They typically only assist women with average risk pregnancies and will refer women with high risk pregnancies to one of the more than 2,000 MFMs in the United States. We believe that Panorama will continue to be adopted by physicians for broader use in average risk pregnancies, and therefore anticipate that an increasing proportion of Panorama orders in the future will come from OB/GYNs.
 Where our sales force can access physician offices directly, as in the U.S. market, we are able to maximize cross-selling opportunities by offering the full portfolio of our products. For example, we are promoting the use of Panorama NIPT, our Panorama microdeletions panel, and Horizon together for pregnant women who have not had a CS test at the time they are ready to have an NIPT performed. These tests can all be run using one blood draw from the mother and can be ordered on one requisition form and with one shipment of the patient’s samples by the physician. Also, because of the importance and demand for screening for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, we have included that feature as part of our basic Panorama panel, unless the patient or physician ordering the test opts out of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome screen. In the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 74% of customers who ordered the basic Panorama panel directly from us also ordered screening for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome or the full microdeletions panel, and approximately 30% of customers who ordered Panorama directly from us also ordered Horizon carrier screening.
 In our Evercord business, in addition to promoting to physician practices directly through our sales force, we have a unique opportunity to engage with potential Evercord customers early in their pregnancies as we build a relationship with them through our prenatal tests. We are able to leverage this early engagement to sell newborn stem cell banking directly to our existing patients. Other cord blood service providers typically market to potential customers much later in pregnancy.

We generate a higher gross margin when we sell testing services directly, compared to when our products are distributed by laboratory partners to be performed at our CLIA-certified laboratory. The percentage of our revenues generated through the higher margin U.S. direct sales force channel increased to approximately 83% in 2017, from approximately 78% in 2016 and approximately 77% in 2015. In January 2017, we terminated our licensing and distribution agreement with Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc., or Bio-Reference, a laboratory distribution partner that accounted for approximately 8% of our revenues in 2016, and began directly servicing the accounts that were previously ordering through Bio-Reference.
 In addition to our sales force, we market to physicians through clinical journals, educational webinars, conferences, tradeshows and e-mail marketing campaigns. While we do not sell directly to patients other than for our Evercord offering, we do engage in brand awareness campaigns directed at patients to highlight our products. Our marketing and medical science liaison team works extensively with key opinion leaders in the prenatal genetic testing field. We also dedicate resources to assist our laboratory partner network in marketing Panorama and our other products by conducting joint events, joint advertising and developing joint tools with our partner network. 
 We generate the highest gross margins on royalty revenue collected from laboratories that run tests in their own facilities and have the sequencing data analyzed by our Constellation software under our cloud-based distribution model. As of March 1, 2018, 12 signed licensees are commercializing products using our Constellation platform. We have 

 
  18

 
licensing contracts with other laboratory licensees, both in the United States and internationally, to develop their own NIPT LDTs and access our algorithm through our Constellation platform. 

Our partners' capabilities augment our direct sales capabilities, and where we have identified laboratory or distribution partners who share our focus on premium quality and service, we also contract with them to distribute our tests. We have partnered with leading academic and commercial laboratories and hospital systems in the United States to capitalize on their relationships with MFMs and OB/GYNs, large distribution capabilities, and commercial infrastructure. These distribution partners also frequently have in-network contracts with key third party payers. As of December 31, 2017, we had in-network contracts with insurance providers that accounted for approximately 200 million, out of a total of approximately 208 million, covered lives in the United States. We continue our efforts to increase the number of our in-network contracts with payers. Our target market for NIPT is a much smaller subset of these covered lives, because it excludes men, children and post-menopausal women who would not be users of the majority of our products. Outside of the United States, where our products are sold in over 80 countries, we currently sell predominantly through partner laboratories. 
 Enhanced User Experience 
 Natera Digital Services
 We have created an integrated platform encompassing various digital services designed to enhance the patient and provider experience. 
 Our patient portal is a one-stop resource for patients to access information and services throughout their experience with our products, from pre-test to post-test. After logging on to the patient portal, patients are able to easily access information about our tests and services, order tests, track their status and access results, and pay their bill. We have recently implemented a price transparency tool whereby patients can receive an estimate of their test cost and out of pocket responsibility, and have initially launched on a pilot basis a pre-test cost estimator whereby patients can receive a personalized cost estimate prior to a blood draw. We believe that these cost estimation features provide peace of mind to patients and providers and helps to mitigate cost concerns as a barrier to NIPT adoption.
 Natera Connect is our physician portal, which enables physicians to easily complete various tasks online including ordering tests, tracking the status of a patient's test, reviewing patient results online, sharing results with patients, connecting with genetic counselors, ordering supplies and educational materials, and offering live chat support. We also provide a service to integrate with our customers' Electronic Medical Records, or EMR, systems to provide physicians a seamless experience of ordering tests and reviewing patient test results directly through their EMR systems.
 Access to Genetic Counselors 
 After receiving a report with results from any of our products, doctors have access by phone to our team of genetic counselors should they have any questions or require any guidance in interpreting the results. Patients themselves may contact our genetic counselors for information by phone either before or after taking one of our tests, with direct access provided to all patients who are tested with Spectrum or Anora and patients who have a high risk result for a genetic disease based on the Horizon screening or for a microdeletion syndrome based on the Panorama screening.  Phlebotomy Services
 We have engaged over 2,000 phlebotomy centers in the United States. We also offer mobile phlebotomy services whereby a patient can request and schedule a phlebotomist visit at the patient’s home or office.

 Other Future Applications of our Technology
 We intend to refine and expand our offering in prenatal diagnostics by leveraging our core technology and the data we gather as our sample volumes grow. For example, the microdeletion samples that we gather through Panorama NIPT or through Anora POC testing help us to refine the algorithms that detect these anomalies, determine the exact genetic regions where these anomalies are sought, and increase the accuracy with which they are reported. We have substantial intellectual property covering the analysis of single cells, an approach we use to analyze embryos with our Spectrum products to improve the success of IVF. We believe that our technology may allow us to capitalize on future advances in isolating fetal cells from a mother's blood, which could allow us to measure more of the fetal genome non-invasively and with even higher accuracy, and potentially enable us to replace invasive confirmatory procedures, such as amniocentesis, over time. Importantly, we believe that we have a distinct advantage in our opportunity in single-cell isolation because our technology can not only analyze very small samples, but can also confirm that the cells are fetal as opposed to maternal.
 We believe that, in the future, our informatics technology may have the ability to generate a nearly full genome of an individual, roughly nine weeks after the individual is conceived. Publications in Genome Medicine, Science and PLoS Genetics highlight the ability of our informatics technology to determine which chromosome segments from the parent contributed to the DNA of the fetus and hence to substantially reconstruct the genome of the fetus using only a tiny amount of fetal DNA. This enhanced view of the full genome early in life, combined with knowledge of the parent DNA, has the potential to substantially impact the management of many aspects of an individual's health, from birth through adulthood. Future applications of such an offering may include prediction of disease susceptibilities and appropriate interventions, selection of drugs and drug dosages, nutrition guidance and many other emerging applications. 
 We believe that our ability to design custom panels and targeted assays can be utilized in various research applications such as variant discovery and mechanism of action studies, among others, and clinical applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. Some areas that we believe other researchers and laboratories may be interested in applying this technology are: forensic identity analysis in mixtures for law enforcement, organ transplant rejection monitoring, agricultural sample screening for patented lines, prenatal relationship testing for veterinary breeding and cell line purity testing for cell repositories. We are also investigating the potential application of our technology to other specimen types beyond blood, such as urine or sputum, which may have applications in the oncology diagnostics field.
 Key Relationships 
 Illumina
 We are party to a supply agreement with Illumina, Inc., or Illumina, for the supply of Illumina genetic sequencing instruments and reagents for NIPT, oncology and transplant diagnostic testing. For oncology, we also received rights to develop and sell in vitro diagnostic kits and services worldwide, in exchange for which we agreed to make certain milestone and royalty payments to Illumina. During the term of the supply agreement, which expires in June 2026, Illumina has agreed to supply us with sequencers, reagents and other consumables for use with the Illumina sequencers, and we must provide a forecast, on a monthly basis, detailing our needs for certain of the Illumina products. The first four calendar months of each forecast are binding and the fourth month can vary by only up to 25% more or less than what was forecasted for that month in the prior month's forecast. In addition, during each calendar quarter, we must spend a minimum amount on reagents under this agreement. We and Illumina have agreed on prices for the sequencers and reagents, for which we are entitled to certain discounts based on total spend and other factors. Illumina has the right to adjust these prices under certain conditions. In addition, we must pay a fee to Illumina for each clinical NIPT test that we perform using Illumina reagents. Illumina is currently the sole supplier of our sequencers and related reagents for Panorama, along with certain hardware and software; we are not bound to use exclusively Illumina's sequencing instruments and reagents for conducting our sequencing, but if we use other sequencing instruments and reagents for NIPT clinical use, we may no longer be entitled to discounts from Illumina. 
 Illumina may terminate the agreement: if we materially breach the agreement and fail to cure such breach within 30 days after receiving written notice of such breach, and only after complying with additional notice provisions; if we 

 
  20

 
become the subject of certain bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or in connection with certain changes of control of Natera. Illumina also has the right to terminate: (a) certain rights under the agreement upon two years’ prior notice, but no earlier than June 8, 2021; and (b) our rights with respect to IVDs if we have not obtained a premarket approval for at least one IVD from the United States Food and Drug Administration by June 8, 2021, unless we are diligently pursuing approval of an active PMA application at such time. We may terminate the agreement: if Illumina materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days after receiving written notice of such breach, and only after complying with additional notice provisions; if Illumina becomes the subject of certain bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; in connection with certain supply failures by Illumina or for convenience with four months written notice. The agreement also contains use limitations, representations and warranties, indemnification, limitations of liability and other provisions. 
 Qiagen
 We are party to a license, distribution and development agreement with QIAGEN LLC (the “Agreement”) for the development and distribution of NGS-based genetic tests on our proprietary technology for use on QIAGEN's proprietary GeneReader® NGS sequencing platform in certain countries globally. Under the Agreement, which has a ten (10) year term, we will receive an upfront license fee and prepaid royalties totaling $40 million. QIAGEN will owe us tiered royalties on a percentage basis based on net sales of its sequencers and reagent kits that are distributed by QIAGEN, as enabled by our technology. The tiers increase after the first and second years after commercial launch of such products. These royalties will initially be credited against the prepaid royalties and then paid quarterly to us once the prepaid royalties have been fully credited. QIAGEN has also committed to a minimum net sales requirement. We are also entitled to milestone payments from QIAGEN totaling $10 million upon the achievement of certain volume, regulatory, and commercial milestones.  
     For a certain period, QIAGEN is restricted from developing assays in prenatal screening competitive to the ones being developed based on our technology under this Agreement, and we are restricted from developing and selling certain in vitro diagnostic kits in prenatal screening independent of QIAGEN, unless such kits have been approved by regulatory authorities separately from a sequencing platform. These restrictions could be removed if QIAGEN fails to satisfy certain requirements related to the development and performance of its sequencing platform and to sales of the assays that are subject to the Agreement. In addition, if, in the future, QIAGEN satisfies certain requirements related to the development and performance of its sequencing platform for use with our prenatal screening assays, additional provisions related to an extended cooperation between both parties will apply.
     The Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants, termination provisions, and indemnification provisions that are generally customary for a transaction of this type. 
 We must return up to $15 million of the prepaid royalties if the Agreement expires, or under termination of the Agreement in most circumstances, without such prepaid royalties having been earned. The remainder of the prepaid royalties, to the extent not yet earned, and the technology access fee, are subject to return to QIAGEN by us only in the event of certain terminations of the Agreement.
     Competition 
 We compete with numerous companies that have developed and market NIPTs, including Sequenom, Inc., or Sequenom, which was acquired by Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, or LabCorp; Illumina, through its subsidiary Verinata;, Ariosa, Inc., a subsidiary of F. Hoffman La-Roche Ltd, or Roche; Counsyl, Inc.; Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, or Quest; Premaitha Health PLC; BGI; Berry Genomics Co., Ltd.; Progenity, Inc., or Progenity; LifeCodexx AG; Synlab International GmbH; Bio-Reference, a business unit of OPKO Health, Inc. and which was previously a laboratory distribution partner of ours; and Multiplicom N.V., which was acquired by Agilent Technologies Inc. We expect additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the prenatal testing market, including through business combinations, and new tests and technologies are introduced. These competitors could have greater technological, financial, reputational and market access resources than us. 

 
  21

 

 We also compete against companies providing carrier screening tests such as LabCorp; Counsyl, Inc.; Good Start Genetics, Inc., which has been acquired by Invitae Corp.; Progenity; Recombine Inc.; Quest; NxGen MDx LLC; Fulgent Genetics; and GenPath Diagnostics, a business unit of Bio-Reference. Each of these companies offers comprehensive CS panels.
 In cord blood and tissue banking, we compete with companies such as Cord Blood Registry, a subsidiary of AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; ViaCord, a division of PerkinElmer, Inc.; Cryo-Cell International, Inc.; CorCell Companies, Inc.; LifeBankUSA; AlphaCord LLC; StemCyte USA; and CariCord. We believe the principal competitive factors in this market include quality, measured by number and stature of accreditations; experience in transplants; stability and longevity; price, for example promotions, coupons and benefits such as referral programs; services offered, such as designated transplant programs and extra services such as access to genetic counselors; ease of customer experience, including process, communication, kit shipping and availability, and timely notifications. We believe that we compete favorably in this market based on all of these factors.
 In the field of cancer diagnostics, and liquid biopsy tests specifically, we will face competition from various companies that offer or seek to offer competing solutions, such as Roche Molecular Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Roche, Guardant Health, Inc., Personal Genome Diagnostics, Inc., Foundation Medicine, Inc., which is also a subsidiary of Roche, and Genomic Health Inc.
 We believe the principal competitive factors in the prenatal testing and cancer diagnostics markets include the following:

· | test performance, as demonstrated in clinical trials as well as in commercial experience;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | for prenatal testing, comprehensiveness of coverage of diseases and ability to conveniently test for multiple conditions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | for cancer diagnostics, comprehensiveness of coverage of cancer types and indications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | value of product offerings, including pricing and impact on other healthcare spending;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | scope of reimbursement and payer coverage;
--+-------------------------------------------


· | effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | breadth of distribution of products and partnership base;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | development and introduction of new, innovative products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | key opinion leader support;
--+----------------------------


· | brand awareness; and
--+---------------------


· | ease of integration for laboratories, including for cloud-based distribution models.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Specific market share data regarding our products is not publicly available, and consumers may choose to use competing products for a variety of reasons, including lower cost. We believe, however, that we compete favorably in the prenatal testing market on the basis of several factors, particularly test performance, comprehensiveness of coverage of diseases, ability to conveniently test for multiple conditions, value of product offerings and effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts.

 Research and Development
 We were founded on the belief that serious unmet needs in healthcare could be addressed by combining traditional molecular diagnostics with robust statistical techniques, and this belief is the basis of our research and development efforts. We focus our research and development efforts on conceiving and delivering disruptive technologies to genetic testing. We have invested, and continue to invest, significant time and resources toward improving and expanding our core technologies and tests. Our proprietary automated tool for assay design meaningfully streamlines our development process. Research and development expenses were $50.1 million, $41.9 million and $27.7 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Intellectual Property 
 Our success and ability to compete depend in part on securing and preserving enforceable patent, trade secret, trademark and other intellectual property rights; operating without having competitors infringe, misappropriate or otherwise circumvent these rights; operating without infringing the proprietary rights of others; and obtaining and maintaining licenses for technology development and/or product commercialization. As of December 31, 2017, we held 42 issued U.S. and foreign patents, which expire between November 2026 and November 2034, and nearly 100 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. Our patents and patent applications relate generally to molecular diagnostics, and more specifically to biochemical and analytical techniques for obtaining and analyzing genetic information to detect genetic abnormalities in relatively small complex samples, such as cell free fetal DNA or circulating tumor DNA. We intend to seek patent protection as we develop new technologies and products in this area.
 In the past, parties have filed, and in the future parties may file, claims asserting that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property. For example, we have in the past been involved in patent infringement litigation with Sequenom. We cannot predict whether other parties will assert such claims against us, or whether those claims will harm our business. The fields of non-invasive prenatal genetic testing and cancer diagnostics is complex and rapidly evolving, and we expect that we and others in our industry will continue to be subject to third-party infringement claims.
 Reimbursement 
 We receive reimbursement from commercial third-party payers and from government health benefits programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. We receive reimbursement for our Panorama, Horizon, Vistara, Anora and Spectrum tests. 
 Laboratory tests, as with most other healthcare services, are classified for reimbursement purposes under a coding system known as Current Procedure Terminology, or CPT, which we and our customers must use to bill and receive reimbursement for our diagnostic tests. These CPT codes are associated with the particular test that we have provided to the patient. Once the American Medical Association establishes a CPT code, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, establishes payment levels and coverage rules under Medicare while private payers establish rates and coverage rules independently. For most of the tests performed for Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries, laboratories are required to bill Medicare or Medicaid directly, and to accept Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement as payment in full. Prior to 2015, CMS had implemented a set of CPT codes without a fee schedule for most codes specific to NIPTs; however, a CPT code specific to NIPT for aneuploidies has been effective since January 2015, and a CPT code for microdeletions has been effective since January 2017. CMS has established a pricing benchmark of $802 for aneuploidy and microdeletions testing. In addition, the AMA has approved the use of a CPT code for expanded carrier screening tests, which will be published later this year. 
 We currently submit for reimbursement using CPT codes based on the guidance of outside legal and coding experts. There is a risk that these codes may be rejected or withdrawn or that payers will seek refunds of amounts that they claim were inappropriately billed to a specific CPT code. We do not currently have a specific CPT code assigned for all of our tests, and there is a risk that we may not be able to obtain specific codes for such tests, or if obtained, may not be able to negotiate favorable rates for one or more of these codes. In particular, while we have obtained a CPT code for microdeletions and CMS has set a price for microdeletions testing, we expect that our microdeletions reimbursement will 

 
  23

 
decline, at least in the near term, because third-party payers are declining to reimburse under the new code or reimbursing at a much lower rate than we had previously received.
 NIPT has received positive coverage determinations for high-risk pregnancies and are reimbursed by most private payers, including United Healthcare, AETNA, Anthem, Humana, CIGNA and others. Reimbursement policies for the use of NIPT for average-risk pregnancies have not been widely established, but recent publications have analyzed the use of NIPT in the average-risk population and certain medical societies have supported such use. In particular, ACMG has issued guidelines recommending that pregnant women be informed that NIPT is the most sensitive screening option for Patau, Edwards and Down syndromes, as well as of the availability of the expanded use of NIPT to screen for clinically relevant CNVs in the context of counseling that includes the risks/benefits and limitations of screening for CNVs. ISPD has issued guidelines that are supportive of NIPT in average-risk pregnancies as well as high-risk pregnancies. However, ACOG and SMFM have each issued guidelines stating that while all pregnant women should be informed of the option to receive NIPT, conventional screening methods, rather than NIPT, remain the most appropriate choice for first-line screening for average-risk pregnancies. Private payers are moving towards reimbursing for average-risk NIPT. Fifty-two commercial payers in the United States, representing over half of all commercial covered lives in the United States, have a positive coverage determination for NIPT for average-risk pregnancies.
 Based on Health Leaders publication data, as of December 31, 2017 we and our laboratory partners had in-network contracts with insurance providers that accounted for over 203 million covered lives, out of a total of approximately 208 million covered lives, in the United States. Our target market for NIPT is a much smaller subset of these covered lives, because it excludes men, children and post-menopausal women who would not be users of our products.
 Government Regulations 
 Our business is subject to and impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (at both the federal and state levels) and internationally. These laws and regulations include regulations particular to our business and laws and regulations relating to conducting business generally (e.g., export controls laws, U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws of other jurisdictions). We also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies. Set forth below are highlights of the key regulatory schemes applicable to our business. Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation 
 As a clinical laboratory, we are required to hold certain federal and state licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. As to federal certifications, in 1988, Congress passed the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, establishing more rigorous quality standards for all laboratories that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease. CLIA requires such laboratories to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. CLIA certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal healthcare programs, as well as many commercial third-party payers, for laboratory testing services. Our laboratory located in San Carlos, California is CLIA certified. Our laboratory must comply with all applicable CLIA requirements. 
 CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own more stringent laboratory regulatory requirements. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality control procedures or facility requirements, or prescribe record maintenance requirements. We are required to meet certain laboratory licensing requirements for those states in which we sell products who have adopted regulations beyond CLIA. For more information on state licensing requirements, see "—California Laboratory Licensing" and "—New York Laboratory Licensing."
 Our laboratory has also been accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, which means that our laboratory has been certified as following CAP guidelines in operating the laboratory and in performing tests that ensure the quality of our results.

 FDA 
 In the United States, medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, medical device development, testing, labeling, storage, premarket clearance or approval, advertising and promotion and product sales and distribution. To be commercially distributed in the United States, medical devices must receive from the FDA prior to marketing, unless subject to an exemption, either clearance of a premarket notification, or 510(k), or premarket approval, or a PMA.
 IVDs are a type of medical device that can be used in the diagnosis or detection of diseases, conditions or infections, including, without limitation, the presence of certain chemicals, genetic information or other biomarkers. Predictive, prognostic and screening tests, such as carrier screening tests, can also be IVDs. A subset of IVDs are known as analyte specific reagents, or ASRs. ASRs consist of single reagents, and are intended for use in a diagnostic application for the identification and quantification of an individual chemical substance in biological specimens. ASRs are medical devices, but most are exempt from the 510(k) and PMA premarket review processes. As medical devices, ASRs have to comply with some quality system regulation, or QSR, provisions and other device requirements.
 The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the fewest regulatory controls. Many Class I devices are exempt from FDA premarket review requirements. Class II devices, including some software products to the extent that they qualify as a device, are deemed to be moderate risk, and generally require clearance through the premarket notification, or 510(k) clearance, process. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices and are subject to the highest level of regulatory control to provide reasonable assurance of the device's safety and effectiveness. Class III devices typically require a PMA by the FDA before they are marketed. A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. All clinical studies of investigational devices must be conducted in compliance with any applicable FDA and Institutional Review Board requirements. Devices that are exempt from FDA premarket review requirements must nonetheless comply with post-market general controls as described below, unless the FDA has chosen to exercise enforcement discretion and not regulate them.
 510(k) clearance pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating to the FDA's satisfaction that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k)-cleared device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of PMA applications. The previously cleared device is known as a predicate. The FDA's 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months, but it can take longer, particularly for a novel type of product. 
 PMA pathway. The PMA pathway requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA's satisfaction. The PMA pathway is costly, lengthy, and uncertain. A PMA application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data as well as information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. As part of its PMA review process, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer's facilities for compliance with QSR requirements, which impose elaborate testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures. The PMA review process typically takes one to three years but can take longer. 
 De novo pathway. If no predicate device can be identified, the product is automatically classified as Class III, requiring a PMA application. However, the FDA can reclassify, or use "de novo classification," for a device for which there was no predicate device if the device is low- or moderate-risk. The FDA will identify "special controls" that the manufacturer must implement, which often includes labeling and other restrictions. Subsequent applicants can rely upon the de novo product as a predicate for a 510(k) clearance. The de novo route is less burdensome than the PMA process. A device company can ask the FDA at the outset if the de novo route is available and submit the application as one requesting de novo classification. The de novo route has been used for many IVD products. The FDA has indicated to us that our software that enables our cloud-based distribution model may be appropriate for review under the de novo classification process. However, the FDA has not committed to this position and may take a different position in the future.

 Post-market general controls. After a device, including a device exempt from FDA premarket review, is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the QSR, labeling regulations, registration and listing, the Medical Device Reporting regulation (which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation (which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act). 
 The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from an untitled or public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMAs already granted; and criminal prosecution. For additional information, see "Risk Factors—Reimbursement and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business." 
 Research use only. Research use only, or RUO, products belong to a separate regulatory classification under a long-standing FDA regulation. RUO products are not regulated as medical devices and are therefore not subject to the regulatory requirements discussed above. The products must bear the statement: "For Research Use Only. Not for Use in Diagnostic Procedures." RUO products cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility, and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use. A product labeled RUO but intended to be used diagnostically may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDC Act and is subject to FDA enforcement activities, including requiring the supplier to seek clearance or approval for the products. Our LDT uses instruments and reagents labeled as RUO. 
 Laboratory-developed tests. LDTs have generally been considered to be tests that are designed, developed, validated and used within a single laboratory. The FDA takes the position that it has the authority to regulate such tests as medical devices under the FDC Act. The FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion and has not required clearance or approval of LDTs prior to marketing. 
 On October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents regarding oversight of LDTs. These draft guidance documents proposed more active review of LDTs. The draft guidances have been the subject of considerable controversy, and in November 2016, the FDA announced that it would not be finalizing the 2014 draft guidance documents. On January 13, 2017, the FDA issued a discussion paper which laid out elements of a possible revised future LDT regulatory framework, but did not establish any regulatory requirements. 
 The FDA’s efforts to regulate LDTs have prompted the drafting of legislation governing diagnostic products and services that sought to substantially revamp the regulation of both LDTs and IVDs. Congress may still act to provide further direction to the FDA on the regulation of LDTs. 
 We believe that other than Signatera (RUO), all of the tests we currently offer, including Panorama, meet the definition of LDTs, as they have been designed, developed, and validated for use in a single CLIA-certified laboratory. If our tests are LDTs, they are currently not subject to FDA regulation as medical devices.
 California Laboratory Licensing 
 In addition to federal certification requirements for laboratories under CLIA, we are required under California law to maintain a California state license for our San Carlos clinical laboratory. The California licensure law establishes standards for the day-to-day operation of a clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control 

 
  26

 

 If a clinical laboratory is found to be out of compliance with California standards, the California Department of Health Services, or DHS, may suspend, restrict or revoke its license to operate the clinical laboratory, assess substantial civil money penalties, or impose specific corrective action plans. 
 New York Laboratory Licensing 
 Because we receive specimens from New York State, our clinical laboratory is required to be licensed under New York laws and regulations, which establish standards for the day-to-day operation of a clinical laboratory, including training and skill levels required of laboratory personnel; physical requirements of a facility; equipment; validation; and quality control.
     If a laboratory is found to be out of compliance with New York statutory or regulatory standards, the New York State Department of Health, or DOH, may suspend, limit, revoke or annul the laboratory's New York license, censure the holder of the license or assess civil money penalties. Statutory or regulatory noncompliance may result in a laboratory's operator being found guilty of a misdemeanor under New York law. Our clinical laboratory is licensed in the State of New York.
     DOH also must approve each specific LDT before the test is offered in New York. We have received a permit from New York to offer our basic Panorama test to women with high-risk pregnancies and a conditional approval to offer both our basic Panorama and Panorama with the microdeletions panel to all pregnant women, regardless of risk. We also have a permit from New York to offer our Horizon, Spectrum, Anora and non-invasive prenatal paternity tests. 
 Other State Laboratory Licensing Laws 
 In addition to New York and California, other states, including Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, require licensing of out-of-state laboratories under certain circumstances. We have obtained licenses in these four additional states and believe we are in compliance with applicable state laboratory licensing laws. 
 Potential sanctions for violation of state statutes and regulations include significant fines, the rejection of license applications and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could harm our business. CLIA does not preempt state laws that have established laboratory quality standards that are at least as stringent as federal law. 
 State Genetic Testing Laws 
 Many states have implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and protecting test results. In some cases, we are prohibited from conducting certain tests without appropriate documentation of patient consent by the physician ordering the test. Requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely. 
 HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws 
 The privacy and security regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and require certain entities, called covered entities, to comply with standards that include the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI. HIPAA further requires business associates of covered entities – independent contractors or agents of covered entities that have access to protected health information in connection with providing a service to or on behalf of a covered entity – to enter into business associate agreements with the covered entity and to safeguard the covered entity's PHI against improper use and disclosure. In addition, certain of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards are directly applicable to business associates.

 
  27

 

 As a covered entity and as a business associate of other covered entities (with whom we have therefore entered into business associate agreements), we have certain obligations regarding the use and disclosure of any PHI that may be provided to us, and we could incur significant liability if we fail to meet such obligations. Among other things, HITECH imposes civil and criminal penalties against covered entities and business associates for noncompliance with privacy and security requirements and authorizes states’ attorneys general to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 As noted above, we are required to comply with HIPAA standards promulgated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. First, we must comply with HIPAA's standards for electronic transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures. We must also comply with the standards for the privacy of individually identifiable health information, which limit the use and disclosure of most paper and oral communications, as well as those in electronic form, regarding an individual's past, present or future physical or mental health or condition, or relating to the provision of healthcare to the individual or payment for that healthcare, if the individual can or may be identified by such information. Additionally, we must comply with HIPAA's security standards, which require us to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronic protected health information that we create, receive, maintain or transmit, to protect against reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security of such information, and to protect such information from unauthorized use or disclosure.
 Various states in the United States have implemented similar restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information that are not necessarily preempted by HIPAA, particularly if a state affords greater protection to individuals than HIPAA. For example, Massachusetts law requires that any company that obtains personal information of any resident of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts implement and maintain a security program that adequately protects such information from unauthorized use or disclosure. 
 There are also foreign privacy and security laws and regulations that impose restrictions on the access, use and disclosure of health information. In particular, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, will become effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies not only to organizations within the EU, but also applies to organizations outside of the EU, such as Natera, that offer goods or services to EU data subjects or that process or hold personal data of EU data subjects. The regulation specifies higher potential liabilities for certain data protection violations, and we anticipate that it will result in a greater compliance burden for us as we conduct our business, particularly through our Constellation cloud-based distribution model, in the European Union. Fines for non-compliance can range from the greater of 2% of annual global revenues or €10 million, up to the greater of 4% of annual global revenues or €20 million.
 As a business that operates both internationally and throughout the United States, any unauthorized use or disclosure of personally identifiable information, even if it does not constitute PHI, by us or our third-party contractors, including disclosure due to data theft or unauthorized access to our or our third-party contractors' computer networks, could subject us to costs, fines or penalties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations, including the cost of providing notice, credit monitoring and identity theft prevention services to affected consumers. 
 Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it a felony for a provider or supplier, including a laboratory, to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any federal healthcare program. A violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in imprisonment for up to five years and/or criminal fines of up to $25,000, civil assessments and fines up to $50,000, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Although the federal Anti-Kickback Statute applies only to federal healthcare programs, a number of states have passed statutes substantially similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute pursuant to which similar types of prohibitions are made applicable to all other health plans and third-party payers. Actions which violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or similar laws may also involve liability under the Federal False Claims Act, which prohibits knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. Government.

 
  28

 

 Federal and state law enforcement authorities scrutinize arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to induce patient care referrals and opportunities. Law enforcement authorities, courts and Congress have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and actual or potential referral sources. Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce future referrals. 
 The HHS Office of Inspector General, or OIG, has issued Special Fraud Alerts on arrangements for the provision of clinical laboratory services and relationships between laboratories and referring physicians. The Fraud Alerts set forth a number of practices allegedly engaged in by some clinical laboratories and healthcare providers that raise issues under the federal fraud and abuse laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The OIG emphasized in the Special Fraud Alerts that when one purpose of such arrangements is to induce referrals of government program-reimbursed laboratory testing, both the clinical laboratory and the healthcare provider (e.g., physician) may be liable under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and may be subject to criminal prosecution and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 Recognizing that the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, HHS has issued a series of regulatory "safe harbors" which provide confidence to healthcare providers and other parties that they may not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute if they can demonstrate compliance with each element of the safe harbor. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. 
 While we believe that we are in compliance with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or similar laws, there can be no assurance that our relationships with physicians, hospitals and other customers will not be subject to scrutiny or will survive regulatory challenge under such laws. If imposed for any reason, sanctions under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or any similar state statute could have a negative effect on our business. 
 Because our laboratory is located in California, California law is applicable to our business arrangements. Both California's fee-splitting statute, Business and Professions Code Section 650, and its Medi-Cal anti-kickback statute, Welfare and Institutions Code Section 14107.2, have been interpreted by the California Attorney General and California courts in substantially the same way as the federal government and the courts have interpreted the federal Anti-kickback Statute. A violation of Section 650 is punishable by imprisonment and fines of up to $50,000. A violation of Section 14107.2 is punishable by imprisonment and fines of up to $10,000. 
 In addition to the requirements that are discussed above, there are other healthcare fraud and abuse laws that could have an impact on our business. The federal False Claims Act prohibits a person from knowingly submitting or causing to be submitted false claims or making a false record or statement in order to secure payment by the federal government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud sometimes referred to as a “whistleblower”. Because the complaints are initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the private party plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government's involvement, then the private party plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. Violation of the federal False Claims Act may result in fines of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of up to approximately $22,000 for each separate false claim, imprisonment or both, and possible exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid. 
 We are also subject to a federal law directed at "self-referrals," commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits, with certain exceptions, payments made by a laboratory to a physician in exchange for the provision of clinical laboratory services, or presenting or causing to be presented claims to Medicare and Medicaid for laboratory tests referred by physicians who personally, or through a family member, have an investment interest in, or a compensation arrangement 

 
  29

 
with, the clinical laboratory performing the tests. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law's referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000 for each such arrangement or scheme. In addition, any person who presents or causes to be presented a claim to the Medicare or Medicaid programs in violation of the Stark Law is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per claim submission, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed, and possible exclusion from participation in federal governmental payer programs. Claims submitted in violation of the Stark Law may not be paid by Medicare or Medicaid, and any person collecting any amounts with respect to any such prohibited claim is obligated to refund such amounts. 
 Many states, including California, also have state anti-"self-referral" and other laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals, with which we must comply. We are subject to the California's Physician Ownership and Referral Act, or PORA. PORA generally prohibits us from billing a patient or any governmental or private payer for any diagnostic services when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician's immediate family, has an investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition. Further, a violation of PORA is a misdemeanor and could result in civil penalties and criminal fines. 
 Other states may have self-referral restrictions with which we have to comply that differ from those imposed by federal and California law. 
 We are also subject to applicable state client billing laws (also known as “pass through billing”), which specify whether a provider that did not perform the service is permitted to submit the claim for payment and if so, whether the non-performing provider is permitted to mark up the cost of the services in excess of the price the purchasing provider paid for such services. California has an anti-markup statute with which we must comply, which prohibits providers from charging for a laboratory test that it did not perform unless the provider (a) notifies the patient of the name, address, and charges of the laboratory performing the test, and (b) charges no more than what he or she was charged by the clinical laboratory which performed the test. A violation of this provision can lead to imprisonment and/or fines. Other states have similar anti-markup prohibitions with which we must comply. In addition, many states are so-called “direct-bill” states, which means that the services actually performed by an individual or entity must be billed by such individual or entity, thus preventing ordering physicians from purchasing services from a laboratory and billing for the services they order at a higher price.
 While we have attempted to comply with the federal fraud and abuse laws, California fraud and abuse laws and similar laws of other states, it is possible that some of our arrangements could be subject to regulatory scrutiny at some point in the future, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be found to be in compliance with these laws following any such regulatory review. 
 Further, in addition to the privacy and security regulations stated above, HIPAA created two federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. 
 Finally, federal law prohibits any entity from offering or transferring to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration that the entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary's selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof) and transfers of items or services for free or for other than fair market value. Entities found in violation may be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act. Although we believe that our sales and marketing practices are in material compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations, relevant regulatory authorities may disagree, and violation of these laws or our exclusion from such programs as Medicaid and other governmental programs as a result of a violation of such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

     Natera, Inc.
 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
     1.    Description of Business
     Natera, Inc. (the "Company") was formed in the state of California as Gene Security Network, LLC in November 2003 and incorporated in the state of Delaware in January 2007. The Company’s mission is to change the management of genetic disease worldwide. The Company operates a laboratory certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ("CLIA") providing a host of preconception and prenatal genetic testing services. The Company determines its operating segments based on the way it organizes its business to make operating decisions and assess performance. The Company has only one operating segment, which is the discovery, development and commercialization of genetic testing services and it has a subsidiary that operates in the state of Texas. 
     The Company's product offerings include its Panorama Non-Invasive Prenatal Test ("NIPT") that screens for chromosomal abnormalities of a fetus typically with a blood draw from the mother; Vistara (“Vistara”), a single-gene mutations screening test performed to identify single-gene disorders; Horizon Carrier Screening ("HCS") to determine carrier status for a large number of severe genetic diseases that could be passed on to the carrier’s children; Spectrum Pre-implantation Genetic Screening ("PGS") and Spectrum Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis ("PGD") to analyze chromosomal anomalies or inherited genetic conditions during an in vitro fertilization ("IVF") cycle to select embryos with the highest probability of becoming healthy children; Anora Products of Conception ("POC") test to rapidly and extensively analyze fetal chromosomes to understand the cause of miscarriage; Non-Invasive Paternity Testing ("PAT"), to determine paternity by analyzing the fragments of fetal deoxyribonucleic acid ("DNA") in a pregnant mother's blood and a blood sample from the alleged father(s), which is marketed and sold exclusively by a licensee from whom the Company receives a royalty. All testing is available principally in the United States, and the Company offers its Panorama test to customers outside of the United States. The Company also offers Constellation (“Constellation”), a cloud-based software product that allows laboratory customers to gain access through the cloud to the Company’s algorithms and bioinformatics in order to validate and launch tests based on the Company’s technology. The Company also offers Evercord, which is a cord blood and cord tissue processing and storage service; and SignateraTM, a circulating tumor DNA technology that analyzes and tracks mutations specific to an individual’s tumor, for research use only by oncology and biopharmaceutical companies. Further, the Company has expanded its Panorama test to now screen twin pregnancies for zygosity and chromosomal abnormalities.
     Initial Public Offering 
     In July 2015, the Company completed an initial public offering (“IPO”), and subsequently in August 2015, the Company completed the sale of additional shares upon exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. In connection with the IPO, including the over-allotment option, the Company sold 10,900,000 shares of common stock at $18.00 per share, which raised $178.5 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.             2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
     Basis of Presentation
     The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). 
     Liquidity Matters
     The Company has incurred net losses since its inception and anticipates net losses and negative operating cash flows for the near future. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had a net loss of $136.3 million, and as of December 31, 2017, it had an accumulated deficit of $482.2 million. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $12.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, $106.2 million in marketable securities, $50.1 million of outstanding balance of the Credit Line (as defined in Note 8) including accrued interest, and $73.1 million of net carrying amount of the 2017 Term 

 
  99

 
Loan (as defined in Note 8). While the Company has introduced multiple products that are generating revenues, these revenues have not been sufficient to fund all operations. Accordingly, the Company has funded the portion of operating costs that exceeds revenues through a combination of equity issuances, debt issuances, and other financings. 
     The Company continues to develop and commercialize future products and, consequently, it will need to generate additional revenues to achieve future profitability and may need to raise additional equity or debt financing. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, its stockholders would experience dilution. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting its operations or its ability to incur additional debt. Any additional debt financing or additional equity that the Company raises may contain terms that are not favorable to it or its stockholders and require significant debt service payments, which diverts resources from other activities. Additional financing may not be available at all, or in amounts or on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain additional financing, it may be required to delay the development, commercialization and marking of its products and significantly scale back its business and operations.  
     On March 10, 2018, the Company entered into a Distribution Agreement with Qiagen to develop, manufacture, distribute and commercialize NGS-based genetic testing assays for clinical use based on the Company’s proprietary Panorama NIPT technology. According to the agreement, the Company will receive a total of $40.0 million before March 31, 2018. Additionally, the Company is entitled to potential milestone payments totaling $10.0 million from Qiagen upon the achievement of certain volume, regulatory and commercial milestones. The Distribution Agreement has a term of 10 years and expires in March 2028.
     Based on the Company’s current business plan, the Company believes that its existing cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash requirements for at least 12 months after March 15, 2018.
     Principles of Consolidation
     The accompanying consolidated financial statements include all the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary. The Company established a subsidiary that operates in the state of Texas in December 2014 to support the Company’s laboratory and operational functions, which became active in the second quarter of 2015. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.     Use of Estimates
     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Significant items subject to such estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, software development costs to be capitalized, accrued liability for potential refund requests, stock-based compensation, fair value of common stock and warrants, as well as income tax uncertainties. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions using historical experience and other factors, including contractual terms and statutory limits; however, actual results could differ from these estimates and could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial statements.      Fair Value
     The Company discloses the fair value of financial instruments for financial assets and liabilities for which the value is practicable to estimate. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price) and the Company carries its warrants at fair value measurement guidance.     Cash and Cash Equivalents
     Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and money market deposits with financial institutions.
    
 
  100

 

 Restricted Cash
     The Company discloses both short-term and long-term restricted cash.  Short-term restricted cash consists of cash deposits held to secure commercial letters of credit issued by financial institutions, and the balance was insignificant as of December 31, 2017. Long-term restricted cash consists of $0.3 million deposit per credit card terms.       Investments
     Investments consist primarily of debt securities such as U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency and municipal bonds. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company generally classifies its entire investment portfolio as available-for-sale. The Company views its available-for-sale portfolio as available for use in current operations. Accordingly, the Company classifies all investments as short-term, even though the stated maturity may be more than one year from the current balance sheet date. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a separate component of stockholders’ equity.      Risk and Uncertainties
     The Company has various financial instruments that are potentially subjected to credit risk, and they consist of cash, accounts receivable and investments. The Company limits its exposure to credit loss by placing its cash in financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Company's cash may consist of deposits held with banks that may at times exceed federally insured limits. The Company performs evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. 
     The Company bills third-party payers for certain tests performed. The amount that is ultimately received from the payer for the Company’s claim and the timing of such payments are subject to the determination of the payer based on the nature of the test performed and their view of the Company’s business practices with respect to collections of plan deductibles and co-payments from patients and other activities. This determination can impact both the amount and timing of when the Company’s invoices are collected. Payers may also withhold payments and request refunds of prior payments if the payer asserts that the Company has not performed in accordance with the policies of these payers. 
     The Company performs evaluations of financial conditions for clinics and laboratory partners and generally does not require collateral to support credit sales. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, there were no customers exceeding 10% of total revenues on an individual basis. As of December 31, 2017, there were no customers with an outstanding balance exceeding 10% of net accounts receivable, and as of December 31, 2016, one customer, Bio-Reference, had an outstanding balance of approximately 52% of net accounts receivable, which was collected in full by the Company in February 2017. 
     Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
     Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the amount billed to the laboratory partners and clinics. Reducing this amount is an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make the contracted payments. Management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and changes in customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable are written off against the allowance when there is substantive evidence that the account will not be paid.     Revenue Recognition
     The Company generally bills an insurance carrier, a clinic or a patient for tests it sells upon delivery of the test results. The Company also bills patients directly for out-of-pocket costs not covered by their insurance carriers representing co-pays and deductibles in accordance with their insurance carrier and health plans. For tests performed, where an agreed upon reimbursement rate or fixed fee and a predictable history or likelihood of collections exists, the Company recognizes revenues upon delivery of the test report to the prescribing physician based on the established billing rate less other adjustments such as reserves for retractions and refunds to arrive at the amount that the Company expects to collect. In all 

 
  101

 
other situations, as the Company does not have sufficient history of collection and is not able to determine collectability, the Company recognizes revenues when cash is received. The Company may not get reimbursed for tests completed if the tests are not covered under the insurance carrier’s reimbursement policies or the Company is not a qualified provider to the insurance carrier, or if the tests were not previously authorized. From time to time, the Company receives requests for refunds of payments previously made by insurance carriers. The Company has established an accrued liability for potential refund requests based on its experience, which is accounted for as reductions in revenues in the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. For the year ended December 31, 2017, $4.9 million was reversed from this accrued liability and recognized as revenue.
     In cases where the Company sells its tests through its laboratory partners, the majority of the laboratory partners bill the patient, clinic, or insurance carrier for the performance of the Company's tests. 
     For tests sold through a limited number of its laboratory partners, the Company bills directly to a patient, clinic or insurance carrier, or a combination of the insurance carrier and patient for the fees. The Company considers its services rendered when it delivers reports of its test results to the laboratory partner, clinic or patient. When the Company has contracted fixed rates for its services and collectability of its revenues is reasonably assured, it recognizes revenues upon delivery of test reports. The fixed fees identified in contracts with laboratory partners change only if a pricing amendment is agreed upon between both parties. For cases in which there is no fixed price established with a laboratory partner, the Company then recognizes revenues from partner distributed tests on a cash basis. 
     Certain of the Company's arrangements include multiple deliverables. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, the Company evaluates each deliverable to determine whether it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting. This determination is based on whether the deliverable has "stand-alone value" to the customer and whether a general right of return exists. The consideration that is fixed or determinable is then allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable. The consideration allocated to each unit of accounting is recognized as the related goods or services are delivered, limited to the consideration that is not contingent upon future deliverables. The Company uses judgment in identifying the deliverables in its arrangements, assessing whether each deliverable is a separate unit of accounting, and in determining the best estimate of selling price for certain deliverables. The Company also uses judgment in determining the period over which the deliverables are recognized in certain of its arrangements. Any amounts received that do not meet the criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue until such criteria are met. 
     The Company recognizes revenue from its cloud-based distribution service offering, Constellation. The Company grants its licensees licenses to use certain of the Company’s proprietary intellectual properties and the Company’s cloud-based software and provides other services to support the use of the Company's proprietary technology by its licensees. The Company’s proprietary software is used in connection with the analysis of DNA sequence data in a manner yielding a result indicating the likely presence or absence of full or partial chromosomal abnormalities. The licensees do not have the right to possess the Company’s software, but rather receive the software as a service. The revenues are recognized on an accrual basis (assuming all revenue recognition criteria are met) under the terms of the related agreements and are included in licensing and other revenues in the statements of operation and comprehensive loss.
     The Company recognizes revenues from Evercord for the collection and storage of newborn cord blood and cord tissue units. Deliverables consist of: (i) the provision of a collection kit and the processing of newborn cord blood and cord tissue units, which are considered delivered at the beginning of the process (the “processing services”), with revenue for this deliverable recognized after the collection and successful processing of the cord blood and cord tissue units, and (ii) the storage of the cord blood and cord tissue units (the “storage services”), for either an annual fee or a prepayment covering an extended period or the lifetime of the newborn donor, with revenue for this deliverable recognized ratably over the applicable storage period. The Company bundles its processing services together with the first year of storage, and each of them has its own standalone value to customers, and therefore, represents a separate deliverable. The selling price for the processing services and the storage services are estimated based on the best estimate of selling price because the Company does not have vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of selling price for these elements. Evercord revenues are reported in licensing and other revenues in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

 Cost of Product Revenues
     The components of cost of product revenues are material and service costs, impairment charges associated with testing equipment, personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with testing samples, electronic medical record, order and delivery systems, shipping charges to transport samples, third-party test processing fees and allocated overhead including rent, information technology costs, equipment depreciation and utilities. Costs associated with the performance of diagnostic services are recorded as tests are accessioned.     Cost of Licensing and Other Revenues 
     The components of cost of licensing and other revenues are material costs associated with test kits, engineering costs incurred by the research and development team to improve and maintain the Constellation software platform, and amortization of Constellation software development costs. Costs also include collection kits consumed during the processing of cord blood samples, processing service and storage of the cord blood samples, and freight charged to transport the samples to the storage facility.      Research and Development 
     The Company records research and development costs in the period incurred. Research and development costs consist of personnel costs, contract services, cost of materials utilized in performing tests, costs of clinical trials and allocated facilities and related overhead expenses.      Advertising Costs 
     The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. The Company incurred advertising costs of $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
     Product Shipment Costs 
     The Company expenses product shipment costs in cost of product revenues in the accompanying statements of operations. Shipping and handling costs for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $9.5 million, $8.2 million and $7.0 million, respectively.       Income Taxes 
     Income taxes are recorded in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ("ASC 740"), which provides for deferred taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Tax benefits are recognized when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained during an audit. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if current evidence indicates that it is considered more likely than not that these benefits will not be realized.
     Stock‑Based Compensation
     Stock‑based compensation related to stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to the Company’s employees is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The fair value is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. No compensation cost is recognized when the requisite service has not been met and the awards are therefore forfeited. 
     The Company uses the Black‑Scholes option‑pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options issued to employees and non-employees. The measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustments as the underlying equity instruments vest, and the resulting change in value, if any, is recognized in the Company's statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the period that the related services are rendered.

 
  103

 

     The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of the Company's expected stock price volatility, the expected term of the awards, and a risk-free interest rate. Determining these assumptions requires significant judgment. The expected term was based on the simplified method and the volatility rate was based on that of publicly traded companies in the DNA sequencing, diagnostics, or personalized medicine industries. When selecting the public companies in these industries to be used in the volatility calculation, companies were selected with comparable characteristics to the Company, including enterprise value and financial leverage. Companies were also selected with historical share price volatility sufficient to meet the expected term of the Company's stock options. The historical volatility data was computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies' shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of the Company's stock options. The expected term of the non-employee option grants was based on their remaining contractual life at the measurement date. The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on U.S. Treasury instruments with maturities that were consistent with the option's expected term. 
     Starting January 1, 2016, the Company began using a different approach to estimate the expected term of its stock option awards, which involves calculating the average of—(1) its employees’ historical stock option exercise behavior, and (2) the weighted-average of the time-to-vesting and the total contractual life of the options. The Company applied this change in methodology prospectively and accounted for it as a change in accounting estimate.
     Warrants
     The Company accounts for warrants to purchase shares of its common stock as a liability at fair value on the balance sheet date because the Company may be obligated to redeem these warrants at some point in the future. The warrants are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date, with changes in fair value recognized as a gain or loss from the changes in fair value of the warrants in the statements of operations. The Company will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value until such time that the warrants are converted or expire.     Capitalized Software Held for Internal Use 
     The Company capitalizes salaries and related costs of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal-use software development projects. Capitalization begins during the application development stage, once the preliminary project stage has been completed. If a project constitutes an enhancement to previously developed software, the Company assesses whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software, thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization. Once the project is available for general release, capitalization ceases and the Company estimates the useful life of the asset and begin amortization. The Company periodically assesses whether triggering events are present to review internal-use software for impairment. Changes in estimates related to internal-use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the reporting period. 
     The Company amortizes its internal-use software over the estimated useful lives of three years. The net book value of capitalized software held for internal use was $2.6 million and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amortized expense for amounts previously capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $1.0 million, $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively. 
     Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss        Comprehensive loss and its components encompass all changes in equity other than those with stockholders, and include net loss, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. As of December 31, 2017, and 2016, accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of $0.8 million and $0.7 million of unrealized losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. See Note 4 for additional disclosures related to change in net unrealized losses and reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive loss upon the sale of available-for-sale marketable securities.  
    
 
  104

 

 Property and Equipment
     Property and equipment, including purchased and internally developed software, are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease, whichever is shorter. The Company periodically reviews the depreciable lives assigned to property and equipment placed in service and change the estimates of useful lives to reflect the results of such reviews.       Impairment of Long-lived Assets
     The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company then compares the carrying amounts of the assets with the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the asset’s fair value determined using discounted estimates of future cash flows. See Note 5 for more detail about the asset impairment.       Inventory 
     Inventory is valued at the lower of the standard cost, which approximates actual cost, or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. Inventory consists entirely of supplies, which are consumed when providing its test reports, and therefore does not maintain any finished goods inventory. The Company enters into inventory purchases and commitments so that it can meet future delivery schedules based on forecasted demand for its tests.
     The Company recorded inventory obsolescence charges totaling $0.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company determined $2.1 million of inventory as obsolete in connection with its impairment analysis of the associated automation and sequencing equipment described in Note 5, and recorded an associated charge for these materials. 
     Recent Accounting Pronouncements
     From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) under its accounting standard codifications (“ASC”) or other standard setting bodies and adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed below, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption.     Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
     In July 2015, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (“ASU 2015-11”). ASU 2015-11 simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by replacing today’s lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. The guidance applies only to inventories for which cost is determined by methods other than last-in first-out (“LIFO”) and the retail inventory method (“RIM”). Entities that use LIFO and RIM will continue to use existing impairment models (i.e. entities using LIFO would apply the lower of cost or market test). From an operating perspective, the Company does not manufacture products for sale as it is a provider of genetic tests. The Company keeps inventory consisting mainly of laboratory materials and supplies that are consumed during the testing process. Under the existing guidance, the Company measured its inventory at the lower of standard cost or its net realizable value, which was considered as market. This process remains unchanged under the new guidance, and upon adopting ASU 2015-11 in the first quarter of 2017, it did not result in a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures.
     In November 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be presented as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The Company adopted ASU 2015-17 prospectively in the first quarter of 2017, which did not result 

 
  105

 
in a material impact on its financial statements and related disclosures as a full valuation allowance has been reserved against the deferred tax assets and liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. No retrospective adjustments were made to the prior periods’ financial statements and related disclosures.
     In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The new guidance requires any excess tax benefits (“windfalls”) and tax deficiencies (“shortfalls”) associated with vested or settled share-based awards to be recognized in the income statement rather than additional paid-in capital, which is to be applied prospectively. Further, windfalls are required to be presented as an operating activity rather than as an outflow from operating activity and an inflow to financing activity, as required by the existing guidance. The Company adopted this new presentation guidance prospectively in the first quarter of 2017, which did not result in a material impact to its financial statements and related disclosures as a full valuation allowance has been reserved against the deferred tax assets and liabilities due to significant losses incurred since the Company’s inception. Therefore, there was no cumulative-effect adjustment required upon adoption. In addition, ASU 2016-09 allows entities to withhold an amount up to the employees’ maximum individual tax rate in the relevant jurisdiction without having to account for the award as a liability-based award with a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings on the modified retrospective approach. This new guidance is not applicable to the Company as it does not have a practice of withholding shares nor offsetting net-share settlement, and the Company does not withhold taxes exceeding its minimum statutory tax rate. ASU 2016-09 also permits forfeitures to be either estimated, as required by the existing guidance, or recognized when they occur. The change in the accounting for forfeitures is required to be applied using a modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings. Upon adoption of this new guidance in the first quarter of 2017, the Company made an accounting policy election to continue estimating forfeitures as required by the existing guidance, which did not result in a cumulative-effect adjustment.
     New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
     In May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09, which defines the core principles of ASC 606, establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance mandates a five-step process, which requires entities to exercise significant judgment and involves estimates to be made on the transaction price and the timing over which revenue will be recognized. Entities have a choice of adopting the new guidance using either the full retrospective approach, which requires restatement of financial statements in each prior reporting period presented, or the modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative-effect adjustment made to the opening retained earnings at the initial date of adoption. The new guidance will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018. 
     The Company has elected to adopt this new standard effective January 1, 2018, using the full retrospective approach.  Under this approach, the Company will restate its results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, including retained earnings, and applicable interim periods within those years, as if ASC 606 had been effective for those periods.
     Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue recognition for arrangements that fall within the scope of ASC 606 is evaluated under its prescribed five-step approach. ASC 606 also impacts certain other areas, such as the accounting for costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.  The new standard also requires disclosures of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.
     In 2017, the company established an implementation team and engaged external advisers to develop a multi-phase plan to assess the company’s business and contracts, as well as any changes to processes or systems to adopt the requirements of the new standard. To date, the Company’s revenues have been derived primarily from contracts with insurance carriers, patients, laboratory partners and licensing arrangements. Due to the constraints on establishing fixed pricing and collectability, a significant portion of the Company’s revenues from insurance carriers is recognized on cash basis under the existing guidance. However, ASC 606 eliminates such constraints and requires estimates to be made on variable consideration at the inception of an arrangement, thus cash basis of accounting is no longer applied. Under ASC 

 
  106

 
606, some of these insurance carriers arrangements have similar characteristics and are being evaluated collectively as a portfolio to reflect consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for goods and services.  The Company determines its expected consideration based on the combined effect of historical and most current collections pattern. Due to the fact that several of the insurance carriers that contribute a material portion of the Company’s revenues have recently adopted new reimbursement standards, which require prior authorization from them at or soon after the date of service and the time claims are submitted for reimbursements, there is always a time lag between the period in which services are provided and when payments are actually received. Given the time needed to gather the most recent collection data before the arrangement consideration can be derived, the Company is currently still in the process of finalizing its analysis for the implementation of ASC 606 as of January 1, 2018. The analysis primarily relates to the estimation of variable consideration as of the date of transition, which requires the knowledge of collections made from prior test deliveries before the end of the first quarter of 2018. 
     In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. ASU 2016-02 is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and requires substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted. The Company plans to adopt this new guidance prospectively in the first quarter of 2019. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its financial statements, and expects that it will increase its lease assets and correspondingly increase its lease liabilities.
     In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (A Consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). The purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to limit diversity in the classification of certain transactions in the statement of cash flows. Such transactions include (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (2) settlement of zero-coupon bonds, (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (4) proceeds from insurance claims settlement, (5) proceeds from settlement of life insurance policies, and (6) distributions of equity method investments. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to result in a material impact to its financial statements and related disclosures.
     In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. The purpose of ASU 2016-18 is to eliminate the diversity in classifying and presenting changes in restricted cash in the statements of cash flows. The new guidance requires restricted cash to be combined with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and ending balances of cash on the statement of cash flows, thereby no longer requiring transactions such as transfers between restricted and unrestricted cash to be treated as a cash flow activity. Further, the new guidance requires the nature of the restrictions to be disclosed, as well as a reconciliation between the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows on how restricted and unrestricted cash are segregated. The new guidance will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018, and it must be adopted retrospectively. Upon adoption, the Company will eliminate restricted cash as a separate line item in the statements of cash flows in all periods presented, and a reconciliation between restricted cash and cash and cash equivalents will be shown either on the face of the associated financial statement or in a disclosure. 
     In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting. The purpose of this new guidance is to clarify when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. Under the new guidance, modification accounting is required only if the fair value, the vesting conditions, or the classification of the award (as equity or liability) changes as a result of the change in terms or conditions. The new guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2018, and the Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to result in a material impact to its financial statements and related disclosures.
     In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This new guidance was established as a result of the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which provides an opportunity for entities to reclassify residual income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings due to the reduction of corporate income tax rate. The new guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019, and interim periods within that year, with early adoption permitted.

     3.    Fair Value Measurements
     The Company's financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are comprised of investment assets that include money market and investments, a liability for convertible preferred stock warrants and a liability for common stock warrants.  
     The fair value accounting guidance requires that assets and liabilities be carried at fair value and classified in one of the following three categories:
     Level I: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the Company has the ability to access
     Level II: Observable market‑based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data, such as quoted prices, interest rates, and yield curves
     Level III: Inputs that are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data.
     This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. There were no transfers between Level I, Level II and Level III during the periods presented.
     Assets and Liabilities That Are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
     The following table represents the fair value hierarchy for the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
    
 | December 31, 2017 | | December 31, 2016 |

Total financial liabilities | $ | — | | $ | — | $ | 2,644 | | $ | 2,644 | $ | — | | $ | — | $ | 3,792 | $ | 3,792 

      The Company's warrants to purchase common stock are valued using Level III inputs; the Company used inputs from a Black-Scholes model with market volatility that is determined for comparable companies in the same business sector. The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate their fair value and are excluded from the table above. 
     In April 2013, the Company entered into a senior secured term loan with a third-party lender, which consisted of a credit agreement, royalty agreement, warrants and loan commitment. Based upon the Company’s evaluation, the senior secured term loan constituted a liability with embedded derivative features that was accounted for separately as mark-to-market instruments. In addition, adjustments to the embedded royalty feature were recorded as interest expense as they occurred, offset to the carrying amount of the debt (with the eventually cash outlay to settle such amounts recorded against the carrying amount of the debt). Based on the Company’s evaluation, it was determined that the warrants granted are detachable and therefore are a stand-alone component of the senior secured term loan to be fair valued using Level III inputs as a separate derivative. In October 2015, the Company repaid the entire borrowings under the senior secured term loan.

 
  108

 

     The fair value of both the senior secured term loan and warrants was remeasured at the end of each reporting period, with the change in fair value for the term loan recorded as interest benefit from changes in the fair value of long-term debt and the remeasurement gain or loss on the warrants recorded within interest and other income (expense), net in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
     The following table provides a roll forward of the fair value, as determined by Level III inputs, of the warrants for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:
    
 | Warrants | 
 | 2017 | | 2016 | 
 | (in thousands) | 
Beginning balance | $ | 3,792 | | $ | 3,649
Change in fair value | | (1,148) | | | 143 
Ending balance | $ | 2,644 | | $ | 3,792

          The following table presents quantitative information about the inputs and valuation methodologies used for the Company’s fair value measurement classified in Level III of the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2017.
    
 | | | | | | | | Weighted Average

 | (in thousands) | | | | | | (in thousands) | 
Warrants | $ | 2,644 | | Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model | | Volatility | | | 40.93 | %

      Warrants
     The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value of warrants are derived from the Company's common stock valuation that is based upon a model with inputs from a Black-Scholes model and market volatility that is determined for comparable companies in the same business sector. The inherent risk in the market volatility is the selection of companies with similar business attributes to the Company.

 4. Financial Instruments
     The Company elected to invest a portion of its cash assets in conservative, income earning, liquid investments effective September 2015. Cash equivalents and investments, all of which are classified as available-for-sale securities, consisted of the following:
 | December 31, 2017 | | December 31, 2016 |

Total | | | | | | | | | $ | 109,724 | | | | | | | | $ | 141,637

      The Company invests in U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency and high quality municipal bonds which mature at par and are all paying their coupons on schedule. Thus, the Company has determined there is currently no other than temporary impairment of its investments, and will continue to recognize unrealized losses in other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has 19 investments in an unrealized loss position in its portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the amount of gross realized gains and realized losses upon sales of investments were insignificant, and during the year ended December 31, 2016, sales of investments resulted in gross realized gains of $0.2 million and insignificant gross realized losses. Realized gains and losses are reported in interest and other income (expense), net in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The following table shows the change in the net unrealized positions of the available-for-sale securities and reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss upon the sale of those securities:
    
 | December 31, 
 | 2017 | | 2016

(Decrease) increase in other comprehensive loss | | (41) | | | 691 
Balance at end of year | $ | (766) | | $ | (725) 

      During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company earned interest income of $1.2 million, $1.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, from its investment portfolio.

      All of the Company’s long-lived assets are located in the United States.
     During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded asset impairment charges totaling $0.6 million in cost of product revenues in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss. This charge was recorded after certain sequencing and automation equipment were fully decommissioned in January 2017.
     During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded asset impairment charges totaling $2.1 million in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss, of which $1.9 million was recorded in cost of product revenues and $0.2 million was included in general and administrative expenses, following its impairment analysis on certain sequencing and automation equipment whose service lives were determined to be significantly shorter than initially expected. These charges also included the write-off of $0.3 million unamortized maintenance service contract prepayments

related to the impaired equipment described above. The Company expected to phase out the equipment in the first quarter of 2017 as the Company began its transition to the next generation of sequencing and automation equipment to help streamline its production workflows. 
     The Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $1.0 million against a specific group of machinery and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company no longer uses this specific group of machinery and equipment because of outsourcing to its partners. The impairment charge was recorded to reflect reductions in the estimated realizable value of the machinery and equipment as a result of planning for its sale in the secondary market. The Company recorded the total impairment charge of $1.0 million in cost of product revenues. The Company sold some of the impaired machinery and equipment during the fourth quarter of 2015 for $0.5 million and classified the remaining impaired machinery and equipment as held for sale at the estimated realizable value of $0.2 million. The remaining impaired machinery was sold in January 2016 for $0.2 million. 
     Other Assets
     In April 2016, the Company entered into a four-year agreement with an insurance carrier whereby in return for partial exclusivity and the right to pricing benefits the Company paid total consideration of $3.2 million. The total consideration was paid in the third quarter of 2016. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, $1.8 million and $2.6 million in deferred costs were included in other noncurrent assets. The deferred costs are being amortized ratably over the four-year term of the agreement. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company has amortized $0.8 million and $0.6 million of such costs, respectively, which was recorded as a reduction of product revenues in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
     In August 2017, the Company entered into the 2017 Term Loan agreement with OrbiMed and issued 300,000 shares of its common stock in exchange for OrbiMed’s initial and remaining funding commitments (as described in Note 8). The Company also paid legal fees totaling $0.3 million in connection with this term loan. Total debt issuance costs of $2.7 million is accounted for as a debt discount. For financial statement presentation purposes, the Company has classified $2.0 million of the debt discount as a direct reduction from the outstanding debt balance, while $0.7 million of such remains in other noncurrent assets for the unused borrowing capacity of $25.0 million. The debt discount is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the loan. For the year ended December 31, 2017, amortization of debt discount related to the unused borrowing capacity was insignificant. As of December 31, 2017, the unamortized portion of the debt discount remained at $0.6 million.

     During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reserved an additional $4.2 million for refunds to insurance carriers. Amounts totaling $4.9 million previously held in reserves from payers were released and recognized as product revenues in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
                     6. Commitments and Contingencies
     Operating Leases 
     As of December 31, 2017, the Company leases office facilities under non‑cancelable operating lease agreements. The Company currently occupies approximately 113,000 square feet of laboratory and office space at its San Carlos, California corporate headquarters pursuant to a lease that it directly entered into with its landlord in October 2016. This lease covers two office spaces (the “First Space and the “Second Space”). The First Space covers approximately 88,000 square feet at a base rent of $319,095. The Second Space covers approximately 25,000 square feet at a base rent of $97,431 per month. The Company paid a security deposit totaling $0.7 million on this lease. The term of this lease is approximately 84 months and expires in October 2023.
     In October 2016, the Company entered into a sublease for additional office space in Redwood City, California that covers approximately 13,000 square feet. The lease term of the additional space began in November 2016 and carried a monthly base rent of $49,140, subject to an annual increase of 3%, with a security deposit of $0.1 million. The term of this sublease is approximately 28 months and expires in February 2019.
      In September 2015, the Company’s subsidiary entered into a long-term lease agreement for laboratory and office space totaling approximately 94,000 square feet in Austin, Texas. The lease term is 132 months beginning in December 2015 and expiring in November 2026 with monthly payments beginning in December 2016, increasing from $0.1 million to $0.2 million. Pursuant to the terms of the lease, the subsidiary paid a security deposit of $0.4 million, and the landlord allotted the subsidiary an allowance for leasehold improvements of up to $7.8 million. As of December 31, 2017, the full amount of the allowance has been reimbursed by the landlord.

      Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $7.2 million, $5.4 million and $2.7 million, respectively. The Company is also required to pay its share of facility operating expenses with respect to the facilities in which it operates.
     Legal Proceedings
     From time to time, the Company is involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. The Company is aggressively defending its current litigation matters, and while there can be no assurances and the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, the Company currently believes that there are no existing claims or proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial position. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these actions or other third-party claims against the Company may cause the Company to incur costly litigation and/or substantial settlement charges.
     In addition, the resolution of any intellectual property litigation may require the Company to make royalty payments, which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods. If this were to occur, the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from the Company's estimates, if any, which could result in the need to record or adjust a liability and record additional expenses. During the periods presented, the Company has not recorded any accrual for loss contingencies associated with such legal proceedings, determined that an unfavorable outcome is probable or reasonably possible, or determined that the amount or range of any possible loss is reasonably estimable, except for the amount accrued in connection with the settlement agreement with the United States Department of Justice described below.
     On each of February 17, 2016, March 10, 2016, March 28, 2016 and April 4, 2016, purported class action lawsuits were filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Mateo (the “San Mateo Superior Court”), against Natera, its directors, certain of its officers and 5% stockholders and their affiliates, and each of the underwriters of the Company’s July 1, 2015 initial public offering (the "IPO"). The complaints assert claims under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The complaints allege, among other things, that the Registration Statement and Prospectus for the Company’s IPO contained materially false or misleading statements, and/or omitted material information that was required to be disclosed, about the Company’s business and prospects. Among other relief, the complaints seek class certification, unspecified compensatory damages, rescission, attorneys' fees, and costs. The Company removed these actions to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and the actions were subsequently remanded back to the San Mateo Superior Court. The Company has appealed the remand and discovery has been stayed, or held, pending the appeal. The Company also filed a demurrer, or a request for dismissal as a matter of law, in the San Mateo Superior Court, which was granted on October 23, 2017.  The San Mateo Superior Court demurred the claims under Sections 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, without leave to re-file. The San Mateo Superior Court granted the demurrer as to Section 11 of the Act with leave to re-file prior to November 24, 2017.  Plaintiffs refiled an amended complaint on November 22, 2017. The Company filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on January 25, 2018. The Company intends to continue to defend the matter vigorously, but cannot provide any assurance as to the ultimate outcome or that an adverse resolution would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. The Company is unable to predict 

 
  114

 
the ultimate outcome and is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, that could result from any unfavorable outcome.
     On March 4, 2016, a lawsuit was filed against the Company in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of San Diego, by a patient alleging that Natera failed to perform a carrier screening test that was ordered. The complaint seeks compensatory damages. On May 26, 2017, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment, which was denied. The matter is set for trial in March 2018. The Company intends to vigorously defend against the claims in this lawsuit, and assert any counterclaims that may be available to it. The Company cannot provide any assurance as to the ultimate outcome or that an adverse resolution of this lawsuit would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. The Company is unable to predict the outcome and is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, that could result from any unfavorable outcome.
     On December 12, 2015, the Company received a civil investigative demand from the United States Department of Justice in connection with a qui tam action related to past reimbursement submissions for some of its testing. The qui tam action was originally filed under seal by the relators on January 26, 2015 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. The qui tam complaint alleged that Natera submitted false claims to government health care programs for its testing services performed during the period from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016, and sought damages and penalties. The complaint was unsealed on February 8, 2018. On March 7, 2018, the Company reached agreement with the United States Department of Justice to resolve all claims made against it in the action. Under the settlement agreement, the Company will pay a total of approximately $11.4 million to the federal government and the participating state Medicaids, of which approximately $5.3 million plus applicable interest will be paid in four equal quarterly installments, subject to the Company’s option to prepay without penalty. In exchange for the payment of the settlement amounts, the United States and the relators agreed to release the Company from certain claims, including civil or administrative monetary relief sought under the complaint. The settlement agreement does not contain or represent an admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company, and there will be no corporate integrity agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a charge of $11.4 million associated with this settlement in its statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2017, the Company classified $10.1 million of this settlement in other accrued liabilities and the remaining $1.3 million in other long-term liabilities.
     Director and Officer Indemnifications
     As permitted under Delaware law, and as set forth in the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and its Bylaws, the Company indemnifies its directors, executive officers, other officers, employees and other agents for certain events or occurrences that may arise while in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under this indemnification is unlimited; however, the Company has insurance policies that may limit its exposure and may enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. Assuming the applicability of coverage, the willingness of the insurer to assume coverage, and subject to certain retention, loss limits and other policy provisions, the Company believes any obligations under this indemnification would not be material, other than an initial $1.5 million for securities related claims an $0.3 million for commercial general liability claims. However, no assurances can be given that the covering insurers will not attempt to dispute the validity, applicability, or amount of coverage without expensive litigation against these insurers, in which case the Company may incur substantial liabilities as a result of these indemnification obligations.      Third-Party Payer Reimbursement Audits
     One third-party payer has alleged that it has overpaid the Company, and has demanded recoupment of the alleged overpayments. The Company disagrees with the contentions.
     Contractual Commitments
     As of December 31, 2017, the Company has non‑cancelable contractual commitments with a supplier for approximately $5.1 million and other material supplier commitments for approximately $7.7 million for inventory material used in the laboratory testing process.       
 
  115

 

 As of December 31, 2017, the Company has a non-cancelable license agreement with a vendor for approximately $2.0 million. This represents binding and remaining commitments with the vendor through December 31, 2019.
     As of December 31, 2017, the Company has a non-cancelable contractual commitments with a vendor for biological sample processing and storage totaling approximately $1.1 million for the next 12 months. 
         7.    Stock‑Based Compensation
     Equity Plans
     2015 Equity Incentive Plan
     General.    The Company’s board of directors adopted its 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2015 Plan, in June 2015. The Company’s 2015 Plan replaced its 2007 Stock Plan. 
     No further awards have been made under the 2007 Plan after July 1, 2015, the date of the Company’s initial public offering. However, any remaining awards that were outstanding under the 2007 Plan will continue to be governed by the terms of that plan. As of December 31 2017, there were 5,551,616 shares outstanding under the 2007 Plan, with exercise prices ranging from $0.0978 to $12.8501.
     Share Reserve.    The initial number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for issuance under the 2015 Plan was 3,451,495 shares. As of December 31, 2017, 14,567,816 shares were reserved for future issuance under the 2015 plan, which includes unissued and forfeited shares from the 2007 plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan will be increased automatically on the first business day of each fiscal year, commencing in 2016, by a number equal to the smallest of:
    
· | 3,500,000 shares;
--+------------------


· | 4% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the last business day of the prior fiscal year; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

      Stock options vest as determined by the compensation committee. In general, they will vest over a four-year period following the date of grant. Stock options expire at the time determined by the compensation committee but in no event more than ten years after they are granted. These awards generally expire earlier if the participant's service terminates earlier. 
     Restricted Shares and Stock Units. Restricted shares and stock units may be awarded under the 2015 Plan in return for any lawful consideration, and participant who receive restricted shares or stock units generally are not required to pay cash for their awards. In general, these awards will be subject to vesting. Vesting may be based on length of service, the attainment of performance-based milestones or a combination of both, as determined by the compensation committee. 
     2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
     General.    The Company’s 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2015 ESPP, was adopted by its board of directors in June 2015 and its stockholders approved it in June 2015. The 2015 ESPP is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    
 
  116

 

 Share Reserve. The Company has reserved 893,548 shares of its common stock for issuance under the 2015 ESPP. As of December 31, 2017, 1,136,615 shares were available for issuance under the 2015 ESPP. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2015 ESPP will automatically be increased on the first business day of each of the Company’s fiscal years, commencing in 2016, by a number equal to the least of:
    
· | 880,000 shares;
--+----------------


· | 1% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the last business day of the prior fiscal year; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

      The number of shares reserved under the 2015 ESPP will automatically be adjusted in the event of a stock split, stock dividend or a reverse stock split (including an adjustment to the per-purchase period share limit).
     Purchase Price. Employees may purchase each share of common stock under the 2015 ESPP at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of the six-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the ESPP are limited to 15% of the compensation, and up to a maximum of 5,000 shares may be purchased during any offering period. A participant shall not be granted an option under the ESPP if such option would permit the participant’s rights to purchase stock to accrue at a rate exceeding $25,000 fair market value of stock for each calendar year in which such option is outstanding at any time.
     Offering Periods. Each offering period will last a number of months determined by the compensation committee, not to exceed 27 months. A new offering period will begin periodically, as determined by the compensation committee. Offering periods may overlap or may be consecutive. Unless otherwise determined by the compensation committee, two offering periods of six months' duration will begin in each year on May 1 and November 1. 
     The first offering period of 2017 started on November 1, 2016 and ended on April 30, 2017, and 211,729 shares were purchased at the end of this offering period for total proceeds of $1.5 million. The second offering period of 2017 started on May 1, 2017 and ended on October 31, 2017, and 234,452 shares were purchased at the end of this offering period for total proceeds of $1.8 million.
     Early Exercise of Employee Options 
     As of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately 1.3 million unvested shares outstanding that are subject to a repurchase right held by the Company at the original issuance price in the event that the optionee’s employment is terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Effective in the year ended December 31, 2015, pursuant to the agreements with the option holders, the Company changed its estimated expiration of its repurchase right for these 1.3 million unvested shares outstanding that are subject to repurchase right held by it through the 210 days after the date of the prospectus filed in connection with the Company’s IPO. Accordingly, the unrecognized compensation expense is being accelerated over a shorter performance period through January 2016. As a result of this acceleration, the Company recorded an additional $1.3 million in stock-based compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2015.

     Performance-based Awards
    
In June 2017, the Board approved a stock option grant of 425,000 shares to the Company’s chief executive officer, of which 200,000 shares are performance-based options. The vesting of these performance-based options is contingent upon the completion of requisite service for the next three years and the achievement of certain milestones within such period. The milestones are (i) to successfully secure a specified strategic arrangement, at which point 50,000 shares will begin vesting over one year in equal quarterly installments, (ii) to successfully secure a specified licensing arrangement, at which point 75,000 shares will begin vesting over one year in equal quarterly installments, and (iii) to successfully secure specified licensing arrangements related to oncology, at which point 75,000 shares will begin vesting over one year in equal quarterly installments. Each milestone is independent of the other.
    
For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company did not recognize any compensation expense associated with the performance-based options since none of the milestones were achieved or were probable of being achieved.

      Stock‑Based Compensation Expense
     Employee and non‑employee stock‑based compensation expense was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and have been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
     The following table presents the effect of employee and non‑employee stock‑based compensation expense on selected statements of operations line items for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

          As of December 31, 2017, approximately $20.0 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested option awards and RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures. The unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized over a weighted‑average period of approximately 2.52 years.
     Valuation of Stock Option Grants to Employees
     The Company estimates the fair value of its stock options granted to employees on the grant date using the Black‑Scholes option‑pricing model. The fair value of employee stock options is amortized on a straight‑line basis over 

 
  119

 
the requisite service period of the awards, generally the vesting period. The fair value of employee stock options was estimated using the following assumptions:

      Valuation of Stock Option Grants to Non-Employees 
     Total options outstanding as of December 31, 2017 include 135,746 shares of option awards that were granted to non-employees, of which 3,401 shares are unvested. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options granted to non-employees is recognized as the stock option is earned and the services are rendered. The Company believes that the estimated fair value of the stock options is more readily measurable than the fair value of the services rendered. The fair value of the stock options granted to non-employees is calculated at each reporting date using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model with the following assumptions: 

 | Year ended December 31,
 | 2017 | | | 2016 | | 2015 | 
Expected term (years) | 2.67 | | — | 2.71 | | 2.65 | | — | 3.16 | | 4.94 | | — | 9.78 | 
Expected volatility | 41.22 | % | — | 52.18 | % | 50.90 | % | — | 72.61 | % | 70.17 | % | — | 75.35 | %
Expected dividend rate | | | | 0 | % | | | | 0 | % | | | | 0 | %
Risk-free interest rate | 1.42 | % | — | 1.95 | % | 0.68 | % | — | 1.38 | % | 1.74 | % | — | 2.24 | %

      Expected Term:    The expected term of options represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. For granted "at-the-money" stock options for employees, the Company estimated the expected term by using the simplified method up until December 31, 2015, which involved calculating the average of the time-to-vesting and the total contractual life of the options. Starting January 1, 2016, the Company uses a different approach by calculating the average of—(1) its employees’ historical stock options exercise behavior, and (2) the weighted-average of the time-to-vesting and the total contractual life of the options. For employee stock options that are not granted "at-the-money," the Company uses the binomial lattice model to calculate the expected term. Regarding non-employee stock options, the Company estimated the expected term by assessing their historical exercise behavior and length of service, and calculated the average of these two components.
     Expected Volatility:    The Company derived the expected volatility from the average historical volatilities of comparable publicly traded companies within its peer group over a period approximately equal to the expected term. 
     Expected Dividend Rate:    The Company has not paid and does not anticipate paying any dividends in the near future. 
     Risk-Free Interest Rate:    The risk-free interest rate assumption is based on U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the expected term.
                     8.   Debt
     Credit Line Agreement
     In September 2015, the Company entered into a credit line with UBS (the “Credit Line”) providing for a $50.0 million revolving line of credit which can be drawn down in increments at any time. In October 2015, the Company borrowed $32.0 million against the Credit Line, primarily to prepay all outstanding amounts under the Secured Loan Arrangement with ROS. The Credit Line currently bears interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 1.10%. The Credit Line is secured by a first priority lien and security interest in the Company’s money market and marketable securities held in its managed 

 
  120

 
investment account with UBS. UBS has the right to demand full or partial payment of the Credit Line Obligations and terminate the Credit Line, in its discretion and without cause, at any time.  
     In November 2015, the Company borrowed an additional $10.0 million under the Credit Line to provide working capital, which increased the total principal amount outstanding to $42.0 million. In June 2016, the Company borrowed an additional $8.0 million and repaid $1.0 million on the Credit Line, thereby increasing the total principal amount outstanding to $49.0 million, with accrued interest of $0.6 million as of December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, additional interest of $1.0 million was accrued, of which interest payments totaling $0.5 million have been made by the Company. As of December 31, 2017, accrued interest was $1.1 million, and the total principal amount outstanding including accrued interest was $50.1 million.
     2017 Term Loan
    
In August 2017, the Company entered into the 2017 Term Loan with OrbiMed, which has a maximum borrowing capacity of $100.0 million. On the closing date of August 8, 2017, the Company borrowed $75.0 million, with the remaining $25.0 million available to borrow at the Company’s option at any time through December 31, 2018, subject to standard conditions. The amounts borrowed under 2017 Term Loan will primarily be used for general corporate purposes and to fund and support the Company’s business and operations. Interest is accrued on the outstanding balance of the loan at a rate equal to the sum of (i) 8.75% plus (ii) the higher of 1.00% or LIBOR. The 2017 Term Loan has an eighty-four month term and will mature in August 2024. The Company is required to make interest payments on a quarterly basis, with repayment of the full outstanding balance on the maturity date. The Company’s obligations under the 2017 Term Loan are secured by substantially all of its assets, including its intellectual property, subject to certain customary exceptions. 

The 2017 Term Loan contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including financial information maintenance covenants, indebtedness limitation covenants, minimum net revenues covenants, and investment covenants. It also includes standard events of default such as payment defaults and nonperformance of obligations and covenants described above. Upon an event of default, an additional interest of 3.00% may be applied to the outstanding debt balance until such default is cured, and OrbiMed may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable. As of December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the 2017 Term Loan.

The Company is allowed to voluntarily make prepayments on its outstanding debt balance either partially or in full. When prepayments are made, an additional prepayment premium will be applied to the outstanding principal amount at the time. The prepayment premium will gradually reduce from 12.5% to 2.5% over the term of the loan.

On August 14, 2017, the Company paid OrbiMed a fee in consideration of providing the 2017 Term Loan by issuing 300,000 shares of its common stock. The fair value of the fee was $2.4 million, which was determined based on the Company’s stock price of $8.16 on August 8, 2017. Additionally, the Company paid legal fees of $0.3 million in connection with this term loan. Total debt issuance costs incurred amounted to $2.7 million, which is accounted for as a debt discount to be amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the loan. The Company has classified $2.0 million of the debt discount as a direct reduction from the outstanding debt balance of $75.0 million, while the remainder is classified as noncurrent assets (as described in Note 5).

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded total interest expense of $3.2 million, of which $0.1 million was the amortization of debt discount. As of December 31, 2017, no principal repayment has been made as the Company is not required to repay the outstanding balance until August 2024.

The following table indicates how the Company reported its long-term debt as of December 31, 2017:

 | 2017 Term Loan | 
 | (in thousands) | 
Principal balance at December 31, 2017 | $ | 75,000

 9. Warrants
     In April 2014, the Company granted warrants to purchase approximately 376,691 warrants to purchase common stock with an exercise price of $2.3229 per common share. The warrants were granted to ROS Acquisition Offshore LP in connection with the Company’s senior secured term loan that has since been repaid and have an expiration date of April 18, 2023. It was determined that the warrants granted are detachable and therefore are a stand-alone component of the senior secured term loan to be fair valued using Level III inputs as a separate derivative.  As of December 31, 2017, these warrants remained exercisable for common stock.     10. Common Stock
     The Company's board of directors and stockholders approved an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to effect a 1-for-1.63 reverse split of its capital stock, which was effected on June 19, 2015. All references to common stock, options to purchase common stock, restricted stock, share data, per share data, warrants, convertible preferred stock and related information have been retroactively adjusted where applicable in this report to reflect the reverse stock split of the Company's capital stock as if it had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.     11. Income Taxes 
     The Company's effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate as follows: 
    
 | Year Ended December 31, |

      During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded total income tax expense of $0.4 million. The Company provides testing to clinics and also licenses its cloud-based software to licensees that are based in a foreign country, which contributed to a foreign income tax expense of $0.2 million. Total income tax expense also included a state income tax expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company did not record any income tax expense given its history of losses, with the exception of $0.1 million of foreign withholding tax in 2016. As the provision for income taxes was not significant for the year ended December 31, 2015, any income taxes were reclassified out of other income and expenses.

 Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The components of the net deferred income tax assets are as follows:
    
 | December 31, | 
 | 2017 | | 2016 | 
 | (in thousands) | 
Deferred tax assets: | | | | | 
Net operating loss carryforwards | $ | 77,356 | | $ | 68,504 
Research and development tax credit carryforwards | | 12,675 | | | 8,634 
Reserves and accruals | | 3,404 | | | 5,719 
Stock-based compensation | | 2,929 | | | 3,220

Deferred tax liabilities: | | | | | 
Property and equipment | | (547) | | | (471) 
Net deferred tax assets | $ | — | | $ | — 

      The Company established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in 2017 and 2016 due to the uncertainty surrounding realization of these assets. The valuation allowance increased to $95.8 million as of December 31, 2017 from $85.6 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase in the valuation allowance was primarily driven by the net loss in the year ended December 31, 2017, current year credits, and the adoption of ASU 2016-09, offset by a decrease resulting from lower federal tax rate.
     In December 2017, the U.S. Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. As a result, corporate tax rate was reduced to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires entities to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment. Shortly after the enactment of the Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when an entity does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Act. The Company has made adjustments to reduce its deferred tax assets and liabilities by $42.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, based on the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 34% to 21% and assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on its current understanding of the provisions of the new law. A corresponding net reduction to valuation allowance of $42.2 million has been made for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company considers its accounting for the impacts of the new law to be provisional and the Company will continue to assess the impact of the recently enacted tax law (and expected further guidance from federal and state tax authorities as well as further guidance for the associated income tax accounting) on its business and consolidated financial statements over the next 12 months. 
     As of December 31, 2017, the Company had federal and state net operating loss (“NOLs”) carryforwards of approximately $319.6 million and $165.5 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2027 and 2028, respectively, if not utilized. As a result of certain realization requirements of ASC 718, the deferred tax assets and liabilities shown in the table above do not include certain deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 that arose directly from the tax deductions related to equity compensation in excess of compensation recognized for financial statement presentation purposes. These deferred tax assets were recorded upon the adoption of ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017.
     The Company also had federal research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $11.7 million, which begin to expire in 2028, and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $8.1 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely. Realization of these deferred tax assets would require $382.8 million in taxable income to fully utilize. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss and credit carryforwards. 
    
 
  123

 

 Federal and California tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of NOLs and credit carryforwards in the event of an "ownership change" for tax purpose, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, the Company's ability to utilize these carryforwards may be limited as the result of such ownership change. Such a limitation could result in limitation in the use of the NOLs in future years and possibly a reduction of the NOLs available. 
     A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 
    
 | Year Ended December 31, | 
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 
 | (in thousands) | 
Balance at beginning of year | $ | 4,293 | | $ | 2,405 | $ | 1,360
Additions based on tax positions related to the current year | | 1,651 | | | 1,836 | | 1,045
Additions for tax positions of prior years | | 1 | | | 52 | | — 
Balance at end of year | $ | 5,945 | | $ | 4,293 | $ | 2,405

      The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10-50, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, on January 1, 2009. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased $1.7 million, $1.9 million, and $1.0 million, respectively, due to additional research and development credits generated during the year. As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $5.9 million, $4.3 million and $2.4 million, respectively. The reversal of the uncertain tax benefits would not affect the Company's effective tax rate to the extent that it continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.
     The Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxes and to income taxes in various states in the United States. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations, and require significant judgment to apply. The Company is subject to U.S. federal, state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for all prior tax years since incorporation. The Company does not anticipate significant changes to its current uncertain tax positions through December 31, 2018.
     The Company recognizes any interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense.  As of December 31, 2017, there were no accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
         12. Related‑Party Transactions 
     The Company entered into a full recourse promissory note with the Company’s chief executive officer, in April 2012 whereby the Company loaned Dr. Rabinowitz $154,000. This interest only loan bore interest at a rate per annum of 1.15%, compounded annually. This loan, including all accrued interest, was repaid in full by Dr. Rabinowitz in May 2015. 
     The Company entered into a full recourse promissory note with Jonathan Sheena, the Company’s chief technology officer, in April 2012 whereby the Company loaned Mr. Sheena $38,280. This interest only loan bore interest at a rate per annum of 1.15%, compounded annually. This loan, including all accrued interest, was repaid in full by Mr. Sheena in May 2015.
     13. Net Loss per Share
     Basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Prior to the Company’s IPO in July 2015, the Company’s convertible preferred stock was entitled to receive dividends, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend on common stock and thereafter participate pro rata on an as converted basis with the common stock holders on any distributions to common stockholders. The convertible preferred shares were therefore considered to be participating securities. As a result, the Company calculated the net loss per share using the two-class method. Accordingly, the net loss attributable to common stockholders is derived from the net loss for the period and, in periods in which the Company has net income attributable to common stockholders, an adjustment is made for the noncumulative dividends and allocations of earnings to participating securities based on their outstanding 

 
  124

 
shareholder rights. Under the two-class method, the net loss attributable to common stockholders is not allocated to the convertible preferred stock as the convertible preferred stock did not have a contractual obligation to share in the Company’s losses. 
     In periods when the Company has incurred a net loss, common stock equivalents such as outstanding common stock options, restricted stock units, unvested common shares subject to repurchase and warrants are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share as they give an anti-dilutive effect.
     For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reversed $1.1 million of remeasurement gain on the change in the fair value of warrants from its net loss and included the incremental shares from the assumed exercise of the warrants in the computation of its weighted-average shares outstanding as they yielded a dilutive effect to the net loss per share in the period. Other potentially dilutive common stock equivalents such as outstanding common stock options, shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan, and restricted stock units were excluded as their effect was anti-dilutive and the net loss per share would be reduced.
     The following table provides the basic and diluted net loss per share computations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

     15.    Subsequent Events
     In January 2018, the Company amended its existing agreement with an insurance carrier, which provides the Company access to contact information of certain referring and ordering physicians and includes the Company as a member of its Preferred Provider Network. The Company will pay a total consideration of approximately $2.0 million over a two-year period in exchange such benefits.
     In February 2018, the Company amended its existing agreement with one of its laboratory partners to extend the original term of the agreement for two additional years, provided that the agreement is not canceled by the Company on December 31, 2018. The amended agreement expires on December 31, 2020 and requires material commitments from the Company to purchase certain number of tests annually. 

 In March 2018, the Company reached settlement with the United States Department of Justice related to reimbursement related claims. This settlement agreement requires the Company to pay a total of approximately $11.4 million, of which approximately $5.6 million including applicable interest was secured by a letter of credit, will be paid in four equal installments, subject to the Company’s option to prepay without penalty. See Legal Proceedings under Note 6 for more detail.
     In March 2018, the Company entered into a Distribution Agreement with Qiagen to develop, manufacture, distribute and commercialize NGS-based genetic testing assays for clinical use based on the Company’s proprietary Panorama NIPT technology. According to the agreement, the Company will receive a total of $40.0 million before March 31, 2018. Additionally, the Company is entitled to potential milestone payments totaling $10.0 million from Qiagen upon the achievement of certain volume, regulatory and commercial milestones. The Distribution Agreement has a term of 10 years and expires in March 2028.
