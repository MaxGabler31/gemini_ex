 SP – Security Products business 
 MC – Marine Components business 
  
(1) | ISO-9001 registered facilities
----+-------------------------------

 We believe all of CompX’s facilities are well maintained and satisfactory for their intended purposes. 
 Raw materials - The primary raw materials used in CompX’s manufacturing processes are: 
  
• | zinc and brass (used in the Security Products business for the manufacture of locking mechanisms); and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | stainless steel (used primarily in the Marine Components business for the manufacture of exhaust headers and pipes), aluminum (used for the manufacture of throttles and trim tabs), and other components.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These raw materials are purchased from several suppliers, are readily available from numerous sources and accounted for approximately 11% of our total cost of sales for 2017.  Total material costs, including purchased components, represented approximately 44% of our cost of sales in 2017.
 CompX occasionally enters into short-term commodity-related raw material supply arrangements to mitigate the impact of future price increases in commodity-related raw materials, including zinc, brass and stainless steels.  These arrangements generally provide for stated unit prices based upon specified purchase volumes, which help CompX to stabilize its commodity-related raw material costs to a certain extent.  During 2016 and 2017, markets for the primary commodity-related raw materials used in the manufacture of CompX’s locking mechanisms, primarily zinc and brass, generally strengthened, resulting in price increases that exceeded general inflation rates.  In the case of zinc, CompX’s purchases late in 2017 bore unit costs over 50% higher than those acquired two years earlier.  Over that same period, the market for stainless steel, the primary raw material used for the manufacture of marine exhaust headers and pipes, remained relatively stable.  While CompX expects the markets for its primary commodity-related raw materials to stabilize during 2018, CompX recognizes that strengthening economic conditions may exert upward price pressure on these and other manufacturing materials. When purchased on the spot market, each of these raw materials may be subject to sudden and unanticipated price increases.  CompX generally seeks to mitigate the impact

of fluctuations in these raw material costs on its margins through improvements in production efficiencies or other operating cost reductions.  In the event CompX is unable to offset raw material cost increases with other cost reductions, it may be difficult to recover those cost increases through increased product selling prices or raw material surcharges due to the competitive nature of the markets served by CompX’s products.  Consequently, overall operating margins can be affected by commodity-related raw material cost pressures.  Commodity market prices are cyclical, reflecting overall economic trends, specific developments in consuming industries and speculative investor activities. 
 Patents and trademarks - CompX holds a number of patents relating to component products, certain of which we believe to be important to CompX and its continuing business activity.  Patents generally have a term of 20 years, and CompX’s patents have remaining terms ranging from less than 1 year to 17 years at December 31, 2017.  
 CompX’s major trademarks and brand names in addition to CompX® include:

Sales, marketing and distribution - A majority of CompX’s component sales are direct to large OEM customers through our factory-based sales and marketing professionals supported by engineers working in concert with field salespeople and independent manufacturer’s representatives.  We select manufacturer’s representatives based on special skills in certain markets or relationships with current or potential customers.  
 In addition to sales to large OEM customers, a substantial portion of CompX’s Security Products sales are made through distributors.  We have a significant North American market share of cabinet lock security product sales as a result of the locksmith distribution channel.  We support our locksmith distributor sales with a line of standardized products used by the largest segments of the marketplace.  These products are packaged and merchandised for easy availability and handling by distributors and end users.  
 We sell to a diverse customer base with only one customers representing 10% or more of our sales in 2017 (United States Postal Service representing 16%).  Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 44% of our sales in 2017.    
 Competition - The markets in which CompX participates are highly competitive.  CompX competes primarily on the basis of product design, including space utilization and aesthetic factors, product quality and durability, price, on-time delivery, service and technical support.  CompX focuses its efforts on the middle and high-end segments of the market, where product design, quality, durability and service are valued by the customer.  The Security Products business competes against a number of U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturers.  The Marine Components business competes with small U.S. manufacturers and is minimally affected by non-U.S. competitors.  
 - 6 -


Regulatory and environmental matters - CompX’s operations are subject to federal, state and local  environmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation, treatment, emission, discharge, disposal, remediation of and exposure to hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes (“Environmental Laws”).  CompX’s operations are also subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to worker health and safety.  We believe that CompX is in substantial compliance with all such laws and regulations.  To date, the costs of maintaining compliance with such laws and regulations have not significantly impacted our results of operations.  We currently do not anticipate any significant costs or expenses relating to such matters; however, it is possible future laws and regulations may require us to incur significant additional expenditures.  
 Employees - As of December 31, 2017, CompX employed 520 people, all in the United States.  We believe our labor relations are good at all of our facilities.
 CHEMICALS - KRONOS WORLDWIDE, INC.  
 Business overview - Kronos is a leading global producer and marketer of value-added titanium dioxide pigments, or TiO2, a base industrial product used in a wide range of applications.  Kronos, along with its distributors and agents, sells and provides technical services for its products to approximately 4,000 customers in 100 countries with the majority of sales in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific.  We believe that Kronos has developed considerable expertise and efficiency in the manufacture, sale, shipment and service of its products in domestic and international markets.  
 TiO2 is a white inorganic pigment used in a wide range of products for its exceptional durability and its ability to impart whiteness, brightness and opacity.  TiO2 is a critical component of everyday applications, such as coatings, plastics and paper, as well as many specialty products such as inks, food and cosmetics.  TiO2 is widely considered to be superior to alternative white pigments in large part due to its hiding power (or opacity), which is the ability to cover or mask other materials effectively and efficiently.  TiO2 is designed, marketed and sold based on specific end-use applications.  
 TiO2 is the largest commercially used whitening pigment because it has a high refractive rating, giving it more hiding power than any other commercially produced white pigment.  In addition, TiO2 has excellent resistance to interaction with other chemicals, good thermal stability and resistance to ultraviolet degradation. Although there are other white pigments on the market, Kronos believes that there are no effective substitutes for TiO2 because no other white pigment has the physical properties for achieving comparable opacity and brightness or can be incorporated in as cost-effective a manner.  Pigment extenders such as kaolin clays, calcium carbonate and polymeric opacifiers are used together with TiO2 in a number of end-use markets.  However, these products are not able to duplicate the opacity performance characteristics of TiO2 and Kronos believes that these products are unlikely to have a significant impact on the use of TiO2.  
 TiO2 is considered a “quality-of-life” product.  Demand for TiO2 has generally been driven by worldwide gross domestic product and has generally increased with rising standards of living in various regions of the world.  According to industry estimates, TiO2 consumption has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3% since 1990.  Per capita consumption of TiO2 in Western Europe and the United States far exceeds that in other areas of the world, and these regions are expected to continue to be the largest consumers of TiO2 on a per capita basis.  We believe that Western Europe and North America currently account for approximately 20% and 17% of global TiO2 consumption, respectively.  Markets for TiO2 are generally increasing in South America, Eastern Europe, the Asia Pacific region and China and we believe these are significant markets where we expect continued growth as economies in these regions continue to develop and quality-of-life products, including TiO2, experience greater demand.
 - 7 -


Products and end-use markets - Kronos, including its predecessors, has produced and marketed TiO2 in North America and Europe, its primary markets, for over 100 years.  We believe that Kronos is the largest producer of TiO2 in Europe with approximately one-half of its sales volumes attributable to markets in Europe.  The table below shows Kronos’ market share for its significant markets, Europe and North America, for the last three years.
 
 
 | 2015 | | 2016 | 2017
Europe | | 18 | % | | 17 | % | 17 | %
North America | | 15 | % | | 16 | % | 18 | %

 We believe that Kronos is the leading seller of TiO2 in several countries, including Germany, with an estimated 10% share of worldwide TiO2 sales volume in 2017.  Overall, Kronos is one of the top six producers of TiO2 in the world.
 Kronos offers its customers a broad portfolio of products that includes over 40 different TiO2 pigment grades under the Kronos® trademark, which provide a variety of performance properties to meet customers’ specific requirements.  Kronos’ major customers include domestic and international paint, plastics, decorative laminate and paper manufacturers.  Kronos ships TiO2 to customers in either a powder or slurry form via rail, truck and/or ocean carrier.  Sales of its core TiO2 pigments represented approximately 94% of Kronos’ net sales in 2017.  Kronos and its agents and distributors primarily sell its products in three major end-use markets: coatings, plastics and paper.  
 The following tables show Kronos’ approximate TiO2 sales volume by geographic region and end use for the year ended December 31, 2017: 
 
 
Sales volumes percentages by geographic region | | Sales volumes percentages by end-use
-----------------------------------------------+----+-------------------------------------
Europe | 50 | % | Coatings | 58 | %
North America | 31 | % | Plastics | 30 | %
Asia Pacific | 9 | % | Other | 5 | %
Rest of World | 10 | % | Paper | 7 | %

 Some of the principal applications for Kronos’ products include the following. 
 TiO2 for coatings - Kronos’ TiO2 is used to provide opacity, durability, tinting strength and brightness in industrial coatings, as well as coatings for commercial and residential interiors and exteriors, automobiles, aircraft, machines, appliances, traffic paint and other special purpose coatings.  The amount of TiO2 used in coatings varies widely depending on the opacity, color and quality desired.  In general, the higher the opacity requirement of the coating, the greater the TiO2 content. 
 TiO2 for plastics - Kronos produces TiO2 pigments that improve the optical and physical properties in plastics, including whiteness and opacity.  TiO2 is used to provide opacity in items such as containers and packaging materials, and vinyl products such as windows, door profiles and siding.  TiO2 also generally provides hiding power, neutral undertone, brightness and surface durability for housewares, appliances, toys, computer cases and food packages.  TiO2’s high brightness along with its opacity is used in some engineering plastics to help mask their undesirable natural color.  TiO2 is also used in masterbatch, which is a concentrate of TiO2 and other additives and is one of the largest uses for TiO2 in the plastics end-use market.  In masterbatch, the TiO2 is dispersed at high concentrations into a plastic resin and is then used by manufacturers of plastic containers, bottles, packaging and agricultural films. 
 - 8 -


TiO2 for paper - Kronos’ TiO2 is used in the production of several types of paper, including laminate (decorative) paper, filled paper and coated paper to provide whiteness, brightness, opacity and color stability.  Although Kronos sells its TiO2 to all segments of the paper end-use market, its primary focus is on the TiO2 grades used in paper laminates, where several layers of paper are laminated together using melamine resin under high temperature and pressure.  The top layer of paper contains TiO2 and plastic resin and is the layer that is printed with decorative patterns.  Paper laminates are used to replace materials such as wood and tile for such applications as counter tops, furniture and wallboard.  TiO2 is beneficial in these applications because it assists in preventing the material from fading or changing color after prolonged exposure to sunlight and other weathering agents. 
 TiO2 for other applications - Kronos produces TiO2 to improve the opacity and hiding power of printing inks.  TiO2 allows inks to achieve very high print quality while not interfering with the technical requirements of printing machinery, including low abrasion, high printing speed and high temperatures.  Kronos’ TiO2 is also used in textile applications where TiO2 functions as an opacifying and delustering agent.  In man-made fibers such as rayon and polyester, TiO2 corrects an otherwise undesirable glossy and translucent appearance.  Without the presence of TiO2, these materials would be unsuitable for use in many textile applications. 
 Kronos produces high purity sulfate process anatase TiO2 used to provide opacity, whiteness and brightness in a variety of cosmetic and personal care products, such as skin cream, lipstick, eye shadow and toothpaste.  Kronos’ TiO2 is also found in food products, such as candy and confectionaries and in pet foods where it is used to obtain uniformity of color and appearance.  In pharmaceuticals, Kronos’ TiO2 is used commonly as a colorant in pill and capsule coatings as well as in liquid medicines to provide uniformity of color and appearance.  Kronos® purified anatase grades meet the applicable requirements of the CTFA (Cosmetics, Toiletries and Fragrances Association), USP and BP (United States Pharmacopoeia and British Pharmacopoeia) and the FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration).  
 Kronos’ TiO2 business is enhanced by the following three complementary businesses, which comprised approximately 6% of its net sales in 2017: 
  
• | Kronos owns and operates two ilmenite mines in Norway pursuant to a governmental concession with an unlimited term. Ilmenite is a raw material used directly as a feedstock by some sulfate-process TiO2 plants. We believe that Kronos has a significant competitive advantage because its mines supply the feedstock requirements for all of its European sulfate-process plants. Kronos also sells ilmenite ore to third-parties, some of whom are competitors, and Kronos sells an ilmenite-based specialty product to the oil and gas industry. The mines have estimated ilmenite reserves that are expected to last at least 50 years. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Kronos manufactures and sells iron-based chemicals, which are co-products and processed co-products of the sulfate and chloride process TiO2 pigment production. These co-product chemicals are marketed through Kronos’ Ecochem division and are primarily used as treatment and conditioning agents for industrial effluents and municipal wastewater as well as for the manufacture of iron pigments, cement and agricultural products. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Kronos manufactures and sells titanium oxychloride and titanyl sulfate, which are side-stream specialty products from the production of TiO2. Titanium oxychloride is used in specialty applications in the formulation of pearlescent pigments, production of electroceramic capacitors for cell phones and other electronic devices. Titanyl sulfate productions are used in pearlescent pigments, natural gas pipe and other specialty applications. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Manufacturing, operations and properties - Kronos produces TiO2 in two crystalline forms: rutile and anatase.  Rutile TiO2 is manufactured using both a chloride production process and a sulfate production process, whereas anatase TiO2 is only produced using a sulfate production process.  Manufacturers of many end-use applications can use either form, especially during periods of tight supply for TiO2.  The chloride process is the preferred form for use in coatings and plastics, the two largest end-use markets.  Due to environmental factors and customer considerations, the proportion of TiO2 industry sales represented by chloride process pigments has increased relative to sulfate process pigments, and in 2017, chloride process production facilities represented approximately 50% of industry capacity.  The sulfate process is preferred for use in selected paper products, ceramics, rubber tires, man-made fibers, food products, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.  Once an intermediate TiO2 pigment has been produced by either the chloride or sulfate process, it is “finished” into products with specific performance characteristics for particular end-use applications through proprietary processes involving various chemical surface treatments and intensive micronizing (milling).  
  
• | Chloride process - The chloride process is a continuous process in which chlorine is used to extract rutile TiO2. The chloride process produces less waste than the sulfate process because much of the chlorine is recycled and feedstock bearing higher titanium content is used. The chloride process also has lower energy requirements and is less labor-intensive than the sulfate process, although the chloride process requires a higher-skilled labor force. The chloride process produces an intermediate base pigment with a wide range of properties. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sulfate process - The sulfate process is a batch process in which sulfuric acid is used to extract the TiO2 from ilmenite or titanium slag. After separation from the impurities in the ore (mainly iron), the TiO2 is precipitated and calcined to form an intermediate base pigment ready for sale or can be upgraded through finishing treatment. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Kronos produced 576,000 metric tons of TiO2 in 2017, up from the 546,000 metric tons produced in 2016.  Kronos’ production amounts include its share of the output produced by its TiO2 manufacturing joint-venture discussed below in “TiO2 Manufacturing Joint Venture.”  Kronos’ average production capacity utilization rates were approximately 95% and 98% of capacity in 2015 and 2016, respectively, and at full practical capacity in 2017.  Kronos’ production rates in the first quarter of 2015 were impacted by the implementation of certain productivity-enhancing improvement projects at other facilities, as well as necessary improvements to ensure continued compliance with its permit regulations, which resulted in longer-than-normal maintenance shutdowns in some instances.  
 Kronos operates facilities throughout North America and Europe, including the only sulfate process plant in North America and four TiO2 plants in Europe (one in each of Leverkusen, Germany; Nordenham, Germany; Langerbrugge, Belgium; and Fredrikstad, Norway).  In North America, Kronos has a TiO2 plant in Varennes, Quebec, Canada and, through the manufacturing joint venture described below in “TiO2 Manufacturing Joint Venture,” a 50% interest in a TiO2 plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana. 
 Kronos’ production capacity has increased by approximately 6% over the past ten years due to debottlenecking programs, with only moderate capital expenditures.  Kronos currently expects to operate its TiO2 plants at full practical capacity levels in 2018.

(1) | The Leverkusen facility is located within an extensive manufacturing complex owned by Bayer AG. Kronos owns the Leverkusen facility, which represents about one-third of its current TiO2 production capacity, but it leases the land under the facility from Bayer under a long-term agreement which expires in 2050. Lease payments are periodically negotiated with Bayer for periods of at least two years at a time. A majority-owned subsidiary of Bayer provides some raw materials, including chlorine, auxiliary and operating materials, utilities and services necessary to operate the Leverkusen facility under separate supplies and services agreements.

(2) | The Fredrikstad plant is located on public land and is leased until 2063.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Kronos operates the Lake Charles facility in a joint venture with Huntsman P&A Investments LLC (HPA) (formerly Tioxide Americas, LLC), a subsidiary of Huntsman Corporation and the amount indicated in the table above represents the share of TiO2 produced by the joint venture to which Kronos is entitled. See “TiO2 Manufacturing Joint Venture.” 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Kronos owns the land underlying all of its principal production facilities unless otherwise indicated in the table above.  
 Kronos also operates two ilmenite mines in Norway pursuant to a governmental concession with an unlimited term.  In addition, Kronos operates a rutile slurry manufacturing plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana, which converts dry pigment manufactured for Kronos at the Lake Charles TiO2 facility into a slurry form that is then shipped to customers.  
 Kronos has various corporate and administrative offices located in the U.S., Germany, Norway, Canada, Belgium, France and the United Kingdom and various sales offices located in North America. 
 TiO2 Manufacturing Joint Venture - Kronos and HPA each own a 50% interest in a manufacturing joint venture, Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P., or LPC.  LPC owns and operates a chloride-process TiO2 plant located in Lake Charles, Louisiana.  Kronos and Venator share production from the plant equally pursuant to separate offtake agreements, unless we and Venator otherwise agree (such as in 2015, when we purchased approximately 52% of the production from the plant).
 A supervisory committee directs the business and affairs of the joint venture, including production and output decisions.  This committee is composed of four members, two of whom Kronos appoints and two of whom Venator appoints.  Two general managers manage the operations of the joint venture acting under the direction of the supervisory committee.  Kronos appoints one general manager and Venator appoints the other. 
 The joint venture is not consolidated in Kronos’ financial statements, because Kronos does not control it.  Kronos accounts for our interest in the joint venture by the equity method.  The joint venture operates on a break-even 
 - 11 -


basis and therefore Kronos does not have any equity in earnings of the joint venture.  Kronos is required to purchase one half of the TiO2 produced by the joint venture.  All costs and capital expenditures are shared equally with Venator with the exception of feedstock (purchased natural rutile ore or slag) and packaging costs for the pigment grades produced.  Kronos’ share of net costs is reported as cost of sales as the TiO2 is sold.  
 Raw materials - The primary raw materials used in chloride process TiO2 are titanium-containing feedstock (purchased natural rutile ore or slag), chlorine and coke.  Chlorine is available from a number of suppliers, while petroleum coke is available from a limited number of suppliers.  Titanium-containing feedstock suitable for use in the chloride process is available from a limited but increasing number of suppliers principally in Australia, South Africa, Canada, India and the United States.  Kronos purchases chloride process grade slag from Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Limited under a long-term supply contract that automatically renews at the end of 2018 for successive two-year renewal periods, unless terminated before December 31, 2018.  Kronos also purchase upgraded slag from Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Limited under a long-term supply contract that expires at the end of 2019.  Kronos purchases natural rutile ore primarily from Iluka Resources, Limited under a contract which expires in 2018.  In the past Kronos has been, and it expects that it will continue to be, successful in obtaining short-term and long-term extensions to these and other existing supply contracts prior to their expiration.  Kronos expects the raw materials purchased under these contracts, and contracts that Kronos may enter into, will meet its chloride process feedstock requirements over the next several years. 
 The primary raw materials used in sulfate process TiO2 are titanium-containing feedstock, primarily ilmenite or purchased sulfate grade slag and sulfuric acid.  Sulfuric acid is available from a number of suppliers.  Titanium-containing feedstock suitable for use in the sulfate process is available from a limited number of suppliers principally in Norway, Canada, Australia, India and South Africa.  As one of the few vertically-integrated producers of sulfate process TiO2, Kronos operates two rock ilmenite mines in Norway, which provided all of the feedstock for Kronos’ European sulfate process TiO2 plants in 2017.  Kronos expects ilmenite production from its mines to meet Kronos’ European sulfate process feedstock requirements for the foreseeable future.  For Kronos’ Canadian sulfate process plant, Kronos purchases sulfate grade slag primarily from Rio Tinto Fer et Titane Inc. under a supply contract that renews annually, subject to termination upon twelve months written notice.  Kronos expects the raw materials purchased under these contracts, and contracts that it may enter into, to meet Kronos’ sulfate process feedstock requirements over the next several years. 
 Many of Kronos’ raw material contracts contain fixed quantities Kronos is required to purchase, or specify a range of quantities within which Kronos is required to purchase.  The pricing under these agreements is generally negotiated quarterly. 
 The following table summarizes Kronos’ raw materials purchased or mined in 2017.   
 
 
Production process/raw material | Raw materialsprocured or mined
---------------------------------------+-------------------------------
 | (In thousands of metric tons) 
Chloride process plants: | 
Purchased slag or rutile ore | 535 
Sulfate process plants: | 
Ilmenite ore mined and used internally | 360 
Purchased slag | 27 

 Sales and marketing - Kronos’ marketing strategy is aimed at developing and maintaining strong customer relationships with new and existing accounts.  Because TiO2 represents a significant raw material cost for Kronos’ customers, the purchasing decisions are often made by customers’ senior management.  Kronos works to maintain close relationships with the key decision makers, through in-depth and frequent in-person meetings.  Kronos endeavors to extend these commercial and technical relationships to multiple levels within its customers’ organization by using its direct sales force and technical service group to accomplish this objective.  Kronos believes this has helped build customer loyalty to Kronos and strengthen its competitive position.  Close cooperation and strong customer relationships enable Kronos to stay closely attuned to trends in its customers’ businesses.  Where appropriate, Kronos works in conjunction with customers to solve formulation or application problems by modifying specific product 
 - 12 -


properties or developing new pigment grades.  Kronos also focuses its sales and marketing efforts on those geographic and end-use market businesses where Kronos believes it can realize higher selling prices.  This focus includes continuously reviewing and optimizing customer and product portfolios.  
 Kronos’ marketing strategy is also aimed at working directly with customers to monitor the success of its products in their end-use applications, evaluate the need for improvements in product and process technology and identify opportunities to develop new product solutions for its customers.  Kronos’ marketing staff closely coordinates with its sales force and technical specialists to ensure that the needs of its customers are met, and to help develop and commercialize new grades where appropriate.  
 Kronos sells a majority of its products through its direct sales force operating from five sales offices in Europe and two sales offices in North America.  Kronos also utilizes sales agents and distributors who are authorized to sell its products in specific geographic areas.  In Europe, Kronos’ sales efforts are conducted primarily through its direct sales force and its sales agents.  Kronos’ agents do not sell any TiO2 products other than KRONOS® brand products.  In North America, Kronos’ sales are made primarily through its direct sales force and supported by a network of distributors.  In export markets, where we have increased our marketing efforts over the last several years, our sales are made through our direct sales force, sales agents and distributors. In addition to its direct sales force and sales agents, many of Kronos’ sales agents also act as distributors to service its customers in all regions.  Kronos offers customer and technical service to the customers who purchase its products through distributors as well as to its larger customers serviced by its direct sales force.  
 Kronos sells to a diverse customer base and no single customer comprised more than 10% of Kronos’ sales in 2017.  Kronos’ largest ten customers accounted for approximately 34% of sales in 2017.
 Neither Kronos’ business as a whole nor any of its principal product groups is seasonal to any significant extent.  However, TiO2 sales are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, due in part to the increase in paint production in the spring to meet demand during the spring and summer painting seasons.  With certain exceptions, Kronos has historically operated its production facilities at near full capacity rates throughout the entire year, which among other things helps to minimize its per-unit production costs.  As a result, Kronos normally will build inventories during the first and fourth quarters of each year, in order to maximize product availability during the higher demand periods normally experienced in the second and third quarters.  
 Competition - The TiO2 industry is highly competitive.  Kronos competes primarily on the basis of price, product quality, technical service and the availability of high performance pigment grades.  Since TiO2 is not a traded commodity, its pricing is largely a product of negotiation between suppliers and their respective customers.  Price and availability are the most significant competitive factors along with quality and customer service for the majority of our product grades.  Increasingly, we are focused on providing pigments that are differentiated to meet specific customer requests and specialty grades that are differentiated from our competitor’s products.  During 2017, Kronos had an estimated 10% share of worldwide TiO2 sales volume, and based on sales volumes, we believe that Kronos is the leading seller of TiO2 in several countries, including Germany.  
 Kronos’ principal competitors are The Chemours Company, or Chemours;  Cristal Global; Venator Materials PLC (formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary, and now a majority-owned subsidiary, of Huntsman Corporation); Tronox Incorporated; and Lomon Billions.  The top six TiO2 producers (i.e. Kronos and our five principal competitors) account for approximately 66% of the world’s production capacity.  Chemours added a new 200,000 metric ton capacity line at its plant in Mexico which commenced production in the second quarter of 2016.  In 2016, Venator announced it was closing its sulfate process facility in South Africa, reducing its overall capacity by 25,000 metric tons.  In 2017, one of Venator’s European sulfate plants, which has a capacity of 130,000 metric tons, operated at significantly reduced rates due to a fire at the facility.

The following chart shows Kronos’ estimate of worldwide production capacity in 2017: 
 
 
Worldwide production capacity
-----------------------------
Chemours | 18 | %
Cristal | 13 | %
Venator | 10 | %
Lomon Billions | 9 | %
Kronos | 9 | %
Tronox | 7 | %
Other | 34 | %

 
Chemours has over one-half of total North American TiO2 production capacity and is Kronos’ principal North American competitor.  In February 2017, Tronox announced a definitive agreement to acquire the TiO2 assets of Cristal, but in December 2017 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint challenging the merger.  Tronox has indicated it intends to vigorously defend against such action.
 Over the past ten years, Kronos and its competitors have increased industry capacity through debottlenecking projects, which in part compensated for the shutdown of various TiO2 plants throughout the world.  Although overall industry demand is expected to remain strong in 2018 as a result of improving worldwide economic conditions, we do not expect any other significant efforts will be undertaken by us or our principal competitors to further increase capacity for the foreseeable future, other than through debottlenecking projects.  If actual developments differ from our expectations, the TiO2 industry’s performance and that of our own could be unfavorably affected. 
 The TiO2 industry is characterized by high barriers to entry consisting of high capital costs, proprietary technology and significant lead times (typically three to five years in our experience) required to construct new facilities or to expand existing capacity.  Kronos believes it is unlikely any new TiO2 plants will be constructed in Europe or North America in the foreseeable future.  
 Research and development - Kronos employs scientists, chemists, process engineers and technicians who are engaged in research and development, process technology and quality assurance activities in Leverkusen, Germany.  These individuals have the responsibility for improving Kronos’ chloride and sulfate production processes, improving product quality and strengthening Kronos’ competitive position by developing new applications.  Kronos’ expenditures for these activities were approximately $16 million in 2015, $13 million in 2016 and $20 million in 2017.  Kronos expects to spend approximately $19 million on research and development in 2018.  
 Kronos continually seeks to improve the quality of its grades and has been successful at developing new grades for existing and new applications to meet the needs of its customers and increase product life cycles.  Since the beginning of 2013, Kronos has added five new grades for pigments and other applications. 
 Patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights - Kronos has a comprehensive intellectual property protection strategy that includes obtaining, maintaining and enforcing its patents, primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe.  Kronos also protects its trademark and trade secret rights and has entered into license agreements with third parties concerning various intellectual property matters.  Kronos has also from time to time been involved in disputes over intellectual property.  
 Patents - Kronos has obtained patents and has numerous patent applications pending that cover its products and the technology used in the manufacture of its products.  Kronos’ patent strategy is important to Kronos and its continuing business activities.  In addition to maintaining its patent portfolio, Kronos seeks patent protection for its technical developments, principally in the United States, Canada and Europe.  U.S. patents are generally in effect for 20 years from the date of filing.  Kronos’ U.S. patent portfolio includes patents having remaining terms ranging from four years to 20 years.  
 Trademarks and trade secrets - Kronos’ trademarks, including KRONOS®, are covered by issued and/or pending registrations, including in Canada and the United States.  Kronos protects the trademarks that it uses in connection with the products it manufactures and sells and has developed goodwill in connection with its long-term 
 - 14 -


use of Kronos’ trademarks.  Kronos conducts research activities in secret and Kronos protects the confidentiality of its trade secrets through reasonable measures, including confidentiality agreements and security procedures, including data security.  Kronos relies upon unpatented proprietary knowledge and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain its competitive position.  Kronos’ proprietary chloride production process is an important part of Kronos’ technology and its business could be harmed if it fails to maintain confidentiality of its trade secrets used in this technology. 
 Employees - As of December 31, 2017, Kronos employed the following number of people: 
 
 
Europe | 1,835
------------------+------
Canada | 360 
United States (1) | 50 
Total | 2,245


(1) | Excludes employees of Kronos’ Louisiana joint venture.
----+-------------------------------------------------------

 Certain employees at each of Kronos’ production facilities are organized by labor unions.  In Europe, Kronos’ union employees are covered by master collective bargaining agreements for the chemical industry that are generally renewed annually.  In Canada, Kronos’ union employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in June 2018.  At December 31, 2017, approximately 86% of Kronos’ worldwide workforce is organized under collective bargaining agreements.  It is possible that there could be future work stoppages or other labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect Kronos’ business, results of operations, financial position or liquidity.  
 Regulatory and environmental matters - Kronos’ operations and properties are governed by various environmental laws and regulations, which are complex, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time.  These environmental laws govern, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; and the health and safety of employees.  Certain of Kronos’ operations are, or have been, engaged in the generation, storage, handling, manufacture or use of substances or compounds that may be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable environmental laws and regulations.  As with other companies engaged in similar businesses, certain of Kronos’ past and current operations and products have the potential to cause environmental or other damage.  Kronos has implemented and continues to implement various policies and programs in an effort to minimize these risks.  Kronos’ policy is to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations at all of its facilities and to strive to improve environmental performance.  It is possible that future developments, such as stricter requirements in environmental laws and enforcement policies, could adversely affect Kronos’ operations, including production, handling, use, storage, transportation, sale or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or require Kronos to make capital and other expenditures to comply, and could adversely affect its consolidated financial position and results of operations or liquidity.  
 Kronos’ U.S. manufacturing operations are governed by federal, state and local environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations.  These include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, or CERCLA, as well as the state counterparts of these statutes.  Some of these laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination, even if these owners or operators did not know of, and were not responsible for, such contamination.  These laws also assess liability on any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person.  Although Kronos has not incurred and does not currently anticipate any material liabilities in connection with such environmental laws, it may be required to make expenditures for environmental remediation in the future.  
 While the laws regulating operations of industrial facilities in Europe vary from country to country, a common regulatory framework is provided by the European Union, or the EU.  Germany and Belgium are members of the EU and follow its initiatives.  Norway is not a member but generally patterns its environmental regulatory actions after the EU.

At Kronos’ sulfate plant facilities in Germany, it recycles spent sulfuric acid either through contracts with third parties or at its own facilities.  In addition, at Kronos’ German locations it has a contract with a third party to treat certain sulfate-process effluents.  At its Norwegian plant, Kronos ships spent acid to a third party location where it is used as a neutralization agent.  These contracts may be terminated by either party after giving three or four years advance notice, depending on the contract.  
 From time to time, Kronos’ facilities may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under U.S.  and non-U.S. statutes.  Typically Kronos establishes compliance programs to resolve these matters.  Occasionally, Kronos may pay penalties.  To date such penalties have not involved amounts having a material adverse effect on Kronos’ consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  We believe that all of Kronos’ facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws.  
 Kronos’ capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance, protection and improvement programs, including capital expenditures which are primarily focused on increased operating efficiency but also result in improved environmental protection such as lower emissions from its manufacturing facilities, were $16.1 million in 2017 and are currently expected to be approximately $26 million in 2018.

We also hold certain marketable securities and other investments.  See Notes 5 and 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 Regulatory and environmental matters - We discuss regulatory and environmental matters in the respective business sections contained elsewhere herein and in Item 3 - “Legal Proceedings.” In addition, the information included in Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements under the captions “Lead pigment litigation” and “Environmental matters and litigation” is incorporated herein by reference.  
 Insurance - We maintain insurance for our businesses and operations, with customary levels of coverage, deductibles and limits.  See also Item 3 – “Legal Proceedings – Insurance coverage claims” and Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  
 Business strategy - We routinely compare our liquidity requirements and alternative uses of capital against the estimated future cash flows we expect to receive from our subsidiaries and affiliates.  As a result of this process, we have in the past and may in the future seek to raise additional capital, incur debt, repurchase indebtedness in the market, modify our dividend policies, consider the sale of our interests in our subsidiaries, affiliates, business, marketable securities or other assets, or take a combination of these and other steps, to increase liquidity, reduce indebtedness and fund future activities.  Such activities have in the past and may in the future involve related companies.  From time to time, we also evaluate the restructuring of ownership interests among our respective subsidiaries and related companies.  
 We and other entities that may be affiliated with Contran routinely evaluate acquisitions of interests in, or combinations with, companies, including related companies, perceived by management to be undervalued in the marketplace.  These companies may or may not be engaged in businesses related to our current businesses.  In some instances, we have actively managed the businesses acquired with a focus on maximizing return-on-investment through cost reductions, capital expenditures, improved operating efficiencies, selective marketing to address market niches, disposition of marginal operations, use of leverage and redeployment of capital to more productive assets.  In other instances, we have disposed of the acquired interest in a company prior to gaining control.  We intend to consider such activities in the future and may, in connection with such activities, consider issuing additional equity securities and increasing our indebtedness.
