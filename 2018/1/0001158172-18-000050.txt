ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
We are a global information and analytics company that measures consumer audiences and advertising across media platforms. We create our products using a global data platform that combines information about content and advertising consumption on digital (smartphones, tablets and computers), television and movie screens with demographics and other descriptive information. We have developed proprietary data science that enables measurement of person-level and household-level audiences, removing duplicated viewing across devices and over time. This combination of data and methods helps companies across the media ecosystem better understand and monetize their audiences, and develop marketing plans and products to more efficiently and effectively reach those audiences. Our ability to unify behavioral and other descriptive data enables us to provide accredited audience ratings, advertising verification, and granular consumer segments that describe hundreds of millions of consumers. Our customers include buyers and sellers of advertising including digital publishers, television networks, content owners, advertisers, agencies and technology providers.
The platforms we measure include television sets, smartphones, computers, tablets, over-the-top ("OTT") devices and movie theaters, and the information we analyze crosses geographies, types of content and activities, including websites, mobile applications ("apps"), video games, television and movie programming, electronic commerce ("e-commerce") and advertising.
We are a Delaware corporation headquartered in Reston, Virginia with principal offices located at 11950 Democracy Drive, Suite 600, Reston, VA 20190. Our telephone number is 703-438-2000.
Key Developments in 2016-2018
Merger with Rentrak Corporation
On January 29, 2016, comScore completed a merger with Rentrak Corporation (“Rentrak”) with the goal of creating a new cross-platform measurement company capable of offering a more comprehensive and precise set of solutions for measuring media consumption and advertising across platforms. The financial results of Rentrak are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date the merger was completed, January 29, 2016. For further information on the merger with Rentrak, refer to Footnote 3, Business Combinations and Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 10-K. 
Audit Committee Investigation, Subsequent Management Review and Related Matters
As described above in the Explanatory Note and in Item 6, “Selected Financial Data-Background of Audit Committee Investigation and Subsequent Management Review” of this 10-K, we have completed an extensive investigation into matters related to our prior revenue recognition practices, disclosures, internal controls, corporate culture and certain employment practices. As a result, we have adjusted or restated certain previously reported consolidated financial information for 2015 and prior periods. Due to our accounting investigation and review, and our subsequent inability to remain current in our SEC reporting obligations, our common stock ("Common Stock") was suspended from trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) on February 8, 2017, and subsequently delisted. We intend to seek relisting of our Common Stock in connection with becoming current in our SEC reporting obligations. In connection with our announcement of the accounting investigation and review, we also became subject to litigation as discussed in Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” of this 10-K. We also identified various material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as discussed in Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures” of this 10-K.
Leadership Changes to our Management and Board of Directors
Since January 1, 2016, our entire executive leadership team has changed. Our current executive officers are Bill Livek, our President and Executive Vice Chairman, appointed on January 29, 2016; Carol DiBattiste, our General Counsel & Chief Compliance, Privacy and People Officer, appointed on January 23, 2017; Gregory A. Fink, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, appointed on October 17, 2017; Chris Wilson, our Chief Revenue Officer, appointed on June 1, 2017; Dan Hess, our Chief Product Officer, appointed on January 30, 2018; and Joe Rostock, our Chief Information and Technology Operations Officer, appointed on January 30, 2018. In addition, our Board has formed a committee to direct the search for a new Chief Executive Officer and has retained an executive search firm to assist in the search. Also since January 1, 2016, eight of our nine current directors, including our current Board and Audit Committee Chair, have joined our Board. Seven of our nine directors meet the “independence” criteria of the Nasdaq listing standards.

2017 Agreement with Starboard Value LP
In September 2017, we entered into an agreement with Starboard Value LP and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Starboard”), which at the time beneficially owned approximately 4.8% of our Common Stock and had filed a lawsuit in Delaware seeking an order to compel us to hold an annual meeting of stockholders. 
Pursuant to this agreement, among other things, we agreed to appoint to the Board four new independent directors recommended by Starboard, and granted Starboard the right, subject to certain conditions, to appoint up to two additional members of the Board, and Starboard agreed to dismiss the lawsuit it had filed and to vote its shares in favor of all of the Company’s director nominees, and otherwise in accordance with the Board’s recommendations on all other proposals, at the Company's next annual meeting of stockholders. 
Organizational Restructuring
In December 2017, we announced that we were implementing an organizational restructuring to reduce staffing levels by approximately 10% and exit certain geographic regions, in order to enable us to decrease our global costs and more effectively align resources to business priorities. The majority of the employees impacted by the restructuring exited the Company in the fourth quarter of 2017, and the remainder are expected to exit in the first quarter of 2018. In connection with the restructuring, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a charge of $10.5 million related to termination benefits and other costs. We expect to incur an incremental charge in the first quarter of 2018 related to certain employees who exit in 2018.
2018 Convertible Notes Financing
In January 2018, we entered into certain additional agreements with Starboard pursuant to which we (i) issued $150.0 million in new senior secured convertible notes to Starboard in exchange for $85.0 million in cash and $65.0 million in shares of our Common Stock held by Starboard, (ii) granted Starboard the option to acquire up to an additional $50.0 million of such convertible notes, (iii) agreed to grant Starboard warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of Common Stock and (iv) have the right to conduct a rights offering, open to all our stockholders, for up to an additional $150.0 million in such convertible notes, and Starboard agreed to enter into one or more backstop commitment agreements by which it will backstop up to $100.0 million of the convertible notes offered in a rights offering.
Background and Market
We were founded in 1999 on the belief that digital technology would transform the interactions between people, media and brands in ways that would generate substantial demand for data and analytics about that interaction. The growing adoption of digital technologies also allowed measurement of the behavior of consumers' online activities. Based on this vision, we built a global opt-in panel of over two million individuals that provided insight into online activities. In 2002, we acquired Media Metrix, an internet ratings brand with its own panel of consumers. Anticipating that mobile would become a key digital platform in the future, we acquired mobile measurement specialist M:Metrics in 2008. In 2009, we introduced our proprietary Unified Digital Measurement ("UDM") methodology, which allowed us to unite consumer panel data with census-level data from tags that we implemented on websites and their content and, later from software development kits on mobile apps. 
To expand our global presence in Latin America and Europe, respectively, we acquired Certifica in 2009 and NedStat in 2010. To enhance our product offerings, we acquired ARS in 2010 and M.Labs, LLC in 2014. As consumer media consumption and the availability of television and video programming expanded across a myriad of consumer devices, the ability to measure this dynamic cross-platform world became more important for buyers and sellers of advertising. In response, we partnered with ESPN and Arbitron to pioneer a cross-platform measurement solution, and in 2015 launched Xmedia, a syndicated cross-platform measurement product. Arbitron was later acquired by Nielsen Holdings N.V. ("Nielsen"), although we continue to have access to legacy Arbitron data through a 2013 license agreement with Nielsen. This cross-platform measurement strategy led to our 2015 strategic alliance with WPP plc ("WPP"), one of the largest communications services businesses in the world, and the January 2016 merger with Rentrak, a global media measurement and advanced consumer targeting company serving the entertainment, television, video and advertising industries. Following the Rentrak merger, we now have access to millions of television and video on demand ("VOD") screens and the ability to measure box office results from movie screens across the world. As announced in 2016, we have begun to develop our opt-in Total Home Panel, which enables measurement of household devices that use a home’s internet connection, whether traditional mobile and computer devices, streaming media devices, gaming consoles or Internet of Things ("IOT") devices, which may include devices such as smart speakers, thermostats, and appliances.

In addition to the Rentrak merger, we have completed the following significant transactions since January 1, 2015:

• | During the first quarter of 2015, we and WPP entered into a series of agreements whereby WPP became the beneficial owner of 15% of our then outstanding Common Stock and agreed to grant us certain voting rights with respect to its shares of Common Stock; we and WPP formed a strategic alliance for the development and delivery of cross-media audience measurement outside of the U.S.; we purchased WPP’s Nordic Internet Audience Measurement (“IAM”) business; and WPP’s subsidiary, GroupM Worldwide ("GroupM"), entered into a five-year minimum commitment agreement with us ("Subscription Receivable"). Refer to Item 6, "Selected Financial Data," for discussion of adjustments made with respect to the WPP agreements for the year ended December 31, 2015. For additional information, refer to Footnote 3, Business Combinations and Acquisitions and Footnote 17, Related Party Transactions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 


• | In April 2015, we purchased Proximic, Inc., for $9.5 million, to enhance brand safety and content categorization capabilities across our product offerings.


• | In May 2015, we sold certain assets of our mobile operator analytics businesses, in exchange for the assumption of certain customer liabilities.


• | In January 2016, we sold our Digital Analytix business ("DAx") to Adobe Systems Incorporated ("Adobe") for $45.0 million. In addition, in February 2016, we entered into a Strategic Partnership Agreement with Adobe, which was terminated in September 2017. 


• | In April 2016, we purchased certain assets of Compete, Inc. ("Compete") for $27.3 million in cash, net of a working capital adjustment of $1.4 million. Compete was owned by Kantar Millward Brown Company, a subsidiary of WPP. We acquired the Compete assets to expand our presence in certain markets, such as the auto industry and financial services, with improved solution offerings regarding digital performance, including path to purchase, advertising impact analysis and shopping configuration analysis. 

Our Approach to Media Measurement
Our approach to measuring media consumption addresses the ubiquitous nature of media content and the fragmentation caused by the variety of platforms and technologies used to access such content. We believe this fragmentation presents major challenges to using legacy measurement systems that are comprised of relatively small panels of cooperating consumers or limited to specific media platforms. Our products and services are built on measurement and analytic capabilities comprised of broad-based data collection, proprietary databases, internally developed software and a computational infrastructure to measure, analyze and report on digital, television and movie activity at the level of granularity that we believe the media and advertising industries need. We have more than 100 patents covering various aspects of our data collection and data processing systems. 
Data Collection 
The following collection methods illustrate our extensive data sourcing:

• | We collect data from proprietary opt-in consumer panels that measure the use of computers, tablets and smartphones that access the internet. These panelists have agreed to install our passive metering software on their devices, home network or both. 


• | We collect data from our near-census digital network whereby content publishers implement our software code (referred to as "tagging") on their websites, in mobile applications and video players to provide us usage information on an anonymous basis.


• | We license certain demographic and behavioral mobile and panel data from third-party data providers.


• | We obtain U.S. television viewership information from satellite, telecommunications and cable operators covering millions of television and VOD screens.


• | We measure gross receipts and attendance information from movie screens across the world.


• | We anonymously integrate our digital and television viewership information with other third-party datasets that include consumer demographic characteristics, attitudes, lifestyles and purchase behavior.


• | We integrate many of our services with ad serving platforms.


• | We utilize knowledgeable in-house industry analysts that span verticals such as pharmaceuticals, media, finance, consumer packaged goods and political information to add value to our data.


• | We have created an opt-in Total Home Panel which can capture data that run through a home’s internet connection. This expands our intelligence to include such activity as game console and IOT device usage.

Data Science and Management
The ability to integrate, manage and transform massive amounts of data is core to our company. We continue to invest in technologies to enable large-scale measurement with protection of consumer privacy and attractive economics. Our systems contain multiple redundancies and advanced distributed processing technologies. We have created innovations such as:

• | Our UDM methodology, which allows us to combine person-centric panel data with website server data. We believe this gives our customers greater accuracy, granularity and relevance in audience measurement. 


• | An ability to de-duplicate audiences across platforms, which is based on direct observations within our consumer panel and census data combined with proprietary data science. This de-duplication allows us to measure the reach and frequency of advertising and content exposure across platforms and over time. 


• | An ability to validate advertising delivery and detect fraud through our Invalid Traffic and Sophisticated Invalid Traffic filtration methods. These methods have been accredited by the Media Rating Council, which provides our customers with added assurances of validity and reliability.


• | An ability to capture the full content of a website or app session, which allows us to measure activity beyond page views such as purchase transactions, application submissions and product configurations.


• | An ability to intelligently categorize massive amounts of web content, which allows us to inform targeted and brand-safe advertising.

Product Delivery
We deliver our products and services through diverse methods to meet the needs of our customers. These include Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") delivery platforms, application programming interface ("API") and other data feeds that integrate directly with customer systems, and integrations with advertising technology providers such as data management platforms ("DMPs") and demand-side platforms ("DSPs") that enable data management, ad management and programmatic ad trading.

Government Regulation and Privacy 
U.S. and international privacy and data security laws apply to our various businesses. We have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents; however, increasing technology risks or unauthorized users who successfully breach our network security could misappropriate or misuse our proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services. Many countries have more stringent data protection laws than those in the U.S. and this may result in inconsistent requirements and differing interpretations across jurisdictions. Governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. New laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") in Europe and industry self-regulatory codes have been enacted, and more are being considered that will affect our ability (and our customers’ ability) to reach current and prospective customers, to respond to individual customer requests under the laws, and to implement our business models effectively. The GDPR is scheduled to take effect in May 2018 and includes additional requirements regarding the collection and handling of individuals’ personal data. Failure to meet the GDPR requirements, or privacy requirements in other jurisdictions, could result in substantial penalties. comScore participates in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Economic Area and Switzerland to the U.S.

We monitor actions by the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, including regulatory developments affecting Internet Service Providers. Participation in our research panels is voluntary or “opt-in.” We recognize the importance of privacy, and our policies require that participants consent to our privacy and data security practices before our software collects information on the user’s online activity. Where we receive data from third-party service providers, we require such providers to meet privacy and data security standards set forth in our contracts with them, including a requirement to obtain appropriate consent. Our policies and protocols are designed to be consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Inc. ("AICPA") and the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants ("CICA") Trust Service Principles criteria for online privacy.
Employees
As of February 28, 2018, we had approximately 1,830 employees and we believe our employee relations are good. Our employees are not represented by labor unions outside of those few countries where union representation is a mandatory practice for doing business.
