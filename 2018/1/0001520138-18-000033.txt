Additionally, the Company continues to operate CarryOutSupplies.com, a producer and wholesaler of custom printed and generic supplies to the quick service restaurant industry. As is outlined below, the Company is in process of winding down is distribution and market efforts for its legacy tree-free paper business.
 These business operations are covered in detail below:
 Cannabis Hydroponic Growth and Other Cannabis Related Markets
 An area of major focus for the Company is the marketplace for equipment and technologies that support the legal cultivation and processing of cannabis and other agricultural products.
 Early in 2017, Sugarmade signed a distribution agreement with privately-held, Plantation, Corp. becoming the exclusive distributor for the BudLife product line for what Sugarmade believes is the single largest cannabis market in the world – the U.S. states of California, Oregon, and Washington. With legalization of recreational cannabis occurring in California on January 1, 2018, the Company believes there is a significant market opportunity for this revolutionary and patented product line. The BudLife product is currently under development and it is expected Plantation, Corp. will release the product to Sugarmade during the first calendar quarter of 2018. Sugarmade plans to actively market this product line to distributors and retailers throughout the three States territory.
 BudLife utilizes a radical integration of specialized gases and natural agents to create a preservation technology that dramatically extends the useful life of medical marijuana up to six months by actively monitoring the internal container’s environment and automatically adjusting its atmosphere as needed; all without the need for refrigeration. This is a critical capability in the case of marijuana, since unlike fruits and vegetables that thrive in these chilly conditions, refrigeration degrades and undermines the efficacy of the plant’s medical benefits. The technology’s innovative features preserve THC levels, retard terpene degradation and safeguard the other important properties of cannabis, while protecting it from infestation, mold and pathogens to ensure product safety.
 Two core product designs and applications are currently under development:
 BudLife® Intelligent System Lid. – 1 oz. - Initially, replacement intelligent system lids, which preserve and protect the medical marijuana, will be on offer to existing users since the Mason jar is their currently preferred packaging. This represents a huge captive market.
 Source Transport and Storage Containers – 1 lbs - This contains 16 ounces of dried and processed marijuana from cultivator locations for shipment to dispensaries. This is the primary package size, which will be controlled by States’ regulatory regimes. It will be opened and broken down into Consumer Exit Packaging.
 Sugarmade is also engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of several other technologies and products that support the legal cultivation and processing of cannabis and other agricultural products. These include soil containing grow bags used in greenhouses, odor-resistant storage and transport products, lights to enhanced indoor cultivation, and similar products. Sugarmade also operates the www.Caligrownsupplies.com website that offers many of these products to distributors and retailers.
 The Company’s business operations in these areas are expanding as cannabis production within the United States increases and as legalization of cannabis progresses.
 At this time, Sugarmade does not engage in any business operations involving the actual cultivation, processing or sale of any cannabis product.

CarryOutSupplies.com
 Our legacy business operation, CarryOutSupplies.com, is a producer and wholesaler of custom printed and generic supplies and has served more than 3,000 quick service restaurants. Our products include double poly paper cups for cold beverage; disposable, clear, plastic cold cups, paper coffee cups, yogurt cups, ice cream cups, cup lids, cup sleeves, food containers, soup containers, plastic spoons and many other similar products for this market sector. CarryOutSupplies.com was founded in 2009 when the founders gained first-hand experience within the restaurant industry of the difficulty for restaurant owners to acquire custom printed supplies at a reasonable cost. Many quick service restaurants wish to acquire custom printed products, such as those embossed with logos, but the minimum order size for such customization had been cost prohibitive. With that in mind, carry out supplies was founded to provide products to this underserved section of the market. Since that time, the company has become a key supplier to many popular U.S. franchises, particularly in the frozen dessert segments. The company estimates it holds approximately 40% market share of generic and printed products within the take out frozen yogurt and ice cream industries. 
 Sriracha Seasoning Stix and Seasoning Stix
 During September of 2016, Sugarmade became a party to a license with HUY FONG FOODS, INC. (“HFFI”), the maker of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce and has an agreement with HFFI to use its licensed marks for the limited products and purposes permitted by the license. In September of 2017, the agreement was renewed. Based on the agreement and a separate license agreement signed during 2015 with Seasoning Stix International, LLC, the Company has introduced a new culinary seasoning product named Sriracha Seasoning Stix. Sriracha Seasoning Stix are encapsulated Huy Fong Sriracha Sauce and other seasonings in the form of a stick, which are inserted into meat, fish and poultry prior to cooking.  Sugarmade also markets various blends of Seasoning Stix, a product that does not contain Sriracha, via the same agreement with Seasoning Stix International, LLC.
 The manufacturing process for Seasoning Stix utilizes a sophisticated, patented process the combines seasonings and spices into a hard solid shape that can then be inserted directly into meat, fish, poultry and vegetables prior to cooking. Seasoning Stix are a hard solid at room temperature, but as heat is applied the sticks begin to liquefy allowing the meat fibers to act like a sponge absorbing the seasonings and flavors that had previously been encapsulated in the stick.
 The Company contracts with Seasoning Stix International, LLC for the manufacturer of both Sriracha Seasoning Stix and for the Seasoning Stix blends and markets these on www.SrirachaStix.com, in addition to other e-commerce sites and various other websites operated by affiliate marketers. The Company is actively seeking to expand the e-commerce venues where these products can be offered, a process that is well underway. 
 Sugarmade Tree-Free Paper
 We have also been a distributor of paper made from 100% reclaimed sugarcane fiber, enhanced with bamboo. Management of the Company is in the process of ceasing operations for this business line as it has been determined it is no longer a profitable venture for the Company. The Company will continue to market is remaining stock of Sugarmade paper until inventories are exhausted.
