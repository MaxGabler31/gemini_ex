Summary
 
ImmuCell Corporation was founded in 1982 and completed an initial public offering of common stock in 1987. After achieving approval from the Center for Veterinary Biologics, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to sell First Defense® in 1991, we focused most of our efforts during the 1990’s attempting to develop human product applications of the underlying milk protein purification technology. Beginning in 1999, we re-focused our business strategy on the First Defense® product line and other products that improve the health and productivity of dairy and beef cattle. We aim to capitalize on the growth in sales of the First Defense® product line (a product that provides significant immediate immunity to newborn dairy and beef livestock) and to revolutionize the mastitis treatment paradigm (with a product we are developing to treat this most significant cause of economic loss to the dairy industry).
 
During 2000, we began the development of our purified Nisin treatment for subclinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows. No sales of this product can be made without prior approval of our New Animal Drug Application (NADA) by the Center for Veterinary Medicine, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Regulatory achievements to date have significantly reduced the product development risks in the areas of safety and effectiveness. Our primary product development focus has now turned to the manufacturing objectives required for FDA approval.

Since 2006, we have made ongoing efforts to maintain compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations in all of our manufacturing operations, which requires a sustained investment that further enhances the quality of all of our products and our operating efficiency. As we make process improvements, we continue to invest in personnel, equipment and facility modifications to increase the efficiency and quality of our operations.
 
During 2017 and 2016, we issued an aggregate of 2,401,497 shares of common stock, raising gross proceeds of approximately $13.46 million in four separate transactions. In order to minimize the dilutive effects of these transactions on our existing stockholders, we chose not to issue any form of convertible or preferred securities and issued these common shares without any warrants. During 2017 and 2016, we also secured up to approximately $6.8 million in new debt availability. We are using this new capital to complete the development of our purified Nisin product without relying on funding from a partner, thereby retaining control over all product rights and potential revenues.
 
Our operations have been generally profitable, except when we have elected to make unusually large investments in product development expenses for future growth. During the nineteen years in which we have focused on products for the dairy and beef industries, we have funded our operations and improved our net financial position, as demonstrated in the following table (in thousands, except for percentages):

Animal Health Products
 
The First DefenseÒ product line is manufactured from hyperimmune cows’ colostrum (the antibody rich milk that a cow produces immediately after giving birth) utilizing our proprietary vaccine and milk protein purification technologies. The First Defense® product line provides bovine antibodies that newborn calves need but are unable to produce on their own immediately after birth. The target disease, bovine enteritis (calf scours), causes diarrhea and dehydration in newborn calves and often leads to serious sickness and even death. First DefenseÒ is the only USDA-licensed, orally delivered scours preventive product on the market for calves with claims against E. coli K99 and coronavirus (two leading causes of scours). With USDA approval of Tri-Shield™ First DefenseÒ during the fourth quarter of 2017, we can now offer additional protection against rotavirus (a third common scours-causing pathogen). A single dose of our product provides a guaranteed level of protection proven to reduce mortality and morbidity. Our milk antibody products provide Immediate Immunity™ during the first few critical days of life when calves need this protection most. Studies have shown that calves that scour are more susceptible to other diseases later in life and under-perform calves that do not contract scours. The direct, two-part mode-of-action of the First Defense® product line delivers specific immunoglobulins at the gut level to immediately protect against disease, while also providing additional antibodies that are absorbed into the bloodstream. These circulating antibodies function like a natural timed-release mechanism, as they are re-secreted into the gut later to provide extended protection. The First Defense® product line is convenient to use. A calf needs to receive only one dose of First Defense® within the first twelve hours after birth (the earlier the better). The bivalent capsule format of this product is stored at room temperature and no mixing is required before it is given to the calf. The gel tube format of this product does require refrigeration. We are a leader in the scours prevention market with this product. The third quarter of 2017 marked the 26th anniversary of the original USDA approval of this product in 1991. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we sold the 20,000,000th dose of First DefenseÒ. We believe that these milestones demonstrate the value of our technology and the long-term market acceptance of our product.

We believe that the long-term growth in sales of the First DefenseÒ product line may reflect, at least in part, the success of our strategic decision initiated in 2010 to invest in additional sales and marketing efforts to help us introduce the expanding First DefenseÒ product line to new customers. We launched a communications campaign at the end of 2010 that continues to emphasize how the unique ability of First DefenseÒ to provide Immediate Immunity™ generates a dependable and competitive return on investment for dairy and beef producers. Preventing newborn calves from becoming sick helps them to reach their genetic potential and reduces the need to use treatment antibiotics later in life. We are expanding this message by suggesting that producers can go Beyond Vaccination™ to prevent scours with our new product, Tri-Shield™ First DefenseÒ, which achieved USDA approval during the fourth quarter of 2017. This product enables producers to prevent scours at the calf-level without needing a dam-level scours vaccine. By our estimates, in certain cases, when our product replaces all costs associated with dam-level scours vaccination programs, the producer can experience an improved return on investment and more consistent calf protection.
 
We are selling new product applications of First DefenseÒ under the description First Defense TechnologyÒ, which is a unique whey protein concentrate that is processed utilizing our proprietary colostrum (first milk) protein purification methods, for the nutritional and feed supplement markets without the claims of our USDA-licensed product. Through our First Defense TechnologyÒ, we are selling concentrated whey proteins in different formats. During 2011, we initiated sales of First Defense TechnologyÒ in a bulk powder format (no capsule), which is delivered with a scoop and mixed with colostrum for feeding to calves. We are working to achieve USDA claims for this product format during the second half of 2018. During 2011, Milk Products, LLC of Chilton, Wisconsin launched commercial sales of their product, Ultra StartÒ 150 Plus and certain similar private label products, which are colostrum replacers with First Defense TechnologyÒ Inside. During 2012, we initiated a limited launch of a tube delivery format of our First Defense TechnologyÒ in a gel solution. We are working to achieve USDA claims for this product format during the second half of 2018, which will be sold as Dual-Force™ First DefenseÒ.
 
Other competition for resources that dairy producers allocate to their calf enterprises has been increased by the many new products (principally feed supplements) that have been introduced to the calf market. Our sales are normally seasonal, with higher sales expected during the first quarter. Warm and dry weather reduces the producer’s perception of the need for a disease preventative product like the First DefenseÒ product line. However, heat stress on calves caused by extremely hot summer weather can increase the incidence of scours, just as harsher winter weather benefits our sales. Market conditions in the dairy and beef industries, including milk pricing and prices for calves, weakened during 2016 in comparison to 2015. Milk prices made modest improvements in 2017 over the annual averages for 2016 and 2015 but are projected to decline in 2018. Despite the significant market volatility affecting both milk prices and feed costs, we achieved a record level of product sales during the first quarter of 2017, surpassing the previous high level set during the first quarter of 2015, although the production issues discussed later in this report will likely prevent us from equaling that record level of sales during the first quarter of 2018.
 
During the first quarter of 2017, based on an extensive review of the topical wipes product line, we discontinued the product line due to its limited sales growth potential and minimal contribution to profits.
 
During 2001, we began to offer our own, internally developed California Mastitis Test (CMT). CMT is most often used as a quick on-farm diagnostic to determine which quarter of the udder is mastitic. This test can be performed at cow-side for early detection of mastitis. CMT products are also made by other manufacturers and are readily available to the dairy producer.
 
In connection with our acquisition of certain gel formulation technologies during the first quarter of 2016, we also acquired two feed supplement product lines that we now produce and sell under private label relationships with Ridley, USA Inc. of Mankato, MN and Genex Cooperative Inc. of Shawano, WI. These products do not utilize our proprietary antibody technology.

Sales and Markets
 
Our sales and marketing team consists of one vice president, seven regional manager positions and one inside sales and marketing position. The First DefenseÒ product line and CMT are sold primarily through major animal health distributors who, in turn, sell to veterinary clinics, fleet stores and direct to farms. We have experienced minimal bad debt with respect to these products. Sales of the First DefenseÒ product line are normally seasonal with higher sales expected during the first quarter largely driven by the beef calving season, which runs primarily from January to April unlike the dairy industry that tends to calve year round.
 
We estimate that the total market for scours preventative products (including sales of our product) that are given to newborn calves (the calf-level market) is approximately $18 million annually. With the additional claim for our new product ( Tri-Shield™ First DefenseÒ) against rotavirus, we expect to be able to compete against the dam-level vaccine products that are given to the mother cow to increase the antibody level against specific scours-causing pathogens in the colostrum that she produces for her newborn. We estimate that the dam-level product category covers approximately twice as many calves as the calf-level product segment reaches.
 
The majority of our international sales are to Canada. We currently price our products in U.S. dollars. To the extent that the value of the dollar declines with respect to any other currency, our competitive position may be enhanced. Conversely, an increase in the value of the dollar in any country in which we sell products may have the effect of increasing the local price of our products, thereby leading to a potential reduction in demand. Generally, our international sales have been generated through relationships with in-country distributors that have knowledge of the local regulatory and marketing requirements. We are developing a plan to expand the number of countries to which our First DefenseÒ product line is approved for export. Generally, it is our intent to be the holder of these product registrations for each country rather than rely on distribution partners to gain and hold these registrations. This is a long regulatory process but allows us to maximize the use of our product label claims and avoid long-term exclusive distribution agreements. We continue our efforts to grow sales of the First DefenseÒ product line in North America, where there are approximately 41,300,000 dairy and beef cows in the United States and 4,795,000 dairy and beef cows in Canada. We believe that even greater market opportunities exist in other international territories. There are estimated to be approximately 67,500,000 dairy and beef cows in China, 35,885,000 in the European Union, 20,023,000 in Australia and New Zealand, 10,900,000 in Mexico, 1,460,000 in South Korea and 1,340,000 in Japan. However, industry practices, economic conditions, cause of disease, distribution channels and regulatory requirements may differ in these international markets from what we experience in North America.
 
We introduced First DefenseÒ into South Korea in 2005 through Medexx Co., Ltd of Gyeonggi-do, Korea and its equivalent into Japan in 2007 through NYS Co., Ltd of Iwate, Japan. We entered into distribution contracts covering certain Middle Eastern countries with Triplest for Drugs and Trade of Madaba, Jordan during the first quarter of 2017 and covering Iran with Senikco, LLC of Laguna Niguel, CA during the fourth quarter of 2016.
 
With our purified Nisin technology, we are working to expand our product offerings to include an intramammary treatment for subclinical mastitis for the mother cow during lactation. Mastitis (inflammation of the mammary gland) is the most costly and common disease affecting the dairy industry. It is estimated to cost the U.S. dairy industry approximately $2 billion in economic harm per year. The disease diminishes the saleable quantity and overall value of milk, in addition to causing other herd health and productivity losses. While the benefit of treating clinical mastitis is widely known, subclinical mastitis (those cases where cows have infected udders, but still produce saleable milk) is associated with its own significant economic losses and is recognized as a substantial contributor to clinical mastitis cases. There is a growing awareness of the cascade of adverse events and conditions associated with subclinical mastitis for both the dairy producer and the milk processor, including reduced or foregone milk quality premiums, lower milk production (some have estimated approximately 1,500 pounds of lost milk, or about $240 at $16.00 per hundredweight, per infected cow), shorter shelf life for fluid milk, lower yields and less flavor for cheese, higher rates of clinical mastitis, lower conception rates, increased abortions and increased cull rates. Some industry experts have estimated that subclinical mastitis costs the U.S. dairy industry approximately $1 billion per year.

Our active ingredient, Nisin, is an antibacterial peptide that has been demonstrated in animal studies to be an effective aid in the reduction of mastitis-causing organisms in dairy cows. We believe that our product could revolutionize the way that mastitis is treated by making earlier treatment of subclinically infected cows economically feasible by not requiring a milk discard during, or for a period of time after, treatment which would be a significant competitive advantage for our product. No other FDA-approved mastitis treatment product on the market can offer this value proposition. Because the milk from cows treated with traditional antibiotics must be discarded, most dairy producers simply do not treat subclinically infected cows. It is generally current practice to treat mastitis only when the disease has progressed to the clinical stage where the milk from an infected cow cannot be sold. Common milk discard periods cover the duration of treatment and extend from 36 to 96 hours after last treatment, depending on the antibiotic. On average, a cow produces approximately 60 to 80 pounds of milk per day. While milk prices vary significantly, at an average value of $15.00 per 100 pounds, a cow produces approximately $9 to $12 worth of milk per day. These estimated figures would result in milk discard costs ranging from approximately $32 (for 3.5 days of milk at 60 pounds per day) to $132 (for 11 days of milk at 80 pounds per day) per treated animal. We estimate that the approximate cost to the U.S. dairy industry of this discarded milk may be around $300 million per year. The ability to treat such cases without a milk discard could revolutionize the way mastitis is managed in a herd. It is common practice to move sick cows from their regular herd group to a sick cow group for treatment and the related milk discard. This movement causes stress on the cow and a reduction in milk production. Cows treated with our product would not have to be moved, allowing this costly drop in production to be avoided. Our product likely will be priced at a premium to the traditional antibiotic products currently on the market, which are all sold subject to a milk discard requirement. We believe that the product’s value proposition demonstrates a return on investment to the dairy producer and the milk processor that will justify this premium.
 
The USDA’s National Animal Health Monitoring System through its Dairy 2014 study suggests that 21% of all dairy cows are treated with a mastitis drug, of which approximately 51% are treated with third generation cephalosporins. Many fear that the possible overuse of antibiotics in livestock undermines the effectiveness of drugs to combat human illnesses and contributes to a rising number of life-threatening human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria, commonly known as “superbugs”. The FDA is committed to addressing this public health risk. Citing concerns about untreatable, life-threatening infections in humans, new FDA and European regulations are aimed at restricting the use of antibiotics (including cephalosporins) in food animals and at improving milk quality. Regulators have recently increased their monitoring of antibiotic residues in milk and meat. During the first quarter of 2012, the USDA reduced the allowable level of somatic cell counts (SCC) in milk from 750,000 (cells per milliliter) to 400,000 at the individual farm level (not a blended calculation of comingled milk) in order to qualify for an EU health certification for export.
 
The FDA’s Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) became effective January 1, 2017 restricting the use of medically important antibiotics for performance purposes and requiring more oversight of antibiotic usage in food producing animals by a veterinarian, and more changes and restrictions relating to antibiotic usage appear to be likely. Several major food processors and retailers have implemented policies addressing this growing public health concern. By reducing the risk of antibiotic residues and slowing the development of antibiotic-resistant organisms, we can improve food quality and preserve medically important antibiotics for human disease treatment. This would not be a concern for our purified Nisin product because Nisin is not used for human health. This current environment could be favorable to the introduction of our new product as an alternative to traditional antibiotics such as penicillin and cephalosporins. We believe that this changing environment of new regulations and public opinion supports the value of our ongoing Nisin product development and commercialization efforts. Additionally, we believe that the use of our First DefenseÒ product line is consistent with this trend of reducing the use of antibiotics because the prevention of calf scours early in life with our purified colostrum antibodies can reduce the need for treatment antibiotics later in a calf’s life.

It is difficult to estimate the potential size of the market for the treatment of subclinical mastitis because this disease is largely left untreated presently. We believe that approximately 20-30% of the U.S. dairy herd is affected by subclinical mastitis caused by Gram-positive organisms falling within the claim spectrum of our product. This compares to approximately 2% of the U.S. herd that is thought to be infected with clinical mastitis, where approximately $60 million per year is spent on drug treatments. We believe that similar market opportunities also exist outside of the United States and for the treatment of dry (non-lactating) cows. We expect the Nisin production facility that we are constructing for approximately $21 million to have annual production capacity to meet approximately $10 million in sales. Our new facility is designed to have enough room to add a second fermentation and recovery portion of the production line to be purchased and installed at the cost of approximately $7 million to effectively double production output. We would consider making this investment only after commercial acceptance of the product is demonstrated. If annual sales of our mastitis product exceed approximately $20 million, we would evaluate all Nisin supply options, factoring in efficiencies and yield improvements. Building an additional Nisin production facility to meet our needs at that time may be the most cost-effective solution.
 
With a measured approach to expanding our customer-facing staff, it is our objective to double our current level of product sales to approximately $20 million through both continued growth in sales of the First DefenseÒ product line (including our new product, Tri-Shield™ First DefenseÒ) and a successful launch of our novel mastitis treatment as soon as possible. As market penetration for both new products is achieved and additional resources are dedicated to sales, marketing and technical services, our longer-term goal is to reach the $30 million level of product sales as soon as possible during the five-year period after the market launch of our new mastitis product.
 
Product Development
 
The majority of our product development spending is focused on the development of our purified Nisin treatment for subclinical mastitis. During the eighteen-year period that began on January 1, 2000 (the year we began the development) and ended on December 31, 2017, we invested the aggregate of approximately $13,722,000 in the development of this product. This estimated allocation reflects only direct expenditures and includes no allocation of product development or administrative overhead expenses. Approximately $2.9 million of this investment was offset by related product licensing revenues and grant income, most of which was earned from 2001 to 2007.
 
During 2000, we acquired an exclusive license from Nutrition 21, Inc. (formerly Applied Microbiology Inc. or AMBI) to develop and market Nisin-based products for animal health applications, which allowed us to initiate the development of our novel treatment for subclinical mastitis. In 2004, we paid Nutrition 21 approximately $965,000 to buy out this royalty and milestone-based license to Nisin, thereby acquiring control of the animal health applications of Nisin. Nisin, is an antibacterial peptide known to be effective against most Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria. In our pivotal effectiveness study, statistically significant cure rates were associated with a statistically significant reduction in milk somatic cell count, which is an important measure of milk quality. Nisin is a well characterized substance, having been used in food preservation applications for over 50 years. Food-grade Nisin, however, cannot be used in pharmaceutical applications because of its low purity. Our Nisin technology includes processing and purification methods to achieve pharmaceutical-grade purity.
 
In 2004, we entered into a product development and marketing agreement with Pfizer Animal Health (now known as Zoetis) covering this product. That company elected to terminate the agreement in 2007. We believe that this decision was not based on any unanticipated efficacy or regulatory issues. Rather, we believe the decision was primarily driven by a marketing concern relating to their fear that the milk from treated cows could interfere with the manufacture of certain cultured dairy products. Due to the zero milk discard feature, there is a risk that Nisin from the milk of treated cows could interfere with the manufacture of certain (but not all) commercial cultured dairy products, such as some kinds of cheese and yogurt, if a process tank contains a high enough percentage of milk from treated cows. The impact of this potential interference ranges from a delay in the manufacturing process (which does happen at times for other reasons) to the less likely stopping of a cheese starter culture. Milk from cows that have been treated with our product that is sold exclusively for fluid milk products presents no such risk. We worked with scientists and mastitis experts to conduct a formal risk assessment to quantify the impact that milk from treated cows may have on cultured dairy products. This study concluded that the dilution of milk from treated cows through comingling with milk from untreated cows during normal milk hauling and storage practices reduces the risk of interference with commercial dairy cultures to a negligible level when the product is used in accordance with the product label. We do not believe that such a premium-priced product will be used as part of a whole herd (“blitz”) treatment protocol, which reduces the risk of cheese interference. We do not see this as a significant problem as modern “precision dairying” practices support reducing the indiscriminate use of drug treatments.

The New Animal Drug Application (NADA) for our novel mastitis treatment product is comprised of five principal Technical Sections and one administrative submission that are subject to the FDA’s phased review. By statute, each Technical Section submission is generally subject to a six-month review cycle by the FDA. Each Technical Section can be reviewed and approved separately. Upon review and assessment by the FDA that all requirements for a Technical Section have been met, the FDA may issue a Technical Section Complete Letter. The current status of our work on these submissions to the FDA is as follows:
 
1) Environmental Impact: During the third quarter of 2008, we received the Environmental Impact Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA.
 
2) Target Animal Safety: During the second quarter of 2012, we received the Target Animal Safety Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA.
 
3) Effectiveness: During the third quarter of 2012, we received the Effectiveness Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA. The draft product label carries claims for the treatment of subclinical mastitis associated with Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, and coagulase-negative staphylococci in lactating dairy cattle.
 
4) Human Food Safety (HFS): The HFS Technical Section submission was made during the fourth quarter of 2010. This Technical Section includes several subsections such as: a) toxicology, b) total metabolism, c) effects of drug residues in food on human intestinal microbiology, d) effects on bacteria of human health concern (antimicrobial resistance) and e) pivotal residue chemistry. During the second quarter of 2011, we announced that the FDA had accepted the subsections described above and granted a zero milk discard period and a zero meat withhold period during and after treatment for our product. Before we can obtain this Technical Section Complete Letter, we must transfer our analytical method that measures Nisin residues in milk to a government laboratory. This work is complete. We expect to submit the HFS Technical Section to the FDA at the end of the first quarter of 2018. This submission is subject to a six-month review by the FDA. As a result, we anticipate making a public disclosure about the response from the FDA with respect to this submission late in the third quarter of 2018.
 
5) Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC): Obtaining FDA approval of the CMC Technical Section defines the critical path to FDA approval and to initial commercial sales. During the third quarter of 2014, we completed an investment in facility modifications and processing equipment necessary to produce the Drug Substance (the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient, which is our pharmaceutical-grade Nisin) at small-scale. This small-scale facility was used to i) expand our process knowledge and controls, ii) establish operating ranges for critical process parameters, iii) optimize process yields and iv) verify the cost of production. We believe these efforts have reduced the risk associated with our $21 million investment in the commercial-scale production facility.
 
Implementing Nisin production at commercial scale is the most critical action in front of us on our path to regulatory approval. We previously entered into an agreement with a multi-national pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturer for our commercial-scale supplies of Nisin. However, we determined in 2014 that that agreement did not offer us the most advantageous supply arrangement in terms of either cost or long-term dependability. We presented this product development opportunity to a variety of large and small animal health companies. While such a corporate partnership could have provided access to a much larger sales and marketing team and allowed us to avoid the large investment in a commercial-scale production facility, the partner would have taken a large share of the gross margin from all future product sales of our Nisin product. We are encouraged by the regulatory and marketing feedback that we received from prospective partners, following their due diligence, that our novel mastitis treatment can achieve FDA approval and have a significant, positive impact on the dairy industry.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we acquired land nearby to our existing Portland facility for the construction of a new manufacturing facility that would enable us to generate our own Nisin supply at commercial scale.  During the third quarter of 2016, we commenced construction of this facility.  Construction of the facility was completed during the fourth quarter of 2017.  As anticipated, we began equipment installation during the third quarter of 2017 and expect installation and qualification to be complete during early 2018.  Three registration batches must be produced at commercial scale, a detailed CMC Technical Section must be completed and submitted to the FDA and successful FDA inspection(s) must be achieved.  We anticipate making the first phased Nisin Drug Substance CMC Technical Section submission to the FDA during the middle of 2018.  A second phased submission, which includes responses to the first phased review and detailed information on the sterile Nisin Drug Product, would be filed in the first half of 2019.  Each submission is subject to a six month review by the FDA. After approval of the CMC section, there is a 60-day administrative review before product license approval can be issued.  We expect to achieve earlier approval of the HFS Technical Section.  Our timeline supports obtaining FDA approval for the Nisin product by late 2019 to early 2020, subject to specific FDA review and requests.  With respect to CMC Technical Section, we intend to disclose the timing of the phased submissions to the FDA and the timing of the responses from the FDA and any revisions to the timeline, as we go forward.

We are party to a long-term, exclusive supply agreement with Plas-Pak Industries, Inc. (now owned by Nordson Corporation) of Norwich, Connecticut covering the proprietary syringe that was developed specifically for treating cows with our mastitis product. These syringes were used for all pivotal studies. During the third quarter of 2017, this agreement was extended to January 1, 2024.
 
Since 2010, we have been party to a long-term, exclusive Contract Manufacture Agreement with Norbrook Laboratories Limited of Newry, Northern Ireland, an FDA-approved Drug Product (aseptic filled and packaged syringes) manufacturer, covering the formulation and aseptic filling and final packaging of the Nisin Drug Product. Norbrook provided these services for clinical material used in all pivotal studies. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into a revised agreement with Norbrook to support the final development and commercial-scale production of our mastitis product after FDA approval. If we do not achieve FDA approval of the Nisin product by the end of 2019, we would be liable for a $100,000 termination fee under this agreement. We are presently negotiating certain contract modifications and extensions with Norbrook.
 
Our second most important product development program (in terms of dollars invested and, we believe, potential market impact) has been an effort to prevent scours in calves caused by rotavirus. In connection with that effort, during the second quarter of 2009 we entered into an exclusive license with the Baylor College of Medicine covering the underlying rotavirus vaccine technology used to generate the specific antibodies for use with animals. This perpetual license (if not terminated for cause) is subject to ongoing royalty payments. Results from pilot studies completed during the first quarter of 2009 justified continued product development. We initiated a second pivotal effectiveness study at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine during the second quarter of 2014 and announced positive effectiveness results from this pivotal study during the first quarter of 2015. During the third quarter of 2015, we obtained concurrence from the USDA that we have been granted disease claims against rotavirus for our product. We achieved product license approval and initiated market launch of this product, Tri-Shield™ First DefenseÒ, during the fourth quarter of 2017. This is the first calf-level, passive antibody product on the market with USDA-approved disease claims providing immediate immunity against each of the three leading causes of calf scours (E. coli, coronavirus and rotavirus). The new product combines the E. coli and coronavirus antibodies contained in our legacy product with a guaranteed minimum level of rotavirus antibody content in one preventative dose. This unique breadth of claims further differentiates our product from competitive products on the market that contain only one or two of these label claims. This new product is now available in a gel tube delivery format. Because it is possible that all farms may not have a prevalent rotavirus problem, we are continuing to sell the bivalent formats of First DefenseÒ as options for customers. Historically, the primary tool to help combat scours has been to vaccinate the cow with a dam-level scours vaccine. With this expanded claim set, we can compete more effectively against these dam-level vaccine products that are given to the mother cow to increase the antibody level against specific scours-causing pathogens in the colostrum that she produces for her newborn. It is generally believed that only 80% of animals respond to a vaccine, which could leave about 20% of calves unprotected. Additionally, our research suggests that treatment protocols for dam-level scours vaccine programs are not always followed, leaving even more calves compromised. Our new marketing campaign, ‘Beyond Vaccination™’, suggests that by delivering immediate immunity directly to the calf via Tri-Shield™ First DefenseÒ, producers can reduce stress-causing injections to the cow and save the associated labor for vaccines that are more critical to cow health. Reliance on a dam-level scours vaccine requires that money be spent before it is known whether the cow is carrying a viable, valued calf. With Tri-Shield™ First Defense®, every calf is equally protected and that investment can be targeted to the calves that are most critical to the operation. This, in turn, can free up space in the cow’s vaccination schedule to optimize her immune response to vaccines that are critical to her health. This variability of a cow’s immune response to vaccines that creates a sales opportunity for our new product also causes a production challenge that can impact our costs of goods sold when we immunize our source cows to produce the antibodies used in our production process.

The balance of our product development efforts have been primarily focused on other improvements, extensions or additions to our First DefenseÒ product line. We are currently working to establish USDA claims for our bivalent gel tube and bulk powder (both expected during the second half of 2018) formulations of First Defense TechnologyÒ, which will then be re-branded Dual-Force™ First DefenseÒ. We are also investing in additional studies comparing First DefenseÒ to the competition. At the same time, we are working to expand our product development pipeline of bacteriocins that can be used as alternatives to traditional antibiotics. During the second quarter of 2015, we entered into an exclusive option agreement to license new bacteriocin technology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we extended this exclusive option agreement through March 2019. This technology focuses on bacteriocins having activity against Gram-negative infections for use in combating mastitis in dairy cattle. Subject to the availability of needed financial and other resources, we intend to begin new development projects that are aligned with our core competencies and market focus. We also remain interested in acquiring, on suitable terms, other new products and technologies that fit with our sales focus on the dairy and beef industries.
 
Competition
 
Our competition in the animal health market includes other biotechnology companies and major animal health companies. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and human resources and more extensive product development capabilities than we do.
 
We would consider any company that sells an antibiotic to treat mastitis, such as Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck Animal Health and Zoetis (formerly Pfizer Animal Health, a division of Pfizer, Inc.), to be among the potential competitors for our mastitis product. We expect the FDA to grant a period of five years of market exclusivity for our product (meaning the FDA would not grant approval to a second NADA with the same active drug for a period of five years after the first NADA approval is granted) under Section 512(c)(2)F of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
 
There are several other products on the market (some with claims and some without) that are delivered to newborn calves to prevent scours. We believe that the First DefenseÒ product line offers two significant competitive advantages. First, only the First DefenseÒ product line provides protection against E. coli, coronavirus and rotavirus, three of the leading causes of calf scours. Second, being derived from colostrum, our product offers Immediate ImmunityTM through antibodies that function both at the gut level and are absorbed into the blood stream for future protection. All formats of our product can be administered without delaying maternal colostrum.
 
Zoetis sells a product that competes directly with the First DefenseÒ product line in preventing scours via oral delivery to newborn calves. Their product (Calf-Guard®) is a modified-live virus vaccine. Newborn calves respond poorly to vaccines and the immune system must be given time to develop a response to vaccines. Both our product and Calf-Guard® carry claims against coronavirus and rotavirus infections, but this competitive product does not carry a claim against E. coli infections like our product does. It is common practice to delay colostrum feeding when dosing a calf with Calf-Guard® so that the antibodies in the colostrum do not inactivate the vaccine product. There is no nutritional benefit to withholding milk from newborn calves. In contrast, we encourage the feeding of four quarts of high quality colostrum immediately after birth when dosing a calf with our product, which is standard practice for good calf health. Because the antibodies in our product would likely work to inactivate a modified-live vaccine, rendering it useless or less useful, our product label historically included a precaution that First DefenseÒ should not be used within five days of such a vaccine. During the first quarter of 2015, the USDA granted us permission to remove this precaution from our label, and we have done so. We believe that this precaution should be required on the Calf-Guard® label to prevent inactivation of that product by First DefenseÒ antibodies or colostrum. Our product is priced at a premium to Calf-Guard®.
 
Elanco Animal Health (a division of Eli Lilly and Company) and Boehringer Ingelheim also sell directly competitive products. The Elanco product (Bovine EcolizerÒ and Bovine EcolizerÒ + C20) was acquired through Elanco’s January 2015 acquisition of Novartis Animal Health and carries claims to prevent scours in newborn calves caused by E. coli and C. perfringens. The Boehringer product (Bar-Guard-99™) carries claims to prevent scours in newborn calves caused by E. coli. These two products are both derived from horse blood rather than the bovine colostrum used for the First DefenseÒ product line. Equine antibodies are less efficiently absorbed into the bovine bloodstream, so fewer antibodies are re-secreted for additional protection.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, Merck launched a new competitive product into this market space. This product (BOVILIS® Coronavirus) is a modified-live virus intranasal vaccine that carries a claim against coronavirus only.
 
When compared to the other UDSA-approved calf-level scour preventatives, we believe we are first in sales dollars and second in volume. This product category is comprised of five (increasing from four until the fourth quarter of 2016) primary brands that are given either orally or intranasal to newborn dairy and beef calves immediately after birth. Market research that we subscribe to suggests that during 2017 our product comprised approximately 33% of the total doses sold in this product category (one dose equates to one calf, according to label administration on all products). This estimate is down from 36% during 2016 and 40% during 2015 when the product category included only 4 primary brands (one of which experienced lack of supply to the market during late 2014 and into the middle of 2015). This market share estimate is slightly up from 32% in 2014 and up from 26% and 22% in 2013 and 2012, respectively, as the total product category has steadily increased. These estimates do not include sales of vaccine products that are given to the dam (mother cow), which is discussed below.
 
With the new rotavirus claim for our product (Tri-Shield™ First Defense®) we are now competing against dam-level vaccine products that are given to the mother cow to increase the antibody level against scours-causing pathogens in the colostrum that she produces for her newborn. Those products are sold by Elanco (Scour Bos™), Merck (GuardianÒ) and Zoetis (ScourGuardÒ). Despite the best-managed dam vaccine program, colostrum quality is naturally variable and newborn calves do not always get the antibodies they need from maternal colostrum. We believe that the guaranteed dose of antibodies in our product provides more consistent protection than such vaccine products.
 
We may not be aware of competition that we face, or may face in the future, from other companies. Our competitive position will be highly influenced by our ability to attract and retain key scientific, managerial and sales personnel, to develop proprietary technologies and products, to obtain USDA, FDA or foreign approvals for new products, to effectively promote and market our products, to have available properly licensed, efficient and effective raw material and finished product manufacturing resources and to continue to profitably sell our current products. We currently compete on the basis of product performance, price and distribution capability. We continue to monitor our network of independent distributors to maintain our competitive position.
 
Patents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks
 
We own patents, copyrights and trade secrets as well as substantial know-how and technology (collectively “technology”). This technology generally relates to our research, products and processes for product production. U.S. Patent No. 6,794,181 entitled “Method of Purifying Lantibiotics” was issued in 2004, which covers our manufacturing process for preparing pharmaceutical-grade Nisin. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we filed a U.S. patent application covering key, novel aspects of our manufacturing process for preparing pharmaceutical-grade Nisin. In the future, we may file additional patent applications for certain products under development. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued with respect to any pending or future applications. In some cases, we have chosen (and may choose in the future) not to seek patent protection for certain products or processes. In those instances, we have sought (and may seek in the future) to maintain the confidentiality of any relevant proprietary technology through operational measures and contractual agreements.
 
We own numerous trademarks and trade dress that are very important to our business.  We have several pending trademark and trade dress applications and registrations in the United States and Canada.  We own the following U.S. trademark registrations for the trademarks we use in connection with our proprietary products and services: IMMUCELL, FIRST DEFENSE, FIRST DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY, TRI-SHIELD FIRST DEFENSE, TRI-SHIELD FIRST DEFENSE (& Design), DUAL-FORCE FIRST DEFENSE, YOUR CALF CREW and MAST OUT.  We own the following U.S. trademark applications for the trademarks and trade dress that we use in connection with our proprietary products and services: BEYOND VACCINATION, BEYOND VACCINATION (& Design), Blue Bolus Trade Dress, Blue Gel Trade Dress and FD FIRST DEFENSE (& Design).  The United States Patent and Trademark Office issued a determination that our IMMEDIATE IMMUNITY trademark, which we use in connection with marketing of all of our products, is generic.  Rather than appeal this finding, we are continuing to build our common law rights in the brand.  The FDA issued a determination that the name, MAST OUT, which we had intended to use for our purified Nisin product, is overly promotional. Rather than continuing an appeal of this decision, we have decided to select a new product name before market launch of the purified Nisin product. During the first quarter of 2017, we sold our registered WIPE OUT trademarks and THE ONE STEP COW PREP related to dairy wipes when we discontinued that product line.

Government Regulation
 
We believe that we are in compliance with current regulatory requirements relating to our business and products. The manufacture and sale of animal health biologicals within the United States is generally regulated by the USDA (Center for Veterinary Biologics). We have received USDA and Canadian Food Inspection Agency approval for the bolus format of First DefenseÒ and USDA approval for the gel tube format of Tri-Shield™ First Defense®. Our purified Nisin product is regulated by the FDA, Center for Veterinary Medicine, which regulates veterinary drugs. Regulations in the European Union will likely require that our product be sold subject to a milk discard requirement in that territory, although the duration of the milk discard requirement may be shorter than the discard requirement applicable to competitive antibiotic products in that market. Comparable agencies exist in foreign countries, and foreign sales of our products will be subject to regulation by such agencies. Many countries have laws regulating the production, sale, distribution or use of biological products, and we may have to obtain approvals from regulatory authorities in countries in which we propose to sell our products. Depending upon the product and its applications, obtaining regulatory approvals may be a relatively brief and inexpensive procedure or it may involve extensive clinical tests, incurring significant expenses and an approval process of several years’ duration. We generally rely on in-country experts to assist us with or to perform international regulatory applications.
Employees
 
We currently employ 47 employees (including 5 part-time employees). Approximately 25.5 full-time equivalent employees are engaged in manufacturing operations, 7.5 full-time equivalent employees in sales and marketing, 7 full-time equivalent employees in product development activities and 4.5 full-time equivalent employees in finance and administration. At times, manufacturing personnel are also utilized, as needed, in the production of clinical material for use in product development. All of our employees are required to execute non-disclosure, non-compete and invention assignment agreements intended to protect our rights in our proprietary products. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and consider our employee relations to be excellent.
Public Information
 
As a reporting company, we file quarterly and annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. We also file current reports on Form 8-K, whenever events warrant or require such a filing. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information about us that we file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.
