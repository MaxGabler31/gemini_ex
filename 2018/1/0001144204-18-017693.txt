CUSTOMERS
 
The Company’s five largest customers represented 36.8% of the Company’s total sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. The following table sets forth information regarding the Company’s five largest customers.

 | Percentage of Total | 
------------------------------+---------------------+-----
Name of Major Customers | Revenue in 2017 | 
Fiat Chrysler North America | | 14.3 | %
Beiqi Foton | | 6.3 | %
Dongfeng Auto Group Co., Ltd. | | 6.1 | %
SAIC Motor | | 5.1 | %
Zhejiang Geely Holding Group | | 5.0 | %
Total | | 36.8 | %

 
The Company primarily sells its products to the above-mentioned original equipment manufacturing, “OEM”, customers; it also has excellent relationships with them, including serving as their first-rank supplier and developer for product development for new models. While the Company intends to continue to focus on retaining and winning this business, it cannot ensure that it will succeed in doing so. It is difficult to keep doing business with the above-mentioned OEM customers as a result of severe price competition and customers’ diversification of their supply base. The Company’s business would be materially and adversely affected if it loses one or more of these major customers.
 
SALES AND MARKETING
 
The Company’s sales and marketing team has 121 sales persons, which are divided into an OEM team, a sales service team and a working group dedicated to international business. These sales and marketing teams provide a constant interface with the Company’s key customers. They are located in all major vehicle producing regions to represent more effectively the Company’s customers’ interests within the Company’s organization, to promote their programs and to coordinate their strategies with the goal of enhancing overall service and satisfaction. The Company’s ability to support its customers is further enhanced by its broad presence in terms of sales offices, manufacturing facilities, engineering technology centers and joint ventures.
 
The Company’s sales and marketing organization and activities are designed to create overall awareness and consideration of, and therefore to increase sales of the Company’s modular systems and components. To achieve that objective, the Company organized delegations to visit the United States, Korea, India and Japan and has supplied power steering gear to Fiat Chrysler North America. Through these activities, the Company has generated potential business interest as a strong base for future development.

DISTRIBUTION
 
The Company’s distribution system covers all of China. The Company has established sales and service offices with certain significant customers to deal with matters related to such customers in a timely fashion. The Company also established distribution warehouses close to major customers to ensure timely deliveries. The Company maintains strict control over inventories. Each of these sales and service offices sends back to the Company through e-mail or fax information related to the inventory and customers’ needs. The Company guarantees product delivery in 8 hours for those customers who are located within 200 km from the Company’s distribution warehouses, and 24 hours for customers who are located outside of 200 km from the Company’s distribution warehouses. Delivery time is a very important competitive factor in terms of customer decision making, together with quality, pricing and long-term relationships.
EMPLOYEES AND FACILITIES
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Company employed approximately 5,319 persons, including approximately: 
 

· | 2,081 by Henglong (including Testing Center formed by Henglong) ;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------
· | 913 by Jiulong; 
· | 353 by Shenyang; 
· | 32 by USAI; 
· | 178 by Wuhu; 
· | 228 by Jielong; 
· | 52 by Wuhan Chuguanjie; 
· | 1,239 by Hubei Henglong; 
· | 17 by HLUSA; 
· | 150 by Chongqing Henglong; 
· | 27 by Brazil Henglong; and 
· | 49 by Shanghai Henglong. 

 
As of December 31, 2017, Henglong, Jiulong, Shenyang, Chongqing, Wuhan Chuguanjie, Hubei Henglong and Wuhu had a manufacturing and administration area of 111,211 square meters, 39,478 square meters, 35,354 square meters, 57,849 square meters, 53,675 square meters, 177,747 square meters and 83,705 square meters, respectively.
 
Hubei Province, which is home to Dongfeng, one of the largest automakers in China, provides an ample supply of inexpensive but skilled labor to automotive-related industries. The annual production of one of the Company’s main products, power steering gears, was approximately 6.1 million units and 5.6 million units in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Although the production process continues to rely heavily on manual labor, the Company has invested substantially in high-level production machinery to improve capacity and production quality. Approximately $108.4 million was spent over the last three years to purchase professional-grade equipment and extend workshops.
 
RAW MATERIALS
 
The Company purchases various manufactured components and raw materials for use in its manufacturing processes. The principal components and raw materials the Company purchases include castings, finished sub-components, aluminum, steel, fabricated metal electronic parts and molded plastic parts. The most important raw material is steel. The Company enters into purchase agreements with local suppliers. The annual purchase plans are determined at the beginning of the calendar year but are subject to revision every three months as a result of customers’ orders. A purchase order is made according to monthly production plans. This protects the Company from building up inventory when the orders from customers change.

-------------

 

The Company’s purchases from its ten largest suppliers represented in the aggregate 20.3% of all components and raw materials it purchased for the year ended December 31, 2017, and none of them provided more than 10% of total purchases.
 
All components and raw materials are available from numerous sources. The Company has not, in recent years, experienced any significant shortages of manufactured components or raw materials and normally does not carry inventories of these items in excess of what is reasonably required to meet its production and shipping schedules.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
The Company owns the Testing Center, a Hubei Provincial-Level technical center, which has been approved by the Hubei Economic Commission. The center has a staff of about 318, including 40 senior engineers and 89 engineers, primarily focusing on steering system R&D, tests, production process improvement and new material and production methodology application.
 
In addition, the Company has formed Shanghai Henglong to engage in the design and sale of automotive electronics, including key parts of EPS.
 
The Company believes that its engineering and technical expertise, together with its emphasis on continuing research and development, allow it to use the latest technologies, materials and processes to solve problems for its customers and to bring new, innovative products to market. The Company believes that continued research and development activities, including engineering, are critical to maintaining its pipeline of technologically advanced products. The Company has aggressively managed costs in other portions of its business in order to increase its total expenditures for research and development activities, including engineering, at approximately $33.5 million and $27.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2017 and 2016, the sales of such newly developed products accounted for about 22.0% and 18.1%, respectively, of total sales.
 
COMPETITION
 
The automotive components industry is extremely competitive. The Company’s customers consider criteria including quality, price/cost competitiveness, system and product performance, reliability and timeliness of delivery, new product and technology development capability, excellence and flexibility in operations, degree of global and local presence, effectiveness of customer service and overall management capability. The power steering system market is fragmented in China, and the Company has seven major competitors. Of these competitors, two are Sino-foreign joint ventures while the other five are state-owned. Like many competitive industries, there is pressure on downward selling prices.

--------------

 

The Company’s major competitors, including Shanghai ZF, Nexteer and First Auto FKS, “FKS,” are component suppliers to specific automobile manufacturers. Shanghai ZF is the joint venture of SAIC and ZF Germany, which is an exclusive supplier to SAIC-Volkswagen and SAIC-GM. FKS is a joint venture between First Auto Group and Japan’s Koyo Company and its main customer is FAW-Volkswagen Company.
 
While the Chinese government limits foreign ownership of auto assemblers to 50%, there is no analogous limitation in the automotive components industry. Thus, opportunities exist for foreign component suppliers to set up factories in China. These overseas competitors employ technology that may be more advanced and may have existing relationships with global automobile assemblers, but they are generally not as competitive as the Company in China in terms of production cost and flexibility in meeting client requirements.
 
CHINESE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY
 
The Company is a supplier of automotive parts and most of its operations are located in China. An increase or decrease in the output and sales of Chinese vehicles could result in an increase or decrease of the Company’s results of operations. According to the latest statistics from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, “CAAM”, the output and sales volume of passenger vehicles in 2017 was 24.8 million and 24.7 million units, respectively, an increase of 1.6% and 1.4% compared to 2016. The output and sales volume of commercial vehicles in 2017 was 4.2 million and 4.2 million units, respectively, an increase of 13.8% and 14.0% compared to 2016. In 2017, the Company’s sales of steering gears for passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles increased by 6.2% and 15.4%, respectively, compared to 2016.
 
CAAM expects that sales volume of vehicles in China will grow by 3% in 2018.
  
ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
 
The Company is subject to the requirements of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S., including China’s, environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations. These include laws regulating air emissions, water discharge and waste management. The Company has an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support its compliance with these requirements globally. Although the Company intends to comply with all such requirements and regulations, it cannot provide assurance that it is at all times in compliance. The Company has made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental requirements, although such expenditures were not material during the past two years. Environmental requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that its eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not be material.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not make any material capital expenditures relating to environmental compliance.
