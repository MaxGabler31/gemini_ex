ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
Overview 
 Veeva is a leading provider of industry cloud solutions for the global life sciences industry. We were founded in 2007 on the premise that industry-specific cloud solutions could best address the operating challenges and regulatory requirements of life sciences companies. Our products are designed to meet the unique needs of our customers and their most strategic business functions—from research and development (R&D) to commercialization. Our products address a broad range of needs—including multichannel customer relationship management (CRM), content management, master data management, and data regarding healthcare professionals and organizations—and are designed to help life sciences companies bring products to market faster and more efficiently, market and sell more effectively, and maintain compliance with government regulations. 
 Customer success is one of our core values, and our focus on it has allowed us to deepen and expand our strategic relationships with customers over time. Because of our industry focus, we have a unique, in-depth perspective into the needs and best practices of life sciences companies. This allows us to develop targeted solutions, quickly adapt to regulatory changes, and incorporate highly relevant enhancements into our existing solutions at a rapid pace.
Our goal is to become the most strategic technology partner to the life sciences industry and achieve long-term leadership with our solutions that support the R&D and commercial functions of life sciences companies. Our commercial solutions help life sciences companies achieve better, more intelligent engagement with healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations across multiple communication channels, including face-to-face, email, and web. Our R&D solutions for the clinical, regulatory, quality, and, when available, safety functions help life sciences companies streamline their end-to-end product development processes to increase operational efficiency and maintain regulatory compliance throughout the product lifecycle.
We are now also bringing the benefits of our content management solutions to a new set of customers in process and discrete manufacturing, consumer packaged goods, and highly regulated services industries. We believe that the ability of our solutions to meet the demanding business and compliance requirements of life sciences companies translates well into many other highly regulated industries. Our application currently offered to companies outside of life sciences is designed to help customers efficiently manage critical regulated processes and content in a compliant way and to enable secure collaboration across internal and external stakeholders, including outsourcing partners and vendors.
 Executing in the Veeva Way
 Fundamental to our business model is what we call The Veeva Way. The Veeva Way is key to our disciplined approach to achieve our goal of long-term leadership in each of the product markets we serve.
 We start with a focus on addressing clear and correct target markets. Those are large product markets in which the problem being addressed by our solution is strategic to the businesses of our customers and in which we believe Veeva can become the leader over the long-term if we execute well. We embrace the concept of running to complexity, an approach in which we strive to solve the most important and challenging information technology problems our customers face. 
 We focus on delivering product excellence and cloud innovation. Our product development process begins with assembling and investing in strong product teams focused on building deep, best-in-class applications in every product market we serve. Through innovative cloud technology, we also aim to eliminate disparate systems by delivering unified application suites that work together on a common platform.

We strive to forge strong relationships with our customers and focus on customer success. When we enter a new product market, we begin with a small number of early adopter customers. We focus on learning from these early adopters and ensuring that they are successful with our products. Once successful, our early adopters have developed into vocal advocates, enabling our reference selling model.   
 Finally, our goal is to drive strong growth and profitability through highly efficient, targeted sales and marketing, disciplined product planning, and profitable professional services. Our strong growth and profitability has allowed us to make ongoing investments for continued product innovation in our existing markets, and we believe provides us with the resources to continue to invest in new market opportunities.

 Our Customers 
 As of January 31, 2018, we served 625 customers. For an explanation of how we define current customers, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Components of Results of Operations.” We deliver solutions to companies throughout the life sciences industry, including pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical product companies, contract sales organizations, and contract research organizations. Our customers range from the largest global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as Bayer AG, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Eli Lilly and Company, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., and Novartis International AG, to smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Alkermes plc, Grupo Ferrer Internacional S.A., Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and LEO Pharma A/S. For our fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018, we did not have any single customer that represented more than 10% of our total revenues. For a summary of our financial information by geographic location, see note 13 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
Our Employees 
 We believe we provide employees a unique opportunity to develop and sell world-class, cloud-based applications and platforms within a specific industry. Historically, software developers had to choose between developing platforms for a broad but generic set of customers and building industry-specific solutions with limited further applicability. Our industry cloud approach empowers developers to build important applications and platforms that can become the standard in our industry while enabling sales personnel to sell a growing portfolio of applications. We believe that this unique opportunity allows us to continue to attract top talent for our product development and sales efforts. 
 As of January 31, 2018, we employed 2,171 people. We also engage temporary employees and consultants. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good. 
 Technology Infrastructure and Operations 
 Our solutions utilize a pod-based architecture in multiple regions that allow for scalability, operational simplicity and security. Our products are hosted in data centers located in the United States, the European Union, and Japan. We utilize third-parties to provide our computing infrastructure and manage the infrastructure on which our solutions operate. For example, for Veeva CRM and certain of our multichannel CRM applications, we utilize the hosting infrastructure provided by salesforce.com. For our Veeva Vault applications, Veeva Network applications, and certain other Veeva Commercial Cloud applications, we utilize Amazon Web Services.
 Veeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K   7


Our infrastructure providers employ advanced measures to ensure physical integrity and security, including redundant power and cooling systems, fire and flood prevention mechanisms, continual security coverage, biometric readers at entry points and anonymous exteriors. We also implement various disaster recovery measures such that data loss would be minimized in the event of a single data center disaster. We architect our solutions using redundant configurations to minimize service interruptions. We continually monitor our solutions for any sign of failure or pending failure, and we take preemptive action to attempt to minimize or prevent downtime.
 Our technology is based on multitenant architectures that apply common, consistent management practices for all customers using our solutions. We enable multiple customers to share the same version of our solutions while securely partitioning their respective data. Portions of our multichannel customer relationship management applications are built on the Salesforce1 Platform. Veeva Vault, Veeva Network, and portions of our other Commercial Cloud applications are built upon our own proprietary platforms.
 Sales and Marketing 
 We sell our solutions through our direct sales organization. In large life sciences companies, the R&D and commercial business functions commonly have separate technology and business decision makers. Accordingly, we market and sell our solutions to align with the distinct characteristics of those decision makers. We have distinct R&D and commercial sales teams, which we further segment to focus on selling to large global life sciences companies and smaller life sciences companies. We also have a distinct sales team for our sales efforts to companies in regulated industries outside of life sciences. 
 Our Relationship with salesforce.com 
 Veeva CRM and certain of our related multichannel CRM applications are developed on or utilize the Salesforce1 Platform of salesforce.com, inc. We are salesforce.com’s preferred and recommended Salesforce1 Platform application provider of sales automation solutions for drug makers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, or the pharma/biotech industry. Our agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions and specified remedies for breach, salesforce.com will not position, develop, promote, invest in or acquire applications directly competitive to the Veeva CRM application for sales automation that directly target the pharma/biotech industry. Our agreement with salesforce.com does not restrict a salesforce.com customer’s ability (or the ability of salesforce.com on behalf of a specific salesforce.com customer) to customize or configure the Salesforce1 Platform. However, our agreement restricts salesforce.com from competing with us with respect to sales opportunities for sales automation solutions for the pharma/biotech industry unless such competition has been pre-approved by salesforce.com’s senior management based on certain criteria specified in the agreement. Our agreement also imposes certain limits on salesforce.com entering into arrangements similar to ours with other parties with respect to sales automation applications for the pharma/biotech industry. Our remedy for a breach of these commitments by salesforce.com would be to terminate the agreement, or continue the agreement but be released from our minimum order commitments described below from the date of salesforce.com’s breach forward. Our agreement allows us to provide our customers with rights to the Salesforce1 Platform Unlimited Edition for use as combined with the proprietary aspects of certain of our multichannel CRM applications, and subject to salesforce.com’s standard prior review and approval processes, to build additional applications on the Salesforce1 Platform. 
 8 Veeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K


Under our agreement, salesforce.com provides the hosting infrastructure and data center for portions of our multichannel CRM applications, as well as the system administration, configuration, reporting and other platform level functionality. In exchange, we pay salesforce.com a fee. Our current agreement with salesforce.com expires on September 1, 2025 and is renewable for five-year periods upon mutual agreement. We are obligated to meet minimum order commitments of $500 million over the term of the agreement, including “true-up” payments if the orders we place with salesforce.com have not equaled or exceeded the following aggregate amounts within the timeframes indicated: (i) $250 million from March 1, 2014 to September 1, 2020 and (ii) the full amount of $500 million by September 1, 2025. See note 11 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information about our on-going minimum fee obligation to salesforce.com. If either party elects not to renew the agreement or if the agreement is terminated by us as a result of salesforce.com’s breach, the agreement provides for a five-year wind-down period in which we would be able to continue providing the Salesforce1 Platform as combined with the proprietary aspects of our solutions to our existing customers but would be limited with respect to the number of additional subscriptions we could sell to our existing customers. We believe that we have a mutually beneficial strategic relationship with salesforce.com. 
Quality and Compliance 
 Our customers use our solutions for business activities that are subject to a complex regime of country- and region-specific healthcare laws and regulations across the globe. In order to best serve our customers, we must ensure that the data processed by our systems are accurate and secure and that they retain the level of confidentiality and privacy commensurate with the type of information managed. To comply with IT healthcare regulations and security and privacy regulations generally, industry-specific capabilities must be designed for and embedded in our solutions. 
Quality and Compliance Program
 To comply with IT healthcare regulations, certain capabilities such as robust audit trail tracking, compliant electronic signature capture, data encryption, and secure access controls must be designed for and embedded in our solutions. In addition to design requirements, our solutions must be thoroughly tested to comply with the regulations that apply to electronic record keeping systems for the life sciences industry, which include: 

Regulation | Regulation Description 
---------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21 CFR 820.75 | U.S. FDA device regulation on system validation 
21 CFR 211.68 | U.S. FDA pharma GMP regulation on system validation 
21 CFR 11 | U.S. FDA requirement for maintenance of electronic records 
EU Annex 11 | EU GMP requirement for maintenance of electronic records 
21 CFR 203 | Drug sample tracking as required by the Prescription Drug Marketing Act 
PFSB Notification, No. 0401022 (Japan) | Use of Electromagnetic Records and Electronic Signatures for Approval of, or License for, Drugs

 
Each version of our solutions that are subject to regulations that require companies to maintain certain records and submit information to regulators as part of compliance verification undergoes validation testing against these and other relevant standards. Veeva develops a validation plan, performs installation qualification and operational qualification, and executes the protocols. The results of each validation are then reviewed and confirmed in a summary report by our quality and compliance team. We maintain a dedicated team of quality and compliance experts that manages our processes for meeting these requirements. The functions of this quality and compliance team include three separate domains: 
  
• | oversight of resource management, document management, computer validation, corrective and preventative action, and general quality oversight;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | oversight of audit and inspection management, supplier management, and regulatory intelligence; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Veeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K   9


 
• | management of customer audits, which is often a required due diligence step in customer purchase decisions and which are performed from time to time by our existing customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Veeva has designed and implemented a quality management system (QMS) that is aligned with our customers’ regulatory standards for IT compliance. Our QMS is maintained in our own Veeva Vault QualityDocs application and consists of the following: 
  
• | a comprehensive set of quality policies and procedures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | an independent quality assurance function that oversees development and maintenance of our software;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | audit support of our customers’ regulatory obligation to perform due diligence on their suppliers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | computer systems validation aligned with healthcare industry best practices as outlined in published regulatory standards;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a resource management program to ensure employees have the requisite demonstrable level of education, experience, and training; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a risk management program to identify product realization and other business risks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Security Program
 Veeva’s global information security officer oversees an information security management system certified to ISO 27001 to ensure security controls conform to established standards across both product and infrastructure components. Our solutions’ vulnerability is tested using internal tools prior to release, and we employ a third party to perform penetration and vulnerability tests on our solutions on at least an annual basis. We also obtain independent third-party audit opinions related to security and availability annually, such as SOC 2, Type II reports and ISO 27001 attestation reports. Our global information security officer also oversees information security and security awareness training and security incident response processes.
Privacy Program
 Our global data protection officer maintains a global privacy program aligned to industry standards and national regulations, including EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In addition, Veeva maintains privacy policies and procedures and provides role-based privacy awareness training. 
 Veeva has maintained its EU-U.S. Privacy Shield certification since 2016 and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield certification since 2017 in order to transfer and allow access of EU and Swiss personal data from the EU or Switzerland to the United States. Veeva also signs EU Standard Contractual Clauses with its customers who act as data controllers and exporters to facilitate international transfers of EU personal data. 
 In the European Union, Veeva is a data controller for data used in Veeva OpenData and Veeva Oncology Link and a data processor for the rest of our products. Veeva is currently in compliance with the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, which will be superseded by GDPR on May 25, 2018. 
 In the United States, Veeva also complies with the patient privacy rules under the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 that protect medical records and other personal health information by signing business associate agreements when requested by our customers.

Research and Development 
 Our R&D organization is responsible for the design, development, and testing of our solutions and applications. Based on customer feedback and needs, we focus our efforts on developing new solutions functionality, applications, and core technologies and further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance, and flexibility of existing solutions and applications. Research and development expenses were $66.0 million, $96.8 million and $132.1 million for our fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
Competition 
 The markets for our solutions are global, rapidly evolving, highly competitive and subject to changing regulations, advancing technology and shifting customer needs. The solutions and applications offered by our competitors vary in size, breadth, and scope. 
 Our multichannel CRM applications compete with offerings from large global enterprise software vendors, such as Oracle Corporation and Microsoft Corporation, and also compete with life sciences-specific CRM providers, such as IQVIA Inc., formerly QuintilesIMS. We also compete with a number of vendors of cloud-based and on-premise CRM applications that address only a portion of the functionality of our CRM solutions. Our master data management solutions compete with master data solutions offered by vendors such as IBM Corporation, Informatica Corporation, IQVIA, and Reltio, Inc. Our data and data services offerings compete with IQVIA and many other data providers. Our Veeva Vault content management solutions compete with offerings from large global content management platform vendors such as Microsoft, OpenText Corporation and Oracle, and with offerings from life sciences specific providers, such as Medidata Solutions, Inc., PAREXEL International Corporation, IQVIA, BioClinica, Inc., and Sparta Technologies Ltd. We also compete with professional services companies that provide solutions on these platforms, such as DXC Technology Company. 
 In the future, providers of horizontal cloud-based solutions and platforms, such as Box.com, Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft, and third parties that build on their platforms, may seek to compete with us. In addition, we have begun selling certain of our Veeva Vault applications to companies outside the life sciences industry. We have limited experience selling certain of our Veeva Vault applications to companies outside the life sciences industry, and, therefore, we anticipate having to compete with many existing solutions, including those listed above, custom-built software developed by third-party vendors or in-house by our potential customers and niche software providers. 
 We may also face competition from custom-built software developed by third-party vendors or developed in-house by our potential customers, or from applications built by our customers or by third parties on behalf of our customers using commercially available software platforms that are provided by third parties. We may also face competition from companies that provide cloud-based solutions in different target or horizontal markets that may develop applications or work with companies that operate in our target markets. With the introduction of new technologies, we expect competition to intensify in the future, and we may face competition from new market entrants as well.
 In some cases, our competitors are well-established providers of competitive solutions and have long-standing relationships with many of our current and potential customers, including large pharmaceutical and emerging biopharmaceutical companies. Oracle and IQVIA, for example, each have greater name recognition, much longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, and significantly greater resources than we do. 
 Many of our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than we are able to devote. Such competitors may be able to initiate or withstand substantial price competition and may offer solutions competitive to certain of our solutions on a standalone basis at a lower price or bundled as part of a larger product sale, including the bundling of software solutions and data. In addition, many of our competitors have established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and distribution agreements with consultants, system 
 Veeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K   11


integrators and resellers that we do not have. Our competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their product offerings or resources.
 In addition, in order to take advantage of customer demand for cloud-based solutions, such competitors may expand their cloud-based solutions through acquisitions and organic development or may seek to partner with other leading cloud providers. For instance, in October 2016, IMS Health Holding, Inc. and Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc., a contract research organization, combined to form Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc., which now operates under the name IQVIA. The combined entity competes with us in a number of product areas, including software solutions, data and data services. The impact of this transaction on our competitive environment is uncertain but increased competition from IQVIA could negatively impact our business. Additionally, IQVIA has partnered with Reltio to resell certain of Reltio’s master data management offerings, which could also negatively impact our business.
 We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following: 
  
• | level of customer satisfaction;
--+--------------------------------


• | regulatory compliance verification and functionality;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | domain expertise with respect to life sciences;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | ease of deployment and use of solutions and applications;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | breadth and depth of solution and application functionality;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | brand awareness and reputation;
--+--------------------------------


• | modern and adaptive technology platform;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | capability for customization, configurability, integration, security, scalability and reliability of applications;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | total cost of ownership;
--+-------------------------


• | ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | size of customer base and level of user adoption;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | ability to secure the rights to load and process third party proprietary data licensed by customers; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we generally compete favorably on the basis of these factors and that the domain expertise required for developing and deploying successful solutions in the life sciences industry may hinder new entrants that are unable to invest the necessary capital to develop solutions that can address the functionality, requirements and regulatory compliance capabilities needed for the life sciences industry. Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance in the areas of solution and application development and customer support.

Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We have developed a process for seeking patent protection for our technology innovations. As of January 31, 2018, we have secured 13 U.S. patents and two Japanese patents, which expire between May 2023 and December 2036, and we have 33 pending U.S. patent applications and seven pending international patent applications. Our patents and patent applications cover technology within the following of our product categories: Veeva Commercial Cloud, Veeva Vault Platform, Veeva Vault Clinical, and Veeva Vault RIM. We plan to continue expanding our patent portfolio. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Although we rely on our intellectual property rights, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new features and functionality and frequent enhancements to our applications are essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position as provider of software solutions and applications to the life sciences industry. 
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our application. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult, and protection of our rights through civil enforcement mechanisms may be expensive and time consuming. 
 Companies in our industry often own a number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. We are currently engaged in legal proceedings with competitors in which the competitors are asserting trade secret misappropriation and other claims, and we may face new allegations in the future that we have infringed the patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights of other competitors or non-practicing entities. We expect that we and others in our industry will continue to be subject to third-party infringement claims by competitors as the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps, and by non-practicing entities. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time. For example, see the description of our current litigations in note 11 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
