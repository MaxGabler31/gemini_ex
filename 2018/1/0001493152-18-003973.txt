Item 1. | Business
------------+---------

Introduction
 
We are a blank check company formed in the British Virgin Islands on January 23, 2017 as a business company with limited liability. This means that our shareholders have no additional liability for our liabilities over and above the amount paid for their shares. We were formed for the purpose of acquiring, engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation with, purchasing all or substantially all of the assets of, entering into contractual arrangements with, or engaging in any other similar business combination, with one or more businesses or entities. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities, activities related to our IPO, and activities related to an initial business combination. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business have not been limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although we have focused our search on target businesses and assets in the energy services industry, with an emphasis on oil and gas services globally (with an initial focus on North America, Europe, Asia and Africa). Our management believes this area of focus represents a favorable and highly fragmented market opportunity to consummate an initial business combination.
 
We seek to capitalize on the 60 years of experience in the oil and gas business of the two executives leading the company: Sherif Foda and Tom Wood. Mr. Foda was an officer of Schlumberger Limited (NYSE: SLB) with over 24 years of experience in managing a variety of businesses and operations globally. He most recently managed a portfolio of $20 billion revenue each year and oversaw 30,000 employees at Schlumberger Limited. Mr. Wood was the Chief Executive Officer of Xtreme Drilling Corp. (TSX: XDC), a leading drilling, workover and coil tubing company, doing business in North America, the Middle East and Asia. Previously, Mr. Wood founded and ran more than six companies. Messrs. Foda and Wood have a wealth of knowledge, client relations, business acumen, and track records of mergers and acquisitions.
 
We intend to identify and acquire businesses that could benefit from the strong operations background of our management team, with the broad expertise they have in oilfield services globally. Since even fundamentally sound companies can often under-perform their potential due to a temporary period of dislocation in the markets in which they operate, inefficient capital allocation, over-levered capital structures, excessive cost structures, incomplete management teams and/or inappropriate business strategies, we believe that we will be able to locate an attractive target business to acquire. Our management team has extensive experience in identifying and executing acquisitions across the global energy market including the upstream and service sectors of the oil and gas services industry. In the past five years, our management team has been involved in over 20 mergers and acquisitions transactions valued at more than $2 billion. In addition, our team has significant hands-on experience working with private investors and international companies. In the event that we elect to pursue an investment outside of the oil and gas services industry, our management’s expertise related to that industry may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained herein regarding this industry might not be relevant to an understanding of the business or asset that we elect to acquire.
 
We believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive risk-adjusted returns in the marketplace and that their contacts and transaction sources, ranging from industry executives, private owners, and investment bankers, in addition to the extensive global industry and geographical reach of management’s past experience, will enable us to pursue a broad range of opportunities. Our management believes that its ability to identify and implement value creation initiatives will remain central to its differentiated acquisition strategy. However, there is no assurance that we will complete an initial business combination nor is there any guarantee that such initial business combination will be successful. The members of our management team are not required to devote any significant amount of time to our business and are concurrently involved with other businesses. There is no guarantee that our current officers and directors will continue in their respective roles, or in any other role, after our initial business combination, and their expertise may only be of benefit to us until our initial business combination is completed, if at all.
 
Our management team’s objective is to generate attractive returns and create value for our stockholders by applying a disciplined strategy of effecting changes in a target business after making an acquisition to unlock value. We favor companies with certain elements of downside protection, for example, companies with multiple year contracts, proven infrastructure, good governance and credibility in the market place in which they operate.
 
We have until May 17, 2019 to consummate our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate the Business Combination or an alternative initial business combination by May 17, 2019, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under British Virgin Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

On November 12, 2017, we entered into two stock purchase agreements, namely the Stock Purchase Agreement (“NPS Stock Purchase Agreement”) for shares of NPS Holdings Limited (“NPS”) and the Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of Shares in Gulf Energy S.A.O.C. (“GES Stock Purchase Agreement” and, together with the NPS Stock Purchase Agreement, the “Stock Purchase Agreements”), along with related contracts, all of which collectively provide for: (i) our acquisition of all of the outstanding issued shares and other equity interests in NPS, and (ii) our acquisition, directly and through our wholly owned subsidiary, National Energy Services Reunited Corporation, a Texas corporation, of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock in Gulf Energy S.A.O.C. (“GES”). These two proposed acquisitions and related transactions collectively shall be referenced hereafter as the “Business Combination.” Consummation of the Business Combination is subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including the approval of the Business Combination by our shareholders in accordance with our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the completion of a redemption offer whereby we will be providing our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their ordinary shares for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit in our trust account (net of taxes payable).


The Stock Purchase Agreements and related agreements are further described in the Form 8-K filed by the Company on November 16, 2017. For additional information regarding NPS and GES, the Stock Purchase Agreements and the Business Combination, see the Proxy Statement.
 
Other than as specifically discussed, this report does not assume that the closing of the Business Combination will occur.
 
Significant Activities Since Inception
 
Since inception, all activity of the Company has related to the Company’s formation, its IPO, which is described below, and identifying a target company for an initial business combination.
 
The registration statement for the Company’s IPO was declared effective on May 11, 2017. On May 17, 2017, the Company consummated its IPO, issuing 21,000,000 units and generating gross proceeds of $210,000,000. Each unit consisted of one ordinary share and one warrant to purchase one-half of one ordinary share at an exercise price of $5.75 per half share ($11.50 per whole share).
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the sale of 11,850,000 private warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant in a private placement to the Company’s Sponsor, NESR Holdings Ltd., generating gross proceeds of $5,925,000.
 
Following the closing of the IPO on May 17, 2017, an amount of $210,000,000 ($10.00 per unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in the IPO and the private warrants was placed in a trust account. Funds in the trust account must be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of an initial business combination or (ii) the distribution of the trust account, as described below.


On May 30, 2017, in connection with the underwriters’ election to partially exercise their over-allotment option, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 1,921,700 units at a price of $10.00 per unit and the sale of an additional 768,680 private warrants at a price of $0.50 per warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $19,601,340. Following the closing, an additional $19,217,000 of net proceeds ($10.00 per unit) was placed in the trust account, resulting in a total of $229,217,000 ($10.00 per unit) being held in the trust account.
 
Transaction costs related to the IPO amounted to $13,761,498, consisting of $4,014,340 of underwriting fees, $9,032,265 ($7,025,095 in cash and 200,717 ordinary shares) of deferred underwriting fees and $714,893 of IPO costs. As of December 31, 2017, $741,096 of cash was held outside of the trust account and was available for working capital purposes.
 
Our units began trading on May 12, 2017 on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “NESRU.” Commencing on June 5, 2017, the units ceased trading and separated into their component securities, which ordinary shares and public warrants began separately trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols “NESR” and “NESRW,” respectively.
 
Stock Purchase Agreements
 
As discussed above, on November 12, 2017, we entered into the Stock Purchase Agreements and related agreements, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, the Company will acquire NPS and GES.
 
Pursuant to the NPS Stock Purchase Agreement, NESR will acquire 100% of the equity interests of NPS from its selling stockholders and Hana Investments Co. WLL (“Hana Investments”). Hana Investments purchased, in cash, an aggregate of 83,660,878 NPS shares on January 14, 2018, and has agreed to exchange such NPS shares for NESR ordinary shares in connection with the Business Combination. As consideration for the acquisition of NPS, we agreed to: (i) issue an aggregate of 25,077,276 of our ordinary shares, which includes 11,318,827 ordinary shares at a value of $10.00 per share to the NPS selling stockholders and 13,340,448 shares to Hana Investments at a value of $11.244 per share, plus interest of up to $4.7 million payable in cash or ordinary shares to Hana Investments at the value of $11.244 per share or 418,001 ordinary shares, plus (ii) issue up to an additional 3,343,408 ordinary shares that may be issued pursuant to certain equity earn-outs, (iii) pay total cash of $292.8 million, (iv) potentially pay an additional $7,572,444 pursuant to a cash earn-out and (v) additional interest factor fees (“Ticker Fee”) that accrue to NPS selling stockholders from January 1, 2018, until the consideration is paid under the NPS Stock Purchase Agreement, upon the closing of the Business Combination.

NESR will acquire GES by acquiring 61% of the GES capital stock from certain GES selling stockholders directly pursuant to the GES Stock Purchase Agreement, 11.7% of the GES capital stock pursuant to a Shares Exchange Agreement with our Sponsor, which acquired such GES stock through certain loan agreements (“Loan Contracts”) with 11 separate investors (“GES Investors”), and 27.3% of the GES stock pursuant to a Contribution Agreement with SV3 Holdings Pte Ltd, which acquired such GES shares in October 2017 independently of NESR. As consideration for the purchase of the aforementioned GES capital stock, we agreed to issue an aggregate of 28,234,848 (plus approximately $1.25 million for interest accrued on loans pending closing) of our ordinary shares at a value of $10.00 per share.
 
In connection with the Business Combination, the Company expects to enter into a forward purchase agreement for up to $150 million (the “Backstop Commitment”) with parties arranged by MEA Energy Advisory UK, LLP or its affiliates (“Backstop Investor”), pursuant to which the Company will draw down a minimum of $70 million at $10.00 per share, and will have the option to draw up to an additional $80 million at $11.244 per share, as needed. The funds will be used to replace capital removed to pay shareholder redemptions, to help fund the cash portion of the consideration to the NPS selling stockholders and transaction expenses in the Business Combination, or other corporate purposes, such that the Company meets its minimum cash requirements immediately following the Business Combination. The Backstop Investor will have no obligation to purchase any NESR ordinary shares until definitive agreements are entered into. NESR expects the definitive terms of the forward purchase agreement to be negotiated and agreed to before the Proxy Statement becomes definitive and is mailed to NESR shareholders. Additionally, the Backstop Commitment will be conditioned on the concurrent closing of the Business Combination and other customary closing conditions.


For additional information regarding the Business Combination, please see the Proxy Statement.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, build a company in the energy services industry that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from their operational expertise. Our acquisition strategy will leverage our team’s network of potential proprietary and public transaction sources where we believe a combination of our relationships, knowledge and experience in the energy services industry could effect a positive transformation or augmentation of existing businesses or properties to improve their overall value proposition.
Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with this strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We have been focusing our efforts on seeking and completing an initial business combination with a target entity that has an enterprise value of between $600 million and $1.25 billion, although a target entity with a smaller or larger enterprise value may be considered. We have used these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, including NPS and GES, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire companies that we believe:

● | can utilize the extensive networks and insights we have built in the energy services industry; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | are at an inflection point, such as requiring additional management expertise, are able to innovate through new operational techniques, or that we believe we can drive improved financial performance; 
● | are fundamentally sound companies that are underperforming their potential as a result of the current low price of oil and corresponding services; 
● | exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace; 
● | need new technology ideas and/or tools to reveal the full potential of the companies; and 
● | can enlarge its base of services and expand its geographical footprint from the current serving platform. 

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.
 
Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document review, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital allocation experience. We will seek opinions from its clients and the industry for the credibility and reputation of the target companies. For information regarding the due diligence review undertaken with respect to NPS and GES, see the Proxy Statement.

Initial Business Combination
 
We will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our shareholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we would be deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require that we conduct a tender offer under SEC rules rather than seeking shareholder approval). Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20.0% of our outstanding ordinary shares (unless we are deemed to be a foreign private issuer at such time) or seek to amend our memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval.
 
If we conduct a tender offer, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. If we seek shareholder approval, we will only consummate our initial business combination if a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted at the meeting at which such approval is sought are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
We will have until May 17, 2019 to consummate our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned (net of taxes payable), pro rata to our public shareholders by way of the redemption of their shares and will cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs, as further described herein. In such event, our warrants will expire worthless. Based on funds in the trust account of $230,554,024 as of December 31, 2017, the estimated per share redemption price would have been approximately $10.06 per ordinary share purchased in the IPO. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public shareholders.
 
Pursuant to NASDAQ listing rules, our initial business combination must be with a target business or businesses whose collective fair market value is at least equal to 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriters fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for such business combination, although this may entail simultaneous acquisitions of several target businesses. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The target business or businesses that we acquire may have a collective fair market value substantially in excess of 80% of the trust account balance.
 
We currently anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction parent company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we or a newly formed public holding company issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of the outstanding shares of the public parent company subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe our competitive strengths to be the following:
 
Status as a public company. We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses might find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely be reduced in connection with a business combination with us. Furthermore, once the business combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests than it would have as a privately-held company. Being public can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.

-


While we believe that our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a business combination with a more established entity or with a private company.
 
Financial position. With funds held in trust available for our initial business combination in the amount of $230,554,024 as of December 31, 2017, we offer a target business a variety of options such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing cash for stock, and providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. If needed, we may take steps to secure additional third party financing to fund our initial business combination. See “The Stock Purchase Agreements” above for a description of the proposed financing agreements that may be entered into in connection with the proposed Business Combination.


Management Operating and Investing Experience. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad international network of contacts and corporate relationships which we believe will serve as a useful source of investment opportunities. We will seek to capitalize on the global network and investing and operating experience of our management team to identify, acquire and operate one or more businesses or assets in the energy sector, although we may pursue a business combination outside of such industry.
 
We believe our management team has the skills and experience to identify, evaluate and consummate a business combination and is positioned to assist businesses we acquire. However, there is no assurance that we will complete an initial business combination nor is there any guarantee that such an initial business combination will be successful. The members of our management team are not required to devote any significant amount of time to our business and are concurrently involved with other businesses. There is no guarantee that our current officers and directors will continue in their respective roles, or in any other role, after our initial business combination, and their expertise may only be of benefit to us until our initial business combination is completed, if at all.
 
If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us.
 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial operations until the closing of our initial business combination. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our IPO and the private placement of private warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of these in effecting our initial business combination. Although substantially all of the net proceeds of our IPO and the private placement of private warrants are intended to be applied generally toward effecting a business combination, the proceeds are not otherwise being designated for any more specific purposes. Accordingly, investors have invested without first having an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any one or more business combinations. Our initial business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various Federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. We intend to effect the Business Combination using cash held in our trust account and, if needed, funds from third party sources, including the Backstop Investor. See “The Stock Purchase Agreements” above for a description of the proposed financing agreements that may be entered into in connection with the Business Combination. In the event we do not consummate the Business Combination, we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, but we may, as a result of our limited resources, effect only a single business combination.
Sources of Target Businesses
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our public filings and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. We may also engage professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We have no present intention to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or Sponsor. However, we are not restricted from entering into any such transactions and may do so if (1) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested and independent directors (if we have any at that time) and (2) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view. As of the date of this report, there are no affiliated entities that we would consider as a business combination target.

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination
 
Subject to the limitation that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. Except for the general criteria and guidelines set forth above under the caption “Our Strategy,” we have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. Furthermore, we do not have any specific requirements with respect to the value of a prospective target business as compared to our net assets or the funds held in the trust account.
 
Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination remain to be determined. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.
 
Fair Market Value of Target Business
 
Pursuant to NASDAQ listing rules, the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure a business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction parent company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we or a newly formed public holding company issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of the outstanding shares of the public parent company subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% trust account balance test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a public or private offering of debt or equity securities. As example, see “The Stock Purchase Agreements” above for a description of the proposed financing agreements that may be entered into in connection with the proposed Business Combination. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the Business Combination, we have obtained a written fairness opinion from J.P. Morgan, dated November 12, 2017, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion, the Consideration (as defined in the opinion) to be paid by the Company in the proposed Transactions (as defined in the opinion) was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company. For more information about the J.P. Morgan fairness opinion, see the Proxy Statement.

Lack of Business Diversification
 
We expect to complete only a single business combination, although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating businesses. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination;

● | result in our dependency upon the successful development, construction and operation of a single mining asset; and 
● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. 

 
If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.
 
Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’s Management Team
 
Although we intend to scrutinize the management team of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination, our assessment of the target business’s management team may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management team may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following our initial business combination remains to be determined. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of our initial business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, our officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We may not have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination
 
In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek shareholder approval of the business combination at a shareholders’ meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our shareholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case, subject to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. If we are deemed to be a foreign private issuer, we will conduct redemptions in accordance with the SEC’s tender offer rules.

11
--


Under NASDAQ’s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination (unless we are deemed to be a foreign private issuer at such time) if, for example:
 

● | we issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares then outstanding; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | any of our directors, officers or substantial shareholders (as defined by NASDAQ rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of ordinary shares could result in an increase in outstanding ordinary shares or voting power of 5% or more; or 
● | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control. 

 
If we engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be conducted pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and structured so that each shareholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination.
 
We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares redeemed or sold to us) and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public shareholders may therefore have to wait 24 months from the closing of our IPO in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.
 
Our Sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to redeem any ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any ordinary shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. As a result, we would need only 8,595,638 shares, or 37.5% of the 22,921,700 public shares outstanding as of the date hereof, to be voted in favor of our initial business combination in order to have such transaction approved.
 
Although there is no commitment to do so, our officers, directors, Sponsor or their affiliates may purchase ordinary shares in the open market or in private transactions. In addition, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of shareholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, Sponsor or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, Sponsor and their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.
 
Redemption Rights
 
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, any public shareholder, whether voting for or against such proposed business combination, will be entitled to demand that their ordinary shares be redeemed for a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account (initially $10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account, net of taxes payable). Alternatively, we may provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their ordinary shares to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable).


Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 20% or more of the ordinary shares sold in our IPO. Accordingly, if an investor purchased more than 20% of the ordinary shares sold in our IPO and our proposed Business Combination is approved, he/she will not be able to seek redemption rights with respect to the full amount of his/her shares and may be forced to hold such additional ordinary shares or sell them in the open market. Such a public shareholder would still be entitled to vote against a proposed business combination with respect to all ordinary shares owned by him or his affiliates. We believe this restriction will prevent shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares before the vote held to approve a proposed business combination and attempt to use the redemption right as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a substantial premium to the then current market price.
 
Our Sponsor, as well as our officers and directors, will not have redemption rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly, except in the case of our liquidation if we do not complete a business combination as described below.
 
We may also require public shareholders who wish to redeem, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent at any time through the vote on the business combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option.

--


There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders to deliver their shares prior to the vote on the business combination in order to exercise redemption rights. This is because a holder would need to deliver shares to exercise redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require shareholders to exercise redemption rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.
 
Any request to redeem such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their redemption and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
 
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to have their shares redeemed.
 
Liquidation if No Business Combination
 
If we do not complete a business combination by May 17, 2019, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned (net of taxes payable), pro rata to our public shareholders by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the purposes of winding up of our affairs. This redemption of public shareholders from the trust account shall be done automatically by function of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and prior to any voluntary winding up, although at all times subject to the Companies Act.
 
Following the redemption of public shares, we intend to enter “voluntary liquidation” which is the statutory process for formally closing and dissolving a company under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. Given that we intend to enter voluntary liquidation following the redemption of public shareholders from the trust account, we do not expect that the voluntary liquidation process will cause any delay to the payment of redemption proceeds from our trust account. In connection with such a voluntary liquidation, the liquidator would give notice to creditors inviting them to submit their claims for payment, by notifying known creditors (if any) who have not submitted claims and by placing a public advertisement in at least one newspaper published in the British Virgin Islands and in at least one newspaper circulating in the location where the company has its principal place of business, and taking any other steps he considers appropriate to identify the company’s creditors, after which our remaining assets would be distributed. As soon as the affairs of the company are fully wound-up, the liquidator must complete his statement of account and make a notificational filing with the Registrar. We would be dissolved once the Registrar issues a Certificate of Dissolution.
 
Our Sponsor has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its insider shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable period from the closing of our IPO.
 
However, if our Sponsor, or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquire public shares in or after our IPO, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required time period. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination by May 17, 2019. We will pay the costs of our liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. However, the liquidator may determine that he or it requires additional time to evaluate creditors’ claims (particularly if there is uncertainty over the validity or extent of the claims of any creditors). Also, a creditor or shareholder may file a petition with the BVI court which, if successful, may result in our liquidation being subject to the supervision of that court. Such events might delay distribution of some or all of our remaining assets.
 
Additionally, in any liquidation proceedings of the company under British Virgin Islands law, the funds held in our trust account may be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any such claims deplete the trust account we may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts payable to them.
 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our IPO, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00 as of December 31, 2017. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors, which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. The actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00, plus interest (net of any taxes payable).

Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our Sponsor agreed that it will be liable to us, if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below $10.00 per share, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. However, our Sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. We have not independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations. We believe the likelihood of our Sponsor having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.00 per share and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy any applicable obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, due to claims of creditors, the actual value of the per-share redemption price may be less than $10.00 per share.
 
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to amounts not placed in the trust account (which as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $741,000) with which to pay any such potential claims. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
 
If we are deemed insolvent for the purposes of the Insolvency Act (i.e. (i) we fail to comply with the requirements of a statutory demand that has not been set aside under section 157 of the Insolvency Act; (ii) execution or other process issued on a judgment, decree or order of a British Virgin Islands Court in favor of a creditor of the company is returned wholly or partly unsatisfied; or (iii) either the value of the company’s liabilities exceeds its assets, or the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due), then there are very limited circumstances where prior payments made to shareholders or other parties may be deemed to be a “voidable transaction” for the purposes of the Insolvency Act. A voidable transaction would include, for these purposes, payments made as “unfair preferences” or “transactions at an undervalue”. A liquidator appointed over an insolvent company who considers that a particular transaction or payment is a voidable transaction under the Insolvency Act could apply to the British Virgin Islands Courts for an order setting aside that payment or transaction in whole or in part.
 
Additionally, if we enter insolvent liquidation under the Insolvency Act, the funds held in our trust account will likely be included in our estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any insolvency claims deplete the trust account you may not be able to return to our public shareholders the liquidation amounts due them.
 
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of a redemption to public shareholders prior to any winding up in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination or our liquidation or if they redeem their shares in connection with an initial business combination that we consummate. In no other circumstances shall a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our IPO, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.

14
--


The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:
 

● | our obligation to seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our obligation to redeem ordinary shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination; 
● | our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent; 
● | our obligation to either repay or issue private warrants upon conversion of up to $1,500,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates; and 
● | our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the private warrants (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans. 

 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
If we succeed in effecting our initial business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. Subsequent to our initial business combination, we may not have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
 
Facilities
 
We currently maintain our principal executive offices at 777 Post Oak Blvd., Suite 730, Houston, Texas 77056. The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per-month fee our Sponsor charges us for general and administrative services pursuant to a letter agreement between us and our Sponsor. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in Houston, Texas, that the fee charged by our Sponsor is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. We consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers, adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We have two executive officers, neither of whom is paid a salary by us. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
 
We have registered our ordinary shares and public warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual report will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We have provided shareholders with audited financial statements of NPS and GES in the Proxy Statement, and in the event that the Business Combination is not consummated, we will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of another prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.
 
We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
