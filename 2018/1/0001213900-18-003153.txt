ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
-------------------------------------------------+----------

Overview 
 
With advanced technologies and a unique business model, we, as a service provider of in-flight entertainment and connectivity, or IFEC, solutions, intend to provide airline passengers with a broadband in-flight experience that encompasses a wide range of service options. Such options include Wi-Fi, cellular, movies, gaming, live TV, and music. We plan to offer these core services, which we are currently still developing, through both built-in in-flight entertainment systems, such as a seat-back display, as well as on passengers’ personal devices. We also expect to provide content management services and e-commerce solutions related to our IFEC solutions.
 
We plan to partner with airlines and offer airline passengers free IFEC services. We plan to generate revenue through advertising and in-flight transactions. We believe that this is an innovative approach that differentiates us from existing market players.
 
To complement and facilitate our planned IFEC service offerings, we intend to build satellite ground stations and related data centers within the geographic regions where we expect to be providing IFEC airline services. Initially, we are planning to build our first ground station and data center in the Asia region, subject to the availability of sufficient capital and an appropriate ground location.
 
Our Corporate History and Structure
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 14, 2013 under the name Maple Tree Kids, Inc. We were incorporated in order to acquire by merger all of the limited liability company interests of Maple Tree Kids LLC, a Vermont limited liability company, or MTK LLC, which was completed on September 27, 2013. Our company was the surviving company in the merger and the separate existence of MTK LLC ceased and we succeeded to all of the assets of MTK LLC as a result of the merger. Upon completion of the merger, we were initially engaged in the business of selling infant and toddler products through the internet.
 
On December 28, 2016, Aircom purchased 700,000 shares of our common stock held by Ms. Irina Goldman, our then sole director, officer and principal stockholder, for $320,000, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement among Aircom, Ms. Goldman and our company dated as of that date. Such shares represented approximately 86.3% of our issued and outstanding common stock as of the closing. Accordingly, as a result of the transaction, Aircom became the controlling stockholder of our company.
 
On January 10, 2017, we changed our name to Aerkomm Inc. in anticipation of our new business.
 
On February 13, 2017, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Aircom in exchange for 40,000,000 shares of our common stock. In addition, at the closing of the acquisition, Aircom returned all 700,000 shares of our common stock held by it and we immediately cancelled such shares. As a result of this transaction, Aircom became our wholly-owned subsidiary and the former shareholders of Aircom became the holders of approximately 87.81% of our issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully-diluted basis. For accounting purposes, the share exchange transaction with Aircom was treated as a reverse acquisition, with Aircom as the acquirer and our company as the acquired party. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this report to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the acquisition, we are referring to the business and financial information of Aircom and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Following the consummation of this acquisition, we discontinued our business of selling infant and toddler products through the internet and instead solely engaged in the business of providing IFEC solutions through Aircom.
 
Upon the closing of the reverse acquisition on February 13, 2017, Mr. Jeffrey Wun, our sole director and President, Treasurer and Secretary, resigned from his positions as President, Treasurer and Secretary. On the same date, the following persons were appointed to our board of directors: Peter Chiou, Jan-Yung Lin, Colin Lim and Barbie Shih. In addition, Peter Chiou was appointed as our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President.
 
On December 29, 2017, stockholders of the Company holding 33,230,902 shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock, or approximately 80.15% of the outstanding common stock of the Company, voted by written consent in lieu of an annual meeting to elect the following six (6) persons to the board of directors of the Company to serve until the Company’s next annual meeting or until their resignations are duly tendered and accepted: Jeffrey Wun, Jan-Yung Lin, Colin Lim, Raymond Choy, Chih-Ming (Albert) Hsu, and James J. Busuttil. Peter Chiou, Barbie Shih and Robert Lu were not re-elected to the Company’s board of directors under the stockholders’ written consent in lieu of annual meeting.
 
On December 30, 2017, the Company’s board of directors by unanimous written consent appointed Mr. Jeffrey Wun as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective December 31, 2017. Mr. Chiou resigned from these positions, effective December 31, 2017, and is expected to become a consultant to the Company for a short period of time. On January 22, 2018, our board of directors appointed Mr. Wun as its chairman.

We are a holding company. All of our business operations are conducted through Aircom and its subsidiaries. The chart below presents our corporate structure as of the date of this report:
 

On October 13, 2016, Aircom acquired Aircom HK for $100,000. Aircom HK is a Hong Kong limited company formed on October 3, 2008 as Yanwei Information Technology Limited. Aircom HK changed its name to Dadny Inc Limited on July 22, 2015 and changed its name again to Aircom Pacific Inc. Limited on July 22, 2015. Aircom HK is in charge of all of Aircom’s business and operations in Hong Kong and China. Aircom HK is applying for, and will be the holder of a Validation of Supplemental Type Certificate, or VSTC, issued by the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department, or HKCAD. Presently, Aircom HK’s primary function is business development, both with respect to airlines as well as content providers and advertising partners based in Hong Kong and China. It is also actively seeking strategic partnerships in those areas, through which Aircom may leverage its product offerings to provide enhanced services to prospective customers. Aircom also plans to provide local support to Hong Kong-based airlines via Aircom HK and Aircom HK owned teleports located in the Hong Kong areas.
 
On December 12, 2016, Aircom acquired Aircom Japan for $600,000. Aircom Japan was formed under the law of Japan on August 29, 2011 as Dadny (Japan) Inc. and changed its name to Aircom Japan, Inc. on July 1, 2016. Aircom Japan is responsible for Aircom’s business development efforts and general operations located within Japan. Aircom Japan is applying for, and will be the holder of, a Satellite Communication Blanket License, which is necessary for Aircom to provide services within Japan. Aircom Japan will also provide local support to airlines operate within the territory of Japan. We do not expect to be in a position to successfully launch our service offerings in Japan until sometime in 2019.
 
Aircom Seychelles was formed by Aircom under the laws of Seychelles on December 15, 2009 as Gulach Ltd. and changed its name to Aircom Pacific Ltd. on August 19, 2014. Aircom Seychelles was formed to facilitate Aircom’s global corporate structure for both business operations and tax planning. Presently, Aircom Seychelles has no operations. Aircom is working with corporate and tax advisers in finalizing its global corporate structure and has not yet concluded its final plan of organization.
 
Aircom Taiwan, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Aircom in December 2017, was organized under the laws of Taiwan on June 29, 2016. During the first two quarters of 2017, Aircom advanced a total of $425,000 to Aircom Taiwan, which was not during that time affiliated with Aircom, for working capital, as part of a planned $1,500,000 aggregate equity investment in Aircom Taiwan. Before Aircom Taiwan could issue equity to Aircom, because Aircom was a “foreign national” under Taiwan law, the investment must be approved by the Investment Review Committee of the Ministry of Economic affairs of Taiwan, or the Committee. Aircom entered into an Equity Pre-Subscription Agreement with Aircom Taiwan on August 13, 2017 to memorialize the terms of the proposed investment. Subsequent to June 30, 2017, Aircom advanced an additional $25,000 to Aircom Taiwan for working capital purposes. On December 19, 2017, the Committee approved Aircom’s initial equity investment (valued as of that date at NT$15,150,000, or approximately US$500,000) and the purchase of the founding owner’s total equity of NT$100,000 (approximately US$3,350). As a result, Aircom Taiwan became a wholly owned subsidiary of Aircom.


Aircom Taiwan is responsible for Aircom’s business development efforts and general operations within Taiwan.  We are currently planning to locate the site of our first ground station in Taiwan and we expect that if we raise sufficient funds to move forward with this project (although that cannot be guaranteed), Aircom Taiwan will play a significant role in building and operating that ground station.
 
Our Industry
 
According to William Blair’s equity report titled “The Internet of Everything,” dated January 30, 2017, commercial in-flight connectivity, or IFC, is a rapidly growing $6 billion market. Global industry penetration of commercial aircraft installed with IFC has grown from less than 1% in 2008 to 25% in 2016, with the expectation of 60%-plus by 2022. Industry growth should occur from not only increased penetration, but also expected increases in the average revenue generated per aircraft.  
 
The global IFEC market is expected to experience high growth due to factors such as aircraft expansion, increasing passenger rates, rising penetration rates, and technological advances. The global IFEC market revenue was forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 49.7% (2013 Global Industry Analyst Report). The Asia Pacific region is expected to experience more rapid growth because of the demand from a huge population. Boeing estimates that commercial aircraft will increase from 22,510 planes in 2015 to more than 45,000 in 2035, according to its 2016 market report.

Our Business Model
 
We believe that our business model sets us apart from our competitors. We combine cutting-edge connectivity technology with a unique content-driven approach. Traditionally, providers of in-flight connectivity focus primarily on the profit margin derived from the sale of hardware to airlines and of bandwidth to passengers. Both airlines and passengers have to “pay to play,” which results in low participation and usage rates. We break away from this model and set a new trend with our business model, under which neither airlines nor passengers need to pay for products or services. Furthermore, our business plan will provide our future airline partners with an opportunity to participate in our revenue sharing model. Taken together, this novel approach creates incentive for the airlines to work with us while driving passenger usage rates to levels management believes could reach 90% or more, considering the fact that many passengers now carry more than one smart device.
 
Our main source of revenue is expected to be derived from the content channeled through our network. In other words, we plan to use connectivity as a tool rather than as a commodity for sale, which we believe will allow us to achieve a greater return. By providing free connectivity and a large volume of content, we believe that we will generate a multiplying effect that will result in a value that exceeds the “sum of its parts.” Through our extended products, continuously expanding content network, and integrated service, we expect to deliver a total end-to-end solution for our customers, along with uninterrupted professional and social life to passengers during air travel.
 
We expect that our business will generate revenue primarily through revenue sharing with select partners. Our revenue partners include Internet companies, content providers, advertisers, telecom service providers, e-commerce, and premium sponsors. In addition, we expect to generate income from selling premium access passes to frequent flyers which would enable the holders to access our network with less restrictions and fewer interruptions from advertisement.
 
We expect to launch our business offerings in 2018, initially in China or Southeast Asia. We may expand our operations to other international markets if we determine that we can compete in such markets.
 
Our IFEC Solutions
 
We plan to provide airline passengers with a broadband in-flight experience that encompasses a wide range of service options. Such options include WiFi, cellular, movies, gaming, live TV, and music. We plan to offer our services through both built-in in-flight entertainment systems, such as a seatback display, as well as on passengers’ personal devices. We also plan to provide related content management services and on-board e-commerce solutions.
Our Connectivity Solutions
 
We expect to bring connectivity on-board aircraft with communication satellites. As depicted in the diagram below, aircraft equipped with connectivity instruments can communicate with satellites via an airborne antenna. The satellite then relays the information to a ground station, which is equipped with a high-power satellite dish and is connected to the internet through our proprietary ground system.

Satellites can communicate on different microwave frequency bands. The higher the frequency, the faster the rate at which data transmits. However, higher frequency waves are more susceptible to interference from the environment, such as rain fade. Most in-flight connectivity systems currently rely on the Ku-band for communication, though many players in the market are working to provide higher bandwidth and faster transmitting rates using the Ka-band. However, there are few Ka-enabled satellites, which limits the coverage area. We are developing a hybrid Ka/Ku satellite communication system that enables a high throughput where Ka-band coverage is available and offers global coverage where it is not. Our policy engine will make near real-time decisions based on best available bandwidth to choose between Ka and Ku-bands. In an area where Ka and Ku-band coverage overlaps, our airborne system can use both Ka and Ku-band bandwidth or choose the best option based on capacity, cost, and loading. It can also roam seamlessly between Ka and Ku-band satellites when the aircraft is moving in to or out of the Ka-band coverage area.
 
Our dual band system architecture brings our airline customers and their passengers the benefits of both Ka and Ku-band satellite technology. The Ka-band increases data throughput, while the Ku-band offers reliable service outside of the Ka-band coverage area or when Ka-band is not available due to weather or other interference.
 
In July 2015, we entered into a digital transmission service agreement with Asia Satellite Telecommunications Company Limited, or AsiaSat, for use of its AsiaSat 7 and 8 satellites, which provide access to both Ku and Ka-bands in China and Southeast Asia, for the provision of telecommunication services, including internet service. This agreement runs for a period of three years from its date of commencement, December 31, 2015. We paid AsiaSat a deposit of $775,000, which will be held by AsiaSat as security for our payment obligations and which AsiaSat may apply towards any defaults in such obligations. We are required to pay AsiaSat an annual service fee of $3,100,000, on a quarterly basis. The contract was subsequently suspended and both sides reached a settlement with respect to the Agreement in July 2017.
 
In March 2017, we entered into a Master Service Agreement with SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation for use of its JCSAT-2B/Asia Beam Ku-band satellite telecommunication services, teleport services and housing services. The agreement’s initial term runs for a period of three years from its commencement date of April 15, 2017, subject to the receipt of all governmental licenses and approval, and will continue be effective provided any of the services continues after the initial term. We are required to prepay $285,300 and a security deposit plus applicable Japanese consumption tax upon commencement date.

We are actively working with other satellite providers in order to accommodate airlines’ global routes and growing fleets. We are monitoring the satellite industry for growth in coverage, with recent attention on China Satcom’s plan to launch high-capacity Ka-band and Ka HTS multispot-beam satellites over the Asia Pacific region.
 
We plan to provide airline partners with the equipment necessary for in-flight connectivity, which is to be installed by the maintenance, repair, and overhaul service provider, or MRO, selected by the airline. The main components of each installation kit include a radome, one antenna each for Ka and Ku-band, a modem, servers, and wireless access points, among others. The complete bill of materials encompasses more than 5,000 individual parts and components. All components of the installation kit will require an Supplemental Type Certificate, or STC, from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, or its equivalents in the relevant jurisdiction. For aircraft outside of the FAA’s jurisdiction, an additional VSTC for the jurisdiction is required. Each aircraft type requires its own STC and VSTC as needed. For example, a STC for an Airbus A320 would not permit us to install the same equipment onboard a Boeing 737.
 
On October 15, 2014, our subsidiary, Aircom, entered into an agreement with dMobile System Co., Ltd., or dMobile, a Taiwanese corporation whose Chairman of the Board is Daniel Shih, our co-founder, a former material beneficial owner of our common stock and the husband of Barbie Shih, one of our former directors, for the delivery to dMobile of ground station equipment to be resold to Priceplay Taiwan Inc., or PPTW, of which Mr. Shih may be a deemed beneficial owner. According to the terms of this agreement, the purchase price for the initial system was $10,202,455, which was reduced to $6,980,000 on March 10, 2015. We delivered the initial system to dMobile on October 20, 2015 and the purchase price receivable from dMobile was offset by our payable to dMobile for a certain software purchase and a portion of the $1,000,000 prepayment dMobile paid towards the ground station equipment purchase price, leaving a balance owed by Aircom to dMobile of $471,100. In March 2017, due to changes in ground station equipment technology, both parties mutually agreed to terminate the contracts between them and dMobile agreed to accept 94,220 shares of our common stock in settlement of the $471,100 balance. For a more detailed discussion of this settlement agreement, see “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence” below. 
 
We will work with our hardware providers to obtain the necessary STCs or VSTCs for individual aircraft types. We will also provide training and technical support to each airline’s MRO services provider(s) for the installation of our equipment. Such support will also include technical, management, and operational support, with 24/7 network monitoring of the performance of each aircraft’s equipment.
 
Our Content Solutions
 
Traditionally, airlines view in-flight entertainment content as a budgeted expense for which they have to pay hefty royalties. With our business model and technologies, we are able to transform in-flight entertainment into a source of revenue for our airline customers. We are teaming up with our current and future prospective airline customers to provide free onboard Wi-Fi services to passengers, which allows us to maintain data traffic control, specifically in terms of blocking or placing advertisements as needed and inserting targeted commercials.
Premium Content Sponsorship
 
Recently, merchants have begun to take advantage of in-flight connectivity. In May of 2015, Amazon announced its plan to sponsor free video and music streaming for its Prime Video subscribers onboard JetBlue’s planes. The Amazon and JetBlue partnership is a paradigm of a win-win affiliation between an Internet powerhouse and a provider of in-flight connectivity. Amazon gained a platform through which it could display its premium subscription services and expanded its distribution network, while JetBlue generated significant revenue simply by making its in-flight connectivity available to Amazon.
 
The Amazon-JetBlue partnership is only one of many examples whereby an Internet company can vastly increase its competitive edge by gaining access to in-flight connectivity. We seek to exemplify this type of relationship through collaboration with major Internet companies, such as a search engine company. We plan to promote the partner’s brand through its in-flight services by channeling all searches to the partner’s search engine. By designing the user interface around the partnered company, we can present passengers with an on-screen environment populated by its apps, logos, and colors, providing a powerful marketing tool for the company. We can also enhance recognition of our sponsors’ brand by creating a list of portals on the in-flight system’s home screen, which leads to each sponsor’s individual page where passengers can resume their normal entertainment, social, and professional activities.
 
We are actively negotiating with Internet content providers to establish premium sponsorships. We have entered into a memorandum of understanding with Yahoo! to provide bandwidth sponsorship with branding potential.
 
Live TV
 
We are negotiating with television providers along our airline partners’ flight routes to make live TV available through our IFEC system. Airlines can select live TV channels that are appropriate for each flight route. An Electronic Program Guide channel listing will be available for easy viewing and selection.
 
Several revenue sources will be available for live TV broadcasting, including commercials before and during programs, and banners at the bottom of the screen. Banner advertisements at the bottom of the screen can be interactive which will generate pay per click, or PPC, or cost per click, or CPC, revenue in addition to the lower priced cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, revenue. In addition, we could receive sponsorship premiums from select TV programs, such as pay-per-view and shopping channels.

Social Media and Instant Messaging
 
We have firewalls in place both on the ground and in the air. These, in combination with our policy enforcement software, allow us to filter, classify, block, or forward services in accordance to our service and quality policies. We can control the flow of traffic for each individual application, enabling us to use a white list model through which social media and instant messaging partners can provide their users with onboard access by paying an annual fee.
 
We are in active discussions with Line, WeChat, WhatsApp, and other social media partners regarding an annual premium fee in exchange for user access to their applications and services during air travel. The access to other networks may be limited to a single direction or blocked entirely. For example, we could allow the users of a non-paying instant message service to receive, but not send, instant messages. When a user tries to respond to a received message, the system would present a pop-up message encouraging the user to urge the service provider to enter into a relationship with us.
 
Airlines can select movies, videos, and other content for their passengers through our content management system. The management system will tailor content suggestions according to the flight route and destination and automatically upload selected content to an onboard server while the aircraft is on the ground. This creates a cache that allows in-flight viewing in areas with limited or no satellite bandwidth connectivity. For premium content, we may maintain a live connection with the providers’ network for accounting and digital rights management purposes.
 
Video/Content on Demand
 
Content that is available to passengers for free will generate advertising-based revenue through commercials before and during the programming, as well as through banners advertisements. Passengers can choose to pay for premium content, such as first-run movies where available. For programming of all types, our partnered advertising agents can integrate appropriate and effective advertisements targeted to the viewer. Prior to the start of any program, users will be required to view a commercial with a length determined by the duration of the selected program. Passenger may not skip or close this commercial without closing out of the program. We can place similar advertisements before games or radio programs and during online duty-free shopping.
 
Frequent flying passengers will be able to purchase a premium package to allow access to unlimited movies, games, and other entertainment contents with no layered advertising. These packages will include day, trip, monthly, and annual based membership.
 
Search Engine
 
In this information age, people often refer to the Internet for information, yet few individuals are aware that every Internet search they perform generates revenue for the search engine company. Search engine providers, such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo, sell keywords, page ranking in search results, advertisement placement, and other related services. The revenue generated by a search engine fluctuates in relation to its volume of activity. We will manage search engines on a white list basis, which means that the in-flight connectivity system will only permit traffic to and from approved search engines to go through. If a passenger performs a search on a search engine that is not partnered with us, the search will be redirected to one that is.
 
We plan to enter into an agreement with search engine partners to share the revenue generated from passengers’ searches. As discussed under “Premium Content Sponsorship” above, we may grant exclusivity to a particular search engine provider that is a premium sponsor. Such exclusivity may be specific to certain airlines or routes.
 
Internet Advertising Replacement
 
We have invested millions of dollars in airborne satellite infrastructure in order to deliver Internet access to passengers. In the Internet traffic, more than 50% of bandwidth is consumed by advertisements in the data stream. In order to streamline bandwidth usage, our ground system will detect advertisements from a webpage and replaces them with advertisements from our advertisers or partners. We will work with Internet advertisers to present advertisements that are relevant to passengers’ interests. This system enables our partners to place their advertisements accordingly and generate revenue for both parties. These industry-leading advertisers offer destination-specific commercials and banners, which can be placed in the in-flight entertainment system and in apps and portal on personal devices. By utilizing these commercial agents to sell ad space on these systems, we plan to cover all marketable areas, expanding sales opportunities and increasing revenue.
 
With online advertisement utilizing both CPM and CPC models, we are able to capitalize on virtually all available ad space and work with any advertising partner.
 
Online/Streaming Gaming
 
We will make it possible to stream console-quality games in the cabin. Through gaming content partnerships, we will be able to offer PlayStation, Xbox, and other console games. Passengers will be able to play popular games from their personal device or in-flight entertainment system, invite friends to play over the network, and save their gaming data for continued play on the ground, which require high speed network in order to play those interactive action games. Our online gaming service will bring our passengers a gaming experience never seen before. We expect to generate revenue from advertisements, including banners and commercials, and from fees for premium games or sales of access passes.

Telecommunications Text Messaging Services
 
Through strategic partnerships with telecommunication providers, we will allow passengers to use 4G messaging services while in flight. Our in-flight system will detect whether the passenger is using a partner carrier’s network and will deliver or block messages to and from a passenger’s mobile phone accordingly. For those using a non-partner’s network, the system will urge the passenger to request that their service provider join our network. These passengers can also purchase a premium package to enable the text message service.
 
Destination-Based Service
 
With flight route and passenger information, our partners will be able to offer destination-specific merchandise and services, including hotel and rental car bookings, transportation arrangements, restaurant reservations, local tours, and ticket purchases. Travel insurance may be offered on the flight. By signing up with service partners in the region, we will share the transaction-based revenue by a fixed dollar amount or percentage of the transaction.
 
In-flight Trading
 
We have found that in-flight connectivity allows travelers to make better use of their travel time. With the uninterrupted broadband available onboard, passengers can conduct business with professionalism and ease. One example of this benefit is that we plan to collaborate with trading partners to offer financial trading services and charge a processing fee when a passenger conducts a trade in-flight.
Black Box Live
 
For reasons of flight safety, a flight recorder, commonly known as a black box, is required on every aircraft over a certain size. The flight recorder records data with respect to the various status of the flight and stores the data on a magnetic tape or solid-state disk with special coding. After retrieving the relevant information from the device, an individual can decode the data and learn what the aircraft encountered during the flight. This makes it possible to determine the potential causes of an accident. When the black box is needed, the aircraft has likely suffered an accident. A massive impact or explosion accompanies most airplane crashes, thus requiring the flight recorder to be shockproof and fire resistant. As the majority of aviation accidents happen over an ocean, the flight recorder must also be waterproof and corrosion-resistant to avoid being damaged by salt water. Despite advancements in flight recorder design and the continual improvement of the strength of its materials, records show that a large number of flight recorders were damaged and unreadable following accidents, if not lost altogether. For this reason, effective, real-time storage of in-flight data is beneficial for deducing the cause of aviation crashes and preventing them from happening again.
 
With this new product, Black Box Live, we expect to provide a system of real-time flight information back-up which is aimed at advancing flight safety. Under strict security measures, this new product will securely stream the flight data and crewmembers’ cockpit voice records to our cloud for airlines and authorized individuals to access and monitor. Black Box Live is in the early stages of development and, at this time, we cannot assure you when this product will reach market, if at all.
 
AirCinema
 
Our planned AirCinema solution is designed to transfer passengers’ visual and audio experience. Traditional built-in in-flight entertainment systems, in particular those in the economic cabin, are confined to very small screen and primitive audio sound. Our planned AirCinema utilizes the pico projector technology to bring supersized screen display onboard airplanes without incurring outrageous costs or adding significant weight. AirCinema will aim to deliver a screen size of up to 20” in economy seats and even bigger screen in business or first-class cabins. With such screen sizes, it will be possible for AirCinema to obtain IMAX certification. Moreover, AirCinema will be capable of providing full HD 3D Cinema experience in-flight. In addition, AirCinema will incorporate a special designed head rest with embedded speaker arrays that will deliver THX surround sound without headphones. We plan to qualify AirCinema for a theater license, which would enable us to provide first-run theater only movie titles and sell movie tickets on pay-per-view basis. Our satellite-based connectivity system could stream the movie title from ground to aircraft and simultaneously provide digital rights management, which is a prerequisite of showing a theater-only movie title. AirCinema will transform airline coach seating into theater seating and the passengers could enjoy movies with the same look and feel of sitting in a movie theater.
 
Aircom entered into a development agreement with Priceplay.com, Inc., or PPUS, a California corporation whose chairman is Daniel Shih, our co-founder, a former material beneficial owner of our common stock and the husband of our former director, Barbie Shih, for development of airplane passenger seats incorporating our AirCinema technology which we were to sell to PPUS and the delivery by PPUS to us of two prototype three-seat rows of seats for economy cabins. In March 2017, PPUS and Aircom mutually agreed to terminate the remainder of this contract due to changes in related technology and PPUS’ exit from this segment of the IFEC business. We will resume the development of this product upon the availability of certain new technology and additional funding. We cannot assure you at this time that we will be able to complete development of this new product offering. In settlement of the agreement with PPUS, we agreed to convert PPUS’ remaining prepayments to us of $737,000 into a subscription for 147,400 shares of our common stock. For a more detailed discussion of this settlement agreement, see “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence” below.

Yacht Communications 
 
We have begun to develop new equipment and services to provide satellite communications to yachts, initially in the East Asia market. Our new yachts service will utilize the same satellite communication infrastructure we have developed for IFEC. We are currently in the customer demonstration stage with our yacht satellite communications equipment and services. We cannot be sure at this time that we will be successful developing or marketing this yacht product offering.
Satellite Ground Stations and Data Centers
 
We plan to build a satellite ground station and a data center in Asia region to support our operations in that region.
 
A ground station’s main purpose is to establish telecommunication links with satellites.  It houses satellite antennae and other communication equipment.  Satellite antennae must be located within the coverage of the satellites being used.  Ground station satellite antennae are substantial in size, generally between 20 to 30 feet (7 to 9 meters) in diameter.  As we expand our operation, we expect to have multiple dish antennae connecting to various satellites.  Due to the strong electromagnetic radiation emitted by the antennae, a ground station must be located in rural or industrial areas and it requires a substantial setback zone around the ground station. 
 
Since our IFEC business model will require collecting and processing large amounts of data, it will be beneficial for us to have access to a high capacity data center for the storage and processing of big data.  Such a data center should be built within the same region of, and close to, the ground station, because of synergies and technical advantages such as shorter network latency and cost savings in ground links between the ground station and data center. We expect that building our own satellite ground stations and data centers will, in the long run, create economic efficiencies and operational independence. 
 
We are actively searching for appropriate sites for our first ground station and data center in the Asia region. 
 
Our Contracts with Airline Partners
 
In June 2016, we entered into a master agreement with Hong Kong Airlines Limited, a Hong Kong based airline, or Hong Kong Airlines, to install IFEC systems on-board their aircraft. Also party to this agreement is Klingon Aerospace Inc., formerly known as LUXE Electric Co., Ltd., a Taiwanese corporation, or Klingon, our product development partner and value-added reseller in the region where Hong Kong Airlines operates. Daniel Shih, our co-founder, was Chairman of Klingon from February 2015 to February 2016, and Peter Chiou, our former Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, was Chief Executive Officer and President of Klingon from March 2015 through April 2016, prior to his joining our company in February 2017.
 
The implementation of the Hong Kong Airlines project is conditioned upon VSTC approval from the HKCAD. We and our equipment supplier have submitted the VSTC application to HKCAD, but the application process is presently on hold due to the supplier’s failure to deliver a key component of the IFEC system. Presently, we do not expect the supplier to be able to delivery such key component. As a result, we are actively seeking alternative options to implement the Hong Kong Airline project, including developing necessary equipment or components thereof with other strategic partners. Because we cannot be sure when we will be able to obtain the IFEC equipment for the VSTC approval, we cannot be sure when we will begin to generate revenues from the agreement with Hong Kong Airlines, if at all.
 
Until such time as all approvals from the HKCAD have been received, our agreement with Hong Kong Airlines only expresses the parties’ desires and understandings and will not create any legal rights, liabilities or responsibilities whatsoever and will not be legally binding on us or Hong Kong Airlines. There can be no assurance as to when we will receive the required HKCAD approvals.
 
Additionally, we had expected that our services would be provided to Hong Kong Airlines through AsiaSat pursuant to the terms of our agreement with AsiaSat. Now that our agreement with AsiaSat has been terminated, we will have to find a replacement satellite services provider for our future arrangement with Hong Kong Airlines. We may not be able to find a replacement of AsiaSat on reasonable terms, if at all.

We plan to enter into business agreements with additional airline partners that will allow our satellite equipment and/or entertainment services to be installed, and our services provided, on their aircraft. Under these agreements, we expect that the airlines will commit to have our equipment installed on some or all of the aircraft they operate, and we will commit to provide passenger connectivity and/or entertainment services on such aircraft and to remit to the airlines a specified percentage of the revenue that we generate. We will have the exclusive right to provide Internet connectivity services on these aircraft throughout the term of the agreement in contracts with airline partners. Depending on the contract, installation and maintenance services may be performed by us and/or the airline. These agreements will also vary as to who pays for installation and maintenance of the equipment.

All of the above memorandums of understanding, or MOUs, and the Global Eagle LOI are nonbinding and as a result, they only express the desires and understandings between the parties and do not create any legally binding rights, obligations or contracts except for certain customary provisions such as exclusivity, costs and expenses, confidentiality and governing law. Any binding obligation to proceed with the transactions contemplated by the MOUs and the Global Eagle LOI would need to be included in a definitive agreement that is subject to negotiations of the parties, approvals by the board of directors of respective parties and in certain instances, approvals from regulatory authorities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such definitive agreements or receive the required governmental approvals. If for whatever reason the transactions contemplated by the MOUs and the Global Eagle LOI do not proceed, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
 
Product Development, Manufacturing, Installation and Maintenance 
 
On March 9, 2015, we entered into a 10-year purchase agreement with Klingon, pursuant to which we agreed to sell our in-flight connectivity systems to Klingon for joint development and resale to Hong Kong based airlines under the brand name Aircom4U. In accordance with the terms of this agreement, Klingon agreed to purchase from us an initial order of onboard equipment comprising an onboard system for a purchase price of $909,000, with payments to be made in accordance with a specific milestones schedule. To date, we have received $762,000 from Klingon in milestone payments towards the equipment purchase price.
 
Klingon may, at its option, purchase additional onboard system packages in connection with the marketing of the Aircom4U business. In furtherance of this arrangement, Klingon is a party to our agreement with Hong Kong Airlines. We expect Klingon to purchase additional onboard systems for resale to Hong Kong Airlines once our VSTC is approved by the HKCAD, although we can give no assurance as to when this will take place, if at all.
 
Because of the delay by our onboard system equipment supplier for the approval of the VSTC from the HKCAD, we have not been able to deliver to Klingon a ready for sale, certified onboard system equipment package. Instead, we have delivered to Klingon a development kit of the ordered equipment, which is the same as the finished product but for the lack of HKCAD certification. Although there is no specified deadline in the agreement with Klingon for delivering the certified onboard system, Klingon has the right to terminate its agreement upon 60 days’ prior notice, subject to a 60-day cure period, if we fail to timely deliver the certified product. If Klingon terminates its agreement, we may be responsible for refunding to Klingon the milestone payments that we have received. We will have to suspend or modify our agreement with Klingon if our current equipment supplier is not able to provide certifiable onboard system equipment package for the VSTC certification purpose.
 
We will provide airline partners with the equipment necessary for in-flight connectivity, which is to be installed by the MRO service provider selected by the airline. We will also provide training and technical support to each airline’s MRO for the installation of our equipment. Such support will also include technical, management, and operational support, with 24/7 network monitoring of the performance of each aircraft’s equipment.
 
We will rely on third-party suppliers for equipment components that we use to provide our services, including those discussed below.
 
We will purchase our ground station equipment from Blue Topaz Consultants, Ltd., a British Virgin Islands corporation, or BTC, under an agreement that we have with BTC dated December 15, 2015. Under the terms of this agreement, BTC will develop and provide to us four sets of ground station hub equipment, or the Hub Equipment, for our use and sale into our Asian markets. We and BTC will separately enter into service agreements for the installation and maintenance of the Hub Equipment systems. We have agreed to pay BTC $6,205,216 for the first Hub Equipment system and have already made milestone payments to BTC totaling $3,250,000. The purchase price was increased to $6,234,260 on November 30, 2016 due to the increase in cost of a software license. We will be required to pay BTC the balance of $2,984,260 owed on the first Hub Equipment system following delivery and service commencement of this system.
 
On January 15, 2015, we entered into a statement of work with dMobile for the development by dMobile of a next generation satellite-based data link system that can utilize advanced protocols such as WiMAX 2.1. According to the terms of this agreement, deliveries of work product were delivered to us over a scheduled period of time with the final delivery having been completed. The purchase price for this project was $4,950,000. We paid dMobile a non-refundable prepayment of $1,000,000. We and dMobile agreed to offset each other’s accounts receivable and accounts payable under this agreement and the agreement referred to under “—Our IFEC Solutions—Our Connectivity Solutions” above. After reconciliation of both accounts, we owed dMobile $471,100 which we agreed to settle through the issuance to dMobile of 94,220 shares of our common stock.

In January 2016, we entered into a purchase order, which we refer to as the Purchase Order, pursuant to which PPTW agreed to purchase from Aircom a set of mobile satellite communication equipment priced at $909,000. In March 2017, PPTW informed us that it desired to terminate its satellite communications related business and return the equipment that it purchased from us for a full refund. In settlement of this agreement, we agreed to accept a return of the equipment and to convert PPTW’s payment to us of $819,300 into a subscription for 163,860 shares of our common stock. For a more detailed discussion of this settlement agreement, see Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence” below.
 
Our Technology 
 
Dual-Band Hybrid Satellite System
 
We believe that mobile satellite broadband service requires the bandwidth efficiency provided by Ka band satellite and spot beam based HTS. However, limited Asia-Pacific coverage area of Ka HTS systems restrict the use of a pure Ka band system. Our design of dual Ka/Ku band satellite terminal allows independent acquisition of Ka and Ku band satellites at different orbital positions thus maximizing the utilization of satellite bandwidth.
Transcoding
 
The current mainstream video compression format is H.264, also known as MPEG-4 Advanced Video Coding. It is widely used in Blu-ray discs, online videos, web software, and HDTV broadcasts terrestrially and over cable and satellite.
 
H.265, also known as High Efficiency Video Coding, is a newly developed video compression standard designed to replace H.264. It is capable of delivering H.264 video quality at half the bit rate. H.265 has several significant advantages over H.264, including better compression, higher image quality, and lower bandwidth usage.
 
We incorporate hardware-based, real-time technology that transcodes content from multiple streaming or broadcast input forms. We convert the content into H.265-encoded Internet protocol, or IP, streams, which reduces the amount of bandwidth required while enhancing the quality of the content. By deploying real-time transcoding technology in its ground and airborne systems, we enable live TV and video streaming in an IP format that optimizes satellite bandwidth utilization and achieves cost-effective content delivery.
 
Satellite Link Acceleration
 
The most common transmission control protocols, or TCPs, used in the Internet have been designed for terrestrial wired networks. TCPs do not perform well in long-delay satellite environment and may cause bad user experiences in web surfing and Internet access.
 
Our satellite link acceleration technology improves TCP/IP-based data transmission over a satellite system through compression, deduplication, caching, latency optimization, packet aggregation, and cross-layer enhancement. This technology includes end-to-end software in airborne system and ground server for cost effective application accelerator and optimization of live TV and video streaming. This combination of technologies makes airborne Web access and contents access feel like fiber at home.
 
AirCinema
 
AirCinema incorporates projector-based H.265 steaming technology onboard an aircraft. We have optimized this projector system technology for in-flight viewing and entertainment purposes by utilizing auto focusing, zooming, and alignment, as well as dynamic brightness control. Passengers can use the AirCinema directional audio system to enjoy onboard music and content without the need for a separate headset.
 
Our Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as well as contractual restrictions to protect intellectual property and proprietary technology owned or used by us.
 
We have patented certain of our technologies in the United States, Europe, China and Taiwan. Our United States patents will expire at dates ranging from 2030 to 2031, while our patents outside of the United States expire at dates ranging from 2030 to 2031. We do not believe our business is dependent to any material extent on any single patent or group of patents that we own. We also have a number of patent applications pending both in and outside of the United States and we will continue to seek patent protection in the United States and certain other countries to the extent we believe such protection is appropriate and cost-effective.
 
We consider our brands to be important to the success of our business and our competitive position. We rely on both trademark registrations and common law protection for trademarks. Our registered trademarks in the United States and certain other countries include, among others, “AirCinema”, “AirTelecom”, “AircomPac” although we have not yet obtained registrations for our most important marks in all markets in which we currently do business or intend to do business in the future. Generally, the protection afforded for trademarks is perpetual, if they are renewed on a timely basis, if registered, and continue to be used properly as trademarks.

We license or purchase from third parties’ technology, software and hardware that are critical to providing our products and services. Much of this technology, software and hardware is customized for our use and would be difficult or time-consuming to obtain from alternative vendors.
 
We have developed certain ideas, processes, and methods that contribute to our success and competitive position that we consider to be trade secrets. We protect our trade secrets by keeping them confidential through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, vendors, and airline partners. Trade secrets can be protected for an indefinite period so long as their secrecy is maintained.
 
Our Competition 
 
Our key competitors include Gogo Inc., which has the largest installed base in the IFEC market mainly via air-to-ground technology and L-band connectivity services and provides a passenger-paid system of connectivity solutions and wireless in-flight entertainment services, and Panasonic Avionics Corp., which provides IFEC hardware and solutions via L-band and Ku-band technology. Other competitors include ViaSat, Global Eagle Entertainment, Inc., OnAir and Thales/LiveTV, all of which provide different technologies and strategies to provide in-flight connectivity and/or entertainment. Regardless of the delivery mechanisms used by us or our competitors, the IFEC industry as a whole faces, and is expected to continue to face, capacity constraints and unique technology challenges, which are expected to increase due to increased demand for in-flight Internet.
 
We believe that the following competitive strengths enable us to compete effectively in and capitalize on the growing IFEC market.
 

● | Unique business model. We believe that our business model sets us apart from our competitors. We combine cutting-edge connectivity technology with a unique content-driven approach. Traditionally, providers of in-flight connectivity focus primarily on the profit margin derived from the sale of hardware to airlines and of bandwidth to passengers. Both airlines and passengers have to “pay to play,” which results in low participation and usage rates. We break away from this model and set a new trend with our business model, under which neither airlines nor passengers need to pay for products or services. Furthermore, our business plan provides our airline partners with an opportunity to participate in our revenue sharing model. Taken together, this novel approach creates incentive for the airlines to work with us while driving up passenger usage rates.

● | Dual-band satellite technology. Most in-flight connectivity systems currently rely on the Ku-band satellite signals for communication, though many players in the market are working to provide higher bandwidth and faster transmitting rates using the Ka-band. However, there are few Ka-enabled satellites, which limits the coverage area in the Asia-Pacific region. Our dual band system architecture brings our airline partners and their passengers the benefits of both Ka- and Ku-band satellite technology. The Ka-band increases data throughput, while the Ku-band offers reliable service outside of the Ka-band coverage area or when Ka-band is not available due to weather or other interference.

Our Growth Strategy
 
We will strive to be a leading provider of IFEC solutions by pursuing the following growth strategies:
 

● | Increase number of connected aircraft. As of the date of this report, we have not provided our services on any commercial aircraft. However, we plan to rollout installation and provide our services in 2018. We plan to leverage our unique ability to cost-effectively equip each commercial aircraft type in an airline’s fleet to increase the number of equipped aircraft, targeting full-fleet availability of our services for our current and future airline partners. We continue to pursue this significant global growth opportunity by leveraging our broad and innovative technology platform and technical expertise. Further, we offer attractive business models to our airline partners, giving them the flexibility to determine the connectivity solution that meets the unique demands of their business. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase passenger use of connectivity. We believe that our business model, under which neither airlines nor passengers need to pay for products or services, will create an incentive for the airlines to work with us while driving passenger usage rates to levels management believes could reach 90% or more, considering the fact that many passengers now carry more than one smart device. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand satellite network. We will continue to expand our global satellite network coverage through the purchase of additional Ku-band and Ka-band capacity, and seek to install aircraft with our satellite solutions, while continuing to invest in research and development of satellite antenna and modem technologies. We are actively working with satellite providers in order to accommodate airlines’ global routes and growing fleets. We are monitoring the satellite industry for growth in coverage, with recent attention on China Satcom’s plan to launch high-capacity Ka-band and Ka HTS multispot-beam satellites over the Asia Pacific region. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand satellite-based services to other markets. We anticipate broadening our satellite-based services to high-speed railways, maritime and cruise lines, 4G/5G backhauling, and converged triple-play services in remote communities, with the potential to expand internationally into new markets. Future business prospects will be evaluated on a case by case basis by weighing the projected revenue from advertising fees and e-commerce revenue shares against the operating and capital expenditures of satellite coverage, bandwidth and operations. Our existing business model could be applied to high-speed railways and cruise lines, both of which have a sufficient passenger base for the service to be viable. High-speed railways in China that sit under our Ka satellite coverage area are not served by 4G/LTE mobile networks, providing us with a unique opportunity to deliver our services. High-speed railways in other regions of Asia present similar opportunities. Remote communities in Asia lack a telecom infrastructure, partly due to geographical limitations such as the many islands of the Philippines or Indonesia. Satellite-based communications and mesh network technology make triple play services possible, delivering live TV broadcasting, videos, and telecom services to these regions.

Regulation
 
As a participant in the global airline and global telecommunication industries we are subject to a variety of government regulatory obligations
 
Federal Aviation Administration
 
The FAA prescribes standards and certification requirements for the manufacturing of aircraft and aircraft components, and certifies and rates repair stations to perform aircraft maintenance, preventive maintenance and alterations, including the installation and maintenance of aircraft components. Each type of aircraft operated in the United States under an FAA-issued standard airworthiness certificate must possess an FAA Type Certificate, or TC, which constitutes approval of the design of the aircraft type based on applicable airworthiness standards. When a party other than the holder of the Type Certificate develops a major modification to an aircraft already type-certificated, that party must obtain an FAA-issued STC approving the design of the modified aircraft type. We will regularly obtain an STC for each aircraft type operated by each airline partner on whose aircraft our equipment will be installed and separate STCs typically are required for different configurations of the same aircraft type, such as when they are configured differently for different airlines.
 
After obtaining an STC, a manufacturer desiring to manufacture components to be used in the modification covered by the STC must apply to the FAA for a Parts Manufacturing Authority, or PMA, which permits the holder to manufacture and sell components manufactured in conformity with the PMA and its approved design and data package. In general, each initial PMA is an approval of a manufacturing or modification facility’s production quality control system. PMA supplements are obtained to authorize the manufacture of a particular part in accordance with the requirements of the pertinent PMA, including its production quality control system. We routinely apply for and receive such PMAs and supplements.
 
Our business depends on our continuing access to, or use of, these FAA certifications, authorizations and other approvals, and our employment of, or access to, FAA-certified individual engineering and other professionals.
 
In accordance with these certifications, authorizations and other approvals, the FAA requires that we maintain, review and document our quality assurance processes. The FAA may also visit our facilities at any time as part of our agreement for certification as a manufacturing facility and repair station to ensure that our facilities, procedures, and quality control systems meet FAA approvals we hold. In addition, we are responsible for informing the FAA of significant changes to our organization and operations, product failures or defects, and any changes to our operational facilities or FAA-approved quality control systems. Other FAA requirements include training procedures and drug and alcohol screening for safety-sensitive employees working at our facilities.
 
Foreign Aviation Regulation
 
According to international aviation convention, the airworthiness of FAA-certified equipment installed on U.S.-registered aircraft is recognized by civil aviation authorities, or CAAs, worldwide. As a result, we do not expect to require further airworthiness certification formalities in countries outside of the United States for U.S.-registered aircraft that already have an STC issued by the FAA covering our equipment. For aircraft registered with a CAA other than the United States, the installation of our equipment requires airworthiness certification from an airworthiness certification body. Typically, the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered is responsible for ensuring the airworthiness of any aircraft modifications under its authority.
 
The FAA holds bilateral agreements with a number of certification authorities around the globe. Bilateral agreements facilitate the reciprocal airworthiness certification of civil aeronautical products that are imported/exported between two signatory countries. A Bilateral Airworthiness Agreement, or BAA, or Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreement, or BASA, with Implementation Procedures for Airworthiness provides for airworthiness technical cooperation between the FAA and its counterpart civil aviation authorities. Under a BAA or BASA, the CAA of the aircraft’s country of registration generally validates STCs issued by the FAA and then issues a VSTC. For countries with which the FAA does not have a BAA or BASA, we must apply for certification approval with the CAA of the country in which the aircraft is registered. In order to obtain the necessary certification approval, we will be required to comply with the airworthiness regulations of the country in which the aircraft is registered. Failure to address all foreign airworthiness and aviation regulatory requirements at the commencement of each airline partner’s service in any country in which they register aircraft when there are no applicable bilateral agreements may lead to significant additional costs related to certification and could impact the timing of our ability to provide our service on our airline partners’ fleet.
 
Federal Communications Commission
 
Under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or the Communications Act, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, licenses the spectrum that we use and regulates the construction, operation, acquisition and sale of our wireless operations. The Communications Act and FCC rules also require the FCC’s prior approval of the assignment or transfer of control of an FCC license, or the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of more than 25% of the equity or voting control of our company by non-U.S. individuals or entities.

Our various services are regulated differently by the FCC. Our business may provide some of its voice and data services by reselling the telecommunications services of satellite operators. Because we may provide these services on a common carrier basis, we may subject to the provisions of Title II of the Communications Act, which require, among other things, that the charges and practices of common carriers be just, reasonable and non-discriminatory.
 
We provide broadband Internet access to commercial airlines and passengers. We plan to offer this service in the Asia-Pacific region and continental United States through our partner’s facilities, using satellite-based data delivery.
 
The FCC has classified mobile (and fixed) broadband Internet access services as Title II telecommunications services pursuant to the FCC Open Internet Order of 2010, or the Open Internet Order. The Open Internet Order also adopted broad new net neutrality rules. For example, broadband providers may not block access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices. Broadband providers also may not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services or non-harmful devices. In addition, broadband providers may not favor some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration of any kind, and they may not prioritize the content and services of their affiliates. Other than for paid prioritization, the rules contain an exception for “reasonable network management.” The Open Internet Order recognizes that whether a network management practice is reasonable varies according to the broadband technology involved, and provides more flexibility to implement network management practices in the context of our capacity-constrained satellite broadband networks.
 
In addition, most of our services are subject to various rules that seek to ensure that the services are accessible by persons with disabilities, including requirements related to the pass-through of closed captioning for certain IP-delivered video content.
 
Equipment Certification
 
We may not lease, sell, market or distribute any radio transmission equipment used in the provision of our services unless such equipment is certified by the FCC as compliant with the FCC’s technical rules. All certifications required for equipment currently used in the provision of our services have been obtained by our equipment vendors and/or partners.
 
Privacy and Data Security-Related Regulations
 
As noted above, the Open Internet Order reclassified mobile (and fixed) broadband Internet access services as Title II telecommunications services. Certain statutory provisions of Title II now apply to broadband Internet access services, including provisions that impose consumer privacy protections such as the FCC’s Consumer Proprietary Network Information, or CPNI, requirements.
 
Our services are also subject to CPNI rules that require carriers to comply with a range of marketing and privacy safeguards. These obligations focus on carriers’ access, use, storage and disclosure of CPNI. We believe we are in compliance with these rules and obligations, and we certify annually, as required, that we have established operating procedures adequate to ensure our compliance.
 
We are also subject to other federal and state consumer privacy and data security requirements. For example, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, Act prohibits “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” Although the FTC’s authority to regulate the non-common carrier services offered by communications common carriers has not been clearly delineated, FTC officials have publicly stated that they view the FTC as having jurisdiction over Internet service providers’ non-common carrier services. Some of our services are subject to the FTC’s jurisdiction. The FTC has brought enforcement actions under the FTC Act against companies that, inter alia: (1) collect, use, share, or retain personal information in a way that is inconsistent with the representations, commitments, and promises that they make in their privacy policies and other public statements; (2) have privacy policies that do not adequately inform consumers about the company’s actual practices; and (3) fail to reasonably protect the security, privacy and confidentiality of nonpublic consumer information.
 
We plan to collect personally identifiable information, such as name, address, e-mail address and credit card information, directly from our users when they register to use our service. We also may obtain information about our users from third parties. We use the information that we collect to, for example, consummate their purchase transaction, to customize and personalize advertising and content for our users and to enhance the entertainment options when using our service. Our collection and use of such information is intended to comply with our privacy policy, which is posted on our website, applicable law, our contractual obligations with third parties and industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We are also subject to state “mini-FTC Acts,” which also prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices, along with data security breach notification laws requiring entities holding certain personal data to provide notices in the event of a breach of the security of that data. Congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data breaches. A few states have also imposed specific data security obligations. These state mini-FTC Acts, data security breach notification laws, and data security obligations may not extend to all of our services and their applicability may be limited by various factors, such as whether an affected party is a resident of a particular state.
 
While we intend to implement reasonable administrative, physical and electronic security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personally identifiable information, cyber-attacks on companies have increased in frequency and potential impact in recent years and may be successful despite reasonable precautions and result in substantial potential liabilities.

Truth in Billing and Consumer Protection
 
The FCC’s Truth in Billing rules generally require full and fair disclosure of all charges on customer bills for telecommunications services, except for broadband Internet access services. Thus, these rules apply to our satellite-based services. This disclosure must include brief, clear and non-misleading plain language descriptions of the services provided. States also have the right to regulate wireless carriers’ billing; however, we are not currently aware of any states that impose billing requirements on our services.
CALEA
 
The FCC has determined that facilities-based broadband Internet access providers are subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994, or CALEA, which requires covered service providers to build certain law enforcement surveillance assistance capabilities into their communications networks and to maintain CALEA-related system security policies and procedures.
Foreign Government Approvals
 
In connection with our satellite service, we have implemented a process for obtaining any required authority needed to provide our service over the airspace of foreign countries, or verifying that no additional authorization is needed. Each country over which our equipped aircraft flies has the right to limit, regulate (e.g., through a licensing regime) or prohibit the offering of our service. We may not be able to obtain the necessary authority for every country over which a partner airline flies. For some countries, we have not been and do not expect to be able to obtain a definitive answer regarding their potential regulation of our service, and we may incur some regulatory risk by operating over the airspace of these countries. Failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements could result in penalties being imposed on us and/or on our airline partners or allow our airline partners affected by such requirements to terminate their contract with us prior to expiration. Moreover, even countries that have previously provided clearance for our service have the right to change their regulations at any time.
Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 19 employees, 15 of whom are full-time employees. The following table sets forth the number of our full-time employees by function.

Function | Number of Employees
---------------------------+--------------------
Operations | 4 
Sales and Marketing | 4 
Research and Development | 8 
General and Administrative | 3 
Total | 19 

Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:

● | have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);
● | submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay” and “say-on-frequency;” and 
● | disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation. 

 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.
 
We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
