ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “Lightbridge”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, and “us” refer to Lightbridge Corporation together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries Lightbridge International Holding LLC and Thorium Power Inc.
 
Company Overview
 
Lightbridge is a leading nuclear fuel technology company. Our primary focus is the development and commercialization of next generation nuclear fuel that will significantly improve the economics and safety of existing and new reactors, with a meaningful impact on addressing climate change and air pollution challenges. We believe our nuclear fuel technology has the potential to enhance reactor safety and the proliferation resistance of spent fuel and increase the power output of commercial reactors, reducing the cost of generating electricity and the amount of nuclear waste per unit of electricity generated.
 
We will conduct our business in 2018 principally through Enfission, LLC (“Enfission”), our 50/50 joint venture with Framatome, which was formed on January 24, 2018, for the development, regulatory licensing, fabrication, and sale of nuclear fuel assemblies based on Lightbridge-designed metallic fuel technology and other advanced nuclear fuel intellectual property. Enfission serves as our exclusive vehicle for the development of manufacturing processes and fuel assembly designs for pressurized water reactors and boiling water reactors, which collectively constitute most of the power reactors in the world, as well as water-cooled small modular reactors and water-cooled research reactors. In addition to our nuclear fuel technology segment, we also opportunistically provide nuclear power consulting and strategic advisory services to commercial and governmental entities worldwide. 
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 2, 1999. Our principal executive offices are located at 11710 Plaza America Drive, Suite 2000, Reston, Virginia 20190 USA.
 
Overview of Our Next Generation Nuclear Fuel
 
Since the founding of our company, we have been engaged in the design and development of proprietary, innovative nuclear fuels to improve the cost competitiveness, safety, proliferation resistance and performance of nuclear power generation. Since 2010 we have focused on the development of all-metal fuel (i.e., non-oxide fuel) for currently operating as well as new-build reactors. Our focus on metallic fuel is based on listening to the voices of prospective customers, as nuclear utilities have expressed interest in the improved economics and enhanced safety that metallic fuel can provide.
 
The fuel in a nuclear reactor generates heat energy. That heat is then converted through steam into electricity that is sold. We have designed our innovative, proprietary metallic fuels to be capable of significantly higher burnup and power density compared to conventional oxide fuels. Burnup is the total amount of electricity generated per unit mass of nuclear fuel and is a function of the power density of a nuclear fuel and the amount of time the fuel operates in the reactor. Power density is the amount of heat power generated per unit volume of nuclear fuel. Conventional oxide fuel used in existing commercial reactors is approaching the limits of its burnup and power density capability. As a result, further optimization to increase power output from the same core size and improve the economics and safety of nuclear power generation using conventional oxide fuel technologies is limited.
 
As the nuclear industry prepares to meet the increasing global demand for electricity production, longer operating cycles and higher reactor power outputs have become a much sought-after solution for the current and future reactor fleet. We believe our proprietary nuclear fuel designs have the potential to significantly enhance the nuclear power industry’s economics by:
 


· | providing an increase in power output of potentially up to 10% while simultaneously extending the operating cycle length from 18 to 24 months in existing pressurized water reactors (PWRs), including in Westinghouse-type four-loop PWR plants which are currently constrained to an 18-month operating cycle by oxide fuel, or increasing the power potentially up to 17% while retaining an 18-month operating cycle;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | enabling increased reactor power output via a power uprate (potentially up to 30% increase) or a longer operating cycle (instead of a power uprate) without changing the core size in new build PWRs; and 
· | reducing the volume of spent fuel per kilowatt-hour as well as enhancing proliferation resistance of spent fuel. 

 
We believe our fuel designs will allow current and new build nuclear reactors to safely increase power production and reduce operations and maintenance costs on a per kilowatt-hour basis. New build nuclear reactors could also benefit from the reduced upfront capital investment per kilowatt of generating capacity in case of implementing a power uprate. In addition to the projected electricity production cost savings, we believe that our technology can result in utilities or countries needing to deploy fewer new reactors to generate the same amount of electricity (in case of a power uprate), resulting in significant capital cost savings. For utilities or countries that already have operating reactors, our technology could be utilized to increase the power output of those reactors as opposed to building new reactors. Further, we believe that the fuel fabrication or manufacturing process for this new fuel design is simpler, which we expect could lower fuel fabrication costs.

Due to the significantly lower fuel operating temperature, our metallic nuclear fuel rods are also expected to provide major improvements to safety margins during off-normal events. US Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing processes require engineering analysis of a large break loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), as well as many other scenarios. The LOCA scenario assumes failure of a large water pipe in the reactor coolant system. Under LOCA conditions, the fuel and cladding temperatures rise due to reduced cooling capacity. Preliminary analytical modeling shows that under a design-basis LOCA scenario, unlike conventional uranium dioxide fuel, the cladding of the Lightbridge-designed metallic fuel rods would stay at least 200 degrees below the 850-900 degrees Celsius temperature at which steam begins to react with the zirconium cladding to generate hydrogen gas. Buildup of hydrogen gas in a nuclear power plant can lead to the hydrogen exploding. Lightbridge fuel is designed to prevent hydrogen gas generation in design-basis LOCA situations, which is a major safety benefit.
 
Enfission, LLC
 
In January 2018, we formed Enfission, LLC, a 50/50 joint venture with Framatome, Inc., to develop, license, manufacture, and sell nuclear fuel assemblies based on Lightbridge-designed metallic fuel technology and other advanced nuclear fuel intellectual property. Enfission serves as our exclusive vehicle for the development of manufacturing processes and fuel assembly designs for pressurized water reactors (PWRs), boiling water reactors (BWRs), water-cooled small modular reactors, and water-cooled research reactors. PWRs and BWRs constitute the most widely used reactor types in the world. In addition to distributions from Enfission based on our ownership interest in the joint venture, we anticipate receiving future licensing revenues in connection with sales by Enfission of nuclear fuel incorporating our intellectual property.
 
Framatome Inc. is a wholly-owned US subsidiary of Framatome, which we refer to individually or collectively in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, together with their affiliates, as Framatome. Framatome designs, manufactures and installs components and fuel for nuclear power plants and offers a full range of reactor services.
 
Anticipated Schedule for Development and Sale of Nuclear Fuel Assemblies
 
Set forth below is our anticipated schedule for Enfission’s development and sale of nuclear fuel assemblies. Please see Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a discussion of certain risks that may delay or impair the commercialization of nuclear fuel assemblies incorporating our nuclear fuel technology. Based on our current expectations, we anticipate that, either directly or through Enfission, we will:

· | develop a regulatory licensing plan for lead test assemblies and present it to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2018; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | enter into a lead test assembly agreement with a host reactor from 2019-2020; 
· | develop analytical models from 2018-2023 for our metallic fuel technology that can be used for reactor analysis and regulatory licensing; 
· | perform in-reactor and out-of-reactor experiments from 2020-2023; 
· | have semi-scale metallic fuel samples fabricated from 2019-2020 for irradiation testing in a test reactor environment under prototypic commercial reactor conditions; 
· | establish a pilot-scale fuel fabrication facility and demonstrate full-length fabrication of our metallic fuel rods from 2020-2023; and 
· | begin lead test assembly (LTA) operation in a full-size commercial light water reactor as soon as 2023-2024, which involves testing a limited number of full-scale fuel assemblies in the core of a commercial nuclear power plant over three 18-month cycles.


Accordingly, based on our current expected schedule, a purchase order for an initial reload batch placed by a utility is expected as soon as 2026-2027 (after two 18-month cycles of LTA operation), with final qualification (i.e., deployment of fuel in the first reload batch) in a commercial reactor expected as soon as 2028-2029. We intend to seek development funding contributions or other financing arrangements with utilities several years in advance of LTA demonstration.

Ownership and Management of Enfission
 
Lightbridge owns 50 percent of Enfission’s Class A voting membership units and Framatome owns the other 50 percent. Any distributions will be made based on the members’ pro rata ownership percentage. Lightbridge and Framatome each provided an initial capital contribution of $10,000, as well as licensed certain intellectual property to Enfission. Certain additional capital contributions made by Lightbridge and Framatome will partly be in the form of exclusive license rights to intellectual property developed pursuant to a research and development service agreement with Enfission.
 
Seth Grae, our Chief Executive Officer, also serves as Chief Executive Officer of Enfission. Enfission is managed by a board of directors composed of six directors, half of whom are appointed by Lightbridge and the other half are appointed by Framatome. The chairperson of Enfission’s board of directors alternates every year between directors appointed by Lightbridge and directors appointed by Framatome. The Enfission board acts by majority vote, provided that at least one director appointed by each of Lightbridge and Framatome votes in favor of the action. Certain major decisions require the approval of at least two-thirds of the directors, and certain fundamental decisions, including amending the Enfission operating agreement and issuing additional membership units, require the approval of two-thirds of the Class A members.
 
Agreements with Enfission and Framatome
 
Enfission has entered into several agreements with Lightbridge and Framatome relating to intellectual property, the provision of personnel and administrative support to Enfission, and research and development efforts.
 
Lightbridge and Framatome have also directly entered into binding agreements forming the foundation for Enfission, including the following agreements in November 2017 which govern joint research and development activities and the treatment of all related existing and future intellectual property:
 
 
· | R&D Services Agreement (“RDSA”) — The RDSA defines the terms and conditions for joint research and development activities between Framatome and Lightbridge. Enfission is a party to the RDSA. Key terms and conditions of the RDSA include: (i) designating a 17x17 fuel assembly as the first joint project of the parties and forming a steering committee for the project; (ii) establishing a framework for future work release orders relating to research and development activities of the parties; and (iii) granting rights to the use of background and foreground intellectual property needed to perform research and development activities. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Co-Ownership Agreement (“COA”) — The COA governs the co-ownership between Framatome and Lightbridge of the foreground information developed by and between Framatome and Lightbridge, with one another and through Enfission. The COA will survive the life of Enfission. The COA is limited to a domain consisting of the metallic fuel developed by Enfission for the following types of commercial light water reactors and research reactors: (i) pressurized water reactors, excluding water-cooled water-moderated energetic reactor (VVER) types, (ii) boiling water reactors, (iii) light water-cooled small and medium size reactors, and (iv) water-cooled research reactors. The domain expressly excludes maritime, naval and military applications.
· | Intellectual Property Annex (“IP Annex”) — The IP Annex is a higher-level reference document attached to the Enfission operating agreement and summarizes the parties’ understanding regarding intellectual property matters. The IP Annex will remain in force only during the life of the Enfission. 

   In connection with the RDSA, we currently anticipate purchasing via Enfission a minimum amount of research and development services from Framatome of approximately $3.3 million, for the period up through December 31, 2018. This amount is likely to increase over the course of the year.
 
Other Development of Our Nuclear Fuel Technology
 
We retain the right to commercialize our nuclear fuel technology outside of the domain encompassed by Enfission, most notably in VVERs and Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PSWRs), including Canada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactors. We anticipate all of our efforts for the foreseeable future will be directed towards Enfission.

Competition
 
To our knowledge, our nuclear fuel technology is the only technology that could be commercially viable to increase, in a safe and economically attractive way, power output potentially by up to 17% in existing PWRs and up to 30% in new build PWRs. Due to long product development timelines, significant nuclear regulatory requirements, and our intellectual property, we believe that the barriers to entry are very high for a competitor to our nuclear fuel technology segment.
 
Competition with respect to the design of commercially viable nuclear fuel products is limited to conventional uranium oxide fuels, which are reaching the limits in terms of their capability to provide increased power output or longer fuel cycles. We believe that the industry needs fuel products that can provide these benefits. While we believe conventional uranium oxide fuel may be capable of achieving power uprates of up to 10% in existing PWRs, doing so would require uranium-235 enrichment levels above 5% (as is also the case with our metallic fuel), higher reload batch sizes, or a combination thereof. The alternative route of increasing reload batch sizes while keeping uranium enrichment levels below 5% for power uprates up to 10% using conventional uranium oxide fuel raises the cost of each fuel reload, resulting in a significant fuel cycle cost penalty to the nuclear utility. The cost penalty could have a dramatic adverse impact on the economics of existing plants whose original capital cost has already been written off, which includes most US nuclear power plants.
 
Nuclear power faces competition from other sources of electricity, including natural gas, which is currently the cheapest option for power generation in the US and has resulted in some utilities abandoning nuclear power. Other sources of electricity may also be viewed as safer than nuclear power, although we believe that generating nuclear energy with Lightbridge fuel is the safest way to produce baseload electricity in suitable power reactors. To the extent demand for electricity generated by nuclear power decreases, the potential market for our nuclear fuel technology will decline.
 
Raw Materials
 
We do not plan to utilize any raw materials directly in the conduct of our operations. The fuel fabricators which will ultimately fabricate fuel products incorporating our nuclear fuel technology will require zirconium and uranium, and additional raw materials that are required for the production of nuclear fuel assemblies that go into the reactor core. Uranium and zirconium are available from various suppliers at market prices. Our plan is that utilities will contract with Enfission to order nuclear fuel assemblies, and Enfission will subcontract manufacturing of fuel assemblies to Framatome, which will physically produce and then ship the completed nuclear fuel assemblies to the reactor sites on behalf of Enfission.
Government Approvals and Relationships with Critical Development Partners/Vendors
 
The sales and marketing of our services and technology internationally may be subject to US export control regulations and the export control laws of other countries. Governmental authorizations may be required before we can export our services or technology or collaborate with foreign entities. If authorizations are required and not granted, our international business plans could be materially affected. Furthermore, the export authorization process is often time consuming. Violation of export control regulations could subject us to fines and other penalties, such as losing the ability to export for a period of years, which would limit our revenue growth opportunities and significantly hinder our attempts to expand our business internationally.
 
In 2015-2016, we received our export controls authorization from the US Department of Energy for all of our planned work outside the United States, specifically in France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, and Canada.
 
The testing, fabrication and use of nuclear fuels by Enfission and our future partners, licensees and nuclear power generators will be heavily regulated. The test facilities and other locations where our fuel designs may be tested before commercial use require governmental approvals from the host country’s nuclear regulatory authority. The responsibility for obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals will lie with our research and development contractors that conduct such tests and experiments. Nuclear fuel fabricators, which will ultimately fabricate fuel using our technology under commercial licenses from us, are similarly regulated. Utilities that operate nuclear power plants that may utilize the fuel produced by these fuel fabricators require specific licenses relating to possession and use of nuclear materials as well as numerous other governmental approvals for the ownership and operation of nuclear power plants.

Certain Challenges
 
The ability to fabricate the LTAs and a nuclear utility that is willing to accept the LTAs, is required for LTA demonstration in a commercial reactor. In the US, the fabricator and the utility will be primarily responsible for securing necessary regulatory licensing approvals for the LTA operation. To this end, in 2011, we established a Nuclear Utility Fuel Advisory Board (NUFAB) to further strengthen dialogue with global nuclear utilities. Separately, we formed Enfission with the fabricator Framatome to complete the development, demonstration, regulatory licensing, and commercial deployment of our metallic nuclear fuel in most types of reactors that are currently in operation, under construction, and planned around the world.

 
There is a lack of publicly available experimental data on our metallic fuel. We will need to conduct various irradiation experiments to confirm fuel performance under normal and off-normal events. Loop irradiation in a test reactor environment prototypic of commercial reactor operating conditions and other experiments on unirradiated and irradiated metallic fuel samples will be essential to demonstrate the performance and advantages of our metallic fuel. We are currently planning loop irradiation testing of our metallic fuel samples in a research reactor as part of this effort.

 
Existing analytical models may be inadequate. New analytical models, capable of accurately predicting the behavior of our metallic fuel during normal operation and off-normal events, may be required. Experimental data measured from our planned irradiation demonstrations will help to identify areas where new analytical models or modifications to existing ones may be required.

 
Demonstration of a fabrication process both for semi-scale irradiation fuel samples and subsequently for full-length (12-14 feet) metallic fuel rods for PWR LTAs is required. Past operating experience with differently shaped fuel rods with a similar metallic fuel composition involved fabrication of metallic fuel rods up to 3 feet in length in Russia. We have identified two suitable locations (one in France and one in the United States) for fabrication of test fuel samples up to 700mm in length for test reactor irradiation. Our current plan is for these fabricated test fuel samples to be irradiated to their target burnup in a pressurized water loop of the Halden Research Reactor located in Halden, Norway. We have identified multiple suitable locations for post-irradiation examination of the irradiated test fuel samples, including in Sweden, Canada or the United States. Once the test fuel samples have been manufactured, we plan to demonstrate fabrication of full-length fuel rods (12-14ft. in length) initially using depleted or natural uranium and subsequently utilize the same process to manufacture full-length fuel rods using high-assay low enriched uranium for lead test assemblies.
 
Overview of the Nuclear Power Industry
 
Presently, nuclear power provides approximately 7% of the world’s energy, including approximately 11% of the world’s electricity. According to the World Nuclear Association, as of February 1, 2018 there were approximately 448 operable nuclear power plants worldwide, mostly light water reactors, with the most common types being PWRs, boiling-water reactors (BWRs), and VVER reactors. Nuclear power provides a non-fossil fuel, low-carbon energy solution that can meet baseload electricity needs.
 
Due to substantial project risks and the significant upfront capital commitment associated with building new reactors, many nuclear utilities in deregulated markets choose to optimize their existing generating capacity through increasing their capacity utilization factor, power uprates and plant life extensions. We expect this trend to continue, particularly in the mature nuclear markets with significant existing nuclear capacity. We expect most of the new build activity to occur in emerging nuclear markets.
 
Of the world’s existing reactors currently in operation, PWRs (including Russian-designed VVERs) account for more than half of the net operating capacity, with BWRs being the second most prevalent and accounting for another 15-20%.
 
Of the nuclear reactors currently under construction, we estimate over 80% are either PWRs or VVERs with a rated electric power output of 1,000 megawatts (“MWe”) or greater.
 
Utilities have embraced power uprates as a cost-effective way to increase their generation capacity. While the efforts thus far have occurred mostly in the United States, we believe there is a large, untapped worldwide market for power uprates. The incentive to proceed with longer operating cycles and/or power uprates of up to 10% level is significant since there are few changes required to implement the power uprate, and the changes that are required are relatively inexpensive. The limiting factor at the moment is the fuel.

In some instances, utilities will modify and/or replace components in order to accommodate a higher power level. Technical analyses must demonstrate that the proposed plant configuration remains safe and that measures to protect the health and safety of the public continue to be effective. These analyses, which span many technical disciplines, are reviewed and approved by the regulator before a power uprate can be performed.
 
The utility will conduct an economic analysis to evaluate the potential financial benefits of the proposed uprate. Typically, power uprates enable utilities to increase their generating capacity at a cost significantly less than the cost of building a new plant. In many cases, power uprates can be completed in months as opposed to the several years required for new build, thus the invested dollars begin producing revenue shortly after they are spent. Power uprates, therefore, represent an efficient use of capital.
 
Most nuclear power plants originally had a licensed lifetime of 25 to 40 years, but engineering assessments have established that many can operate much longer. In the US, approximately 60 reactors have been granted license extensions to continue operating for a total of 60 years. Most of the plants that have not already requested a license extension are expected to apply in the near future. A license extension at about the 30-year mark requires additional capital expenditure for the replacement of worn equipment and outdated control systems. Multiple utilities have stated plans to apply to the NRC for additional 20 years of licensed lifetime, up to a total of 80 years per reactor.
 
The technical and economic feasibility of replacing major reactor components, such as steam generators in PWRs, has been demonstrated. The increased revenue generated from extending the lifetime of existing plants is attractive to utilities, especially in view of the difficulties in obtaining public acceptance of constructing replacement nuclear capacity.
 
Almost all of the new build reactor designs are either Generation III or Generation III+ type reactors. The primary difference from second-generation designs is that many incorporate passive or inherent safety features which require no active controls or operational intervention to avoid accidents in the event of malfunction. Many of these passive systems rely on gravity, natural convection, or resistance to high temperatures.
 
Influence of the Accident at Fukushima, Japan and New International Nuclear Build
 
The nuclear accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan following the strong earthquake and massive tsunami that occurred on March 11, 2011 increased public opposition to nuclear power, resulting in a slowdown in, or, in some cases, a complete halt to, new construction of nuclear power plants and an early shut down of existing power plants in certain countries. As a result, some countries that were considering launching new domestic nuclear power programs before the Fukushima accident have delayed or cancelled preparatory activities they were planning to undertake as part of such programs. This has diminished the number of consulting opportunities that we could compete for globally, at least in the near-term. In addition, the Fukushima accident appears to have shrunk the projected size of the global nuclear power market in 2025-2030 as reflected in the most recent reference case projections published by the World Nuclear Association. At the same time, the event has brought a greater emphasis on safety to the forefront that may be beneficial to us because our metallic fuel provides improved safety and fuel performance during normal operation and design-basis accidents.
Our Intellectual Property
 
Our nuclear fuel technologies are protected by multiple US and international patents. Set forth below are the patents which we consider material to our business based on our current plans, all of which we have licensed to Enfission:

  We also own a number of US and international patents associated with fuel assembly designs for all-uranium seed and blanket fuel for existing plants and new build reactors and thorium-based seed and blanket fuel for both existing and new build reactors, which we do not consider material, individually or collectively, based on our current business plan. In addition to our patent portfolio, we also own trademarks to Lightbridge and Thorium Power corporate names and the Lightbridge logo.
 
We are continually executing a strategy aimed at further expanding our intellectual property portfolio. We spent approximately $2.3 million and $2.7 million for research and development during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Our Consulting Business
 
In addition to our nuclear fuel technology business, we also opportunistically provide nuclear power consulting and strategic advisory services to commercial and governmental entities worldwide. Our consulting segment is primarily engaged in the business of assisting commercial and governmental entities globally with developing and expanding their nuclear industry capabilities and infrastructure. We can provide integrated strategic advice across a range of expertise areas including, for example, regulatory development, nuclear reactor site selection, procurement and deployment, reactor and fuel technology, international relations, program management and infrastructure development.

We only engage with commercial entities and governments that are dedicated to non-proliferative and transparent nuclear programs.
 
Our consulting services are expert and relationship based, with particular emphasis on key decision makers in senior positions within governments or companies, as well as focus on overall management of nuclear energy programs. To date, nearly all of our revenues have been derived from our consulting and strategic advisory services business segment, which primarily provided nuclear consulting services to entities within the United Arab Emirates, our first significant consulting and strategic advisory client. We have also provided nuclear safety consulting advice to US nuclear utilities and others. We currently do not have any consulting contracts.
 
In general, the market for nuclear industry consulting services is competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid change. Some of our competitors are global in scope and have greater personnel, financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. Domestic and international political pressure and public opposition to nuclear power may hinder our efforts to provide nuclear energy consulting services. We believe that our independence, experience, expertise, reputation and segment focus enable us to compete effectively as a strategic advisor for governments wishing to develop a new civil nuclear program.
 
Our major challenge in pursuing our business is that the decision-making process for nuclear power programs typically involves careful consideration by many parties and therefore requires significant time. Many of the potential clients that could benefit from our services are in regions of the world where tensions surrounding nuclear energy are high, or in countries where public opinion plays an important role.
 
Financial information about our nuclear fuel technology and consulting segments is incorporated by reference from Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Employees
 
Our business model is to limit the number of our full-time employees and to rely on individual independent contractors, outside agencies and technical facilities with specific skills to assist with various business functions including, but not limited to, corporate overhead, personnel, research and development, and government relations. This model limits overhead costs and allows us to draw upon resources that are specifically tailored to our internal and external (client) needs. As of December 31, 2017, we had six full-time employees and one part-time employee. We utilize a network of independent contractors available for deployment for specialized consulting assignments. We believe that our relationship with our employees and contractors is satisfactory.
