Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
Except where the context otherwise requires, all references in this Annual Report to the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our” or similar words or phrases are to One Madison Corporation, a Cayman Islands exempted company. References to our “management” or our “management team” refer to our executive officers and directors, and references to the “sponsor” refer to One Madison Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in which our founder, Omar M. Asali, together with certain affiliates, holds a controlling 80% ownership interest. References to our “initial shareholders” refer to the sponsor, the anchor investors (as defined below), the BSOF Entities (as defined below) and the Company’s management.
 
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on July 13, 2017 as a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have reviewed, and continue to review, opportunities to enter into a business combination, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete a business combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target business. We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
 
On January 22, 2018, we consummated our initial public offering (the “initial public offering”) of 30,000,000 units (the “units”). Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds, before expenses, of $300 million. Prior to the consummation of the initial public offering, the Sponsor purchased 8,625,000 Class B ordinary shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share, and certain other investors (the “anchor investors”) purchased 3,750,000 Class B ordinary shares for an aggregate purchase price of $37,500, or approximately $0.01 per share (together, the “founder shares”). The founder shares were issued to the anchor investors in connection with their agreement to purchase an aggregate of 15,000,000 ordinary shares (13,025,000 Class A ordinary shares and 1,975,000 Class C ordinary shares) (“forward purchase shares”), plus an aggregate of 5,000,000 redeemable warrants (“forward purchase warrants”) for $10.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $150 million, in a private placement to occur concurrently with the closing of the initial business combination (the “forward purchase agreements”). We also entered into the strategic partnership agreement (the “Strategic Partnership Agreement), pursuant to which the sponsor transferred 525,000 founder shares to BSOF Master Fund L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, and BSOF Master Fund II L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, both affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (together, the “BSOF Entities”). On March 8, 2018, the Sponsor surrendered 1,125,000 Class B ordinary shares to the Company for no consideration, which the Company cancelled, following the expiration of the underwriters’ over-allotment option granted in the initial public offering.
 
Upon execution of the forward purchase agreements, each anchor investor elected to receive a fixed number of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares. The Class C ordinary shares have identical terms as the Class A ordinary shares, except the Class C ordinary shares do not grant their holders any voting rights. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, following the consummation of our initial business combination, the Class C ordinary shares may be converted into Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis (i) at the election of the holder with 65 days’ written notice or (ii) upon the transfer of such Class C ordinary share to an unaffiliated third party.
 
Pursuant to the Strategic Partnership Agreement, the BSOF Entities have agreed to act as our strategic partner and may provide debt or equity financing in connection with our initial business combination, but are not required to do so. The founder shares held by the BSOF Entities are subject to certain transfer restrictions, forfeiture and earnout provisions similar to those imposed upon our sponsor and the anchor investors. If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, the BSOF Entities have agreed to vote any founder shares they may own in favor of such initial business combination. The BSOF Entities may designate one observer to our board of directors until the consummation of our initial business combination. The BSOF Entities have also separately purchased an aggregate of 560,000 private placement warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, in the Initial Private Placement. Such private placement warrants have the same terms and conditions as those purchased by our anchor investors. The BSOF Entities will be entitled to registration rights with respect any ordinary shares and warrants held by them. We believe that the combination of capital provided by our anchor investors and a strategic partnership with the BSOF Entities will provide us with a material advantage in effecting an initial business combination.

Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, the Company consummated the private placement (“Initial Private Placement”) of 8,000,000 warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”) each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share or Class C ordinary share, as applicable, at $11.50 per share, at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $8 million.
 
Upon the closing of the initial public offering and the Initial Private Placement, $300 million ($10.00 per unit) from the net proceeds thereof was placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee (“Trust Account”), and is invested in a money market fund selected by the Company until the earlier of: (i) the completion of the initial business combination or (ii) the redemption of the Company’s public shares if the Company is unable to complete a business combination by January 22, 2020, subject to applicable law.
 
After the payment of underwriting discounts and commissions (excluding the deferred portion of $10,500,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions, which amount will be payable upon consummation of our initial business combination if consummated) and approximately $1,000,000 in expenses relating to the initial public offering, approximately $1,000,000 of the net proceeds of the initial public offering and Initial Private Placement was not deposited into the Trust Account and was retained by us for working capital purposes. The net proceeds deposited into the Trust Account remain on deposit in the Trust Account earning interest.
 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following our initial public offering. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash held in the Trust Account, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination
 
While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or location, we intend to focus on the consumer sector and consumer-related businesses based predominantly in North America with global reach. We believe our management team has the skills and experience to identify, evaluate and consummate a business combination and is positioned to assist businesses we acquire in the following categories: (i) consumer products or services, (ii) food and beverage and (iii) adjacent manufacturing or industrial services businesses linked to a consumer end-user. We intend to target businesses that have stable cash flows, strong management teams, and attractive growth prospects over the long term. Our management and our operating and advisory committee have extensive experience not only identifying and executing the acquisition of private and public companies, but also the running and operating of businesses post-transaction.

Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.
 
The time required to evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Redemption rights for holders of public shares upon consummation of our initial business combination
 
We will provide our shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares sold as part of the units sold in the initial public offering (the “public shares”) upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest, less income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, and with respect to the initial shareholders other than the anchor investors, any public shares they may hold in connection with the consummation of the initial business combination.

Conduct of redemptions pursuant to tender offer rules
 
If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
 
Submission of our initial business combination to a shareholder vote
 
In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after the initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, and with respect to the initial shareholders other than the anchor investors, any public shares they may hold in connection with the consummation of the business combination.
 
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, other than as expressly stated herein, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
 
The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.

Limitation on redemption rights upon completion of our initial business combination if we seek stockholder approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the initial public offering. We believe the restriction described above will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the shares sold in the initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem to no more than 20% of the shares sold in the initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those shareholders that hold more than 20% of the shares sold in the initial public offering) for or against our business combination.
 
Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination
 
The sponsor, the anchor investors, our management and the BSOF Entities have agreed that we will have until January 22, 2020 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by January 22, 2020, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by January 22, 2020.
 
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have three executive officers and no other employees. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in.
