  Introduction and General Background
  
 Command Center, Inc. ("Command Center,” the “Company,” “CCI,” “we,” "us," or “our”) is a staffing company, operating primarily in the manual on-demand labor segment of the staffing industry. In 2017, we employed approximately 33,000 workers providing services to approximately 3,200 customers, primarily in the areas of light industrial, auto and transportation, hospitality and event services. Our customers range in size from small businesses to large corporate enterprises. All of our temporary staff, which we refer to as field team members, are employed by us. Most of our work assignments are short-term and many are filled on little advanced notice from our customers. In addition to short and longer-term temporary work assignments, we sometimes recruit and place workers in temp-to-hire positions.
  
 As of March 28, 2018, we owned and operated 67 on-demand labor locations, or branches, across 23 states. We currently operate as Command Center, Inc. Prior to 2017, we also operated through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Disaster Recovery Services, Inc., which ceased corporate existence in April 2016. All financial information is consolidated and reported in our consolidated financial statements. Our corporate headquarters is in Lakewood, Colorado.
  
 In prior years we were organized as Command Staffing, LLC. We were organized in December 2002 and commenced operations in 2003 as a franchisor of on-demand labor businesses. In November 2005, Temporary Financial Services, Inc., a public company, acquired the assets of Command Staffing, LLC and Harborview Software, Inc., an affiliated company that owned the software used in the operation of our on-demand labor branches. The transaction was accounted for as if Command Staffing, LLC was the accounting acquirer, and our name changed to Command Center, Inc.
  
  Industry Overview
  
 The on-demand labor industry has developed based on the business need for flexible staffing solutions. Many businesses operate in a cyclical production environment and find it difficult to staff according to their changing production cycles. Companies also desire a way to temporarily replace full-time employees when absent due to illness, vacation, or unplanned termination. On-demand labor offers customers the opportunity to immediately respond to changes in staffing needs, reduce the costs associated with recruiting and interviewing, eliminate unemployment and workers’ compensation exposure, and draw from a larger pool of potential employees.

 The on-demand labor industry continues to develop specialized market segments that reflect the diverse needs of the businesses it serves. Technical skills, prior work history, duration of assignment, and drug and background check requirements vary among industries and employers. We operate primarily within the short-term, semi-skilled and unskilled segments of the on-demand labor industry. We endeavor to customize our services according to the unique opportunities and assets presented by each of our branches, while leveraging our overall size. This approach reduces our overhead costs, improves economies of scale, establishes procedural uniformity and internal controls, and creates a predictable internal environment for our field team members.
  
  Business
  
  Strategic Growth Opportunities:  We continue to build our network of on-demand labor branches. We supply a quality workforce and we strive to consistently match the right field team members with the right jobs. We have 67 locally-managed branches throughout the United States that serve as trusted partners to businesses and job seekers alike. Customers, representing a variety of industries, trust us to learn their business and to plan ahead to address their dynamic staffing needs. Job seekers trust us to understand their complete employment picture and place them in on-demand, temporary, temp-to-hire, or permanent placement positions where they can grow, thrive, and provide immediate value. The total number of branches open and operating increased from 64 at the end of fiscal year 2016 to 66 at the end of fiscal year 2017 as we expanded our operations while continuing to improve our business fundamentals. In 2018, we plan to continue our strategy of carefully balancing branch expansion against return on investment. In doing so, we expect to concentrate our revenue growth efforts primarily on sales growth within our existing branch structure, while opening new branches in areas that present exceptional opportunities, and looking for acquisitions that will expand our existing operational footprint. In all of our growth opportunities, we continue to emphasize the fundamentals of our business: sell to quality accounts, increase margins where possible, and provide exceptional customer service.
  
  On-demand Labor Branch Operations:  In 2017, we continued to focus on the basics of our business: consistency and excellence in service, increasing margins, containment of costs, selling techniques, and company culture. We concentrated on these measures to improve profitability and solidify the groundwork for future growth.
  
 During the year, we employed approximately 33,000 field team members and serviced approximately 3,200 customers. Our branches are located across 23 states. Our branches are often located in proximity to concentrated commercial and industrial areas typically with access to public transportation and other services that are important to our field team members. We have developed a branch demographic model to identify and qualify potential future locations.
  
 Our field operations are managed by in-branch personnel, area managers, and corporate management. Where appropriate, business development specialists are employed to help drive business to our branches. Our compensation plans for branch managers, area managers, and business development specialists are designed to secure and retain the qualified personnel needed to meet our business, financial, and growth objectives. Our personnel practices are designed to attract, screen, hire, train, support, and retain qualified personnel at all levels of our organization. We propagate best practices from our higher performing branches across all operating groups to produce consistent execution and improvements in company-wide performance.
  
  Our Temporary Staff, or Field Team Members:  Field team members are our product and our key asset. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract, train, motivate, and reward our field team members. We have invested in many programs designed to create a long-term relationship with top-performing field team members. These programs include health insurance, bonus programs, safety rewards, longevity programs, training programs, and career services.
  
 The pool of qualified and available field team members varies by location. For most of our branches, the supply of field team members is sufficient and diverse enough to meet current customer needs. However, in some locations, field team member availability is a limiting factor. We continue to seek additional field team members through internet postings, newspaper advertisements, printed flyers, branch displays, career fairs, and word-of-mouth.

  Our Customers:  In 2017, we serviced approximately 3,200 customers across a variety of industries. Our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 23% of our revenue in 2017. Additionally, at December 29, 2017, 11.8% of total accounts receivable was due from a single customer. The top six industries we served were retail, construction, warehousing, industrial/manufacturing, transportation, and hospitality. In 2016, we serviced approximately 3,200 customers in a variety of industries. Our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 24% of our revenue in 2016. The top six industries we served were retail, construction, warehousing, industrial/manufacturing, transportation, and hospitality.
  
  Our Marketing Strategy:  We find that our customers are too busy to have time consumed by a traditional sales person. Rather, they are looking for smart solutions to their current challenges. Our unique sales process starts by learning about customers and facilitating conversations where we offer support and contribute to a growing relationship. Together, we create an action plan that draws on our core competencies and solves our customer's needs. Once we have resolved one need, we consistently strive to meet additional needs. Many of our existing customers are served by multiple branches, across multiple cities, and in many cases, across multiple states. We have tailored programs to specifically address the needs of these national accounts and plan to continue our efforts to expand our national accounts in the years ahead.
  
  Our Workers’ Compensation Coverage:  In accordance with state laws, we provide our workforce with workers’ compensation insurance. Currently, we are covered under a large deductible policy with ACE American Insurance Company, or ACE, where we have primary responsibility for claims under the policy. Under our current policy, which has been in place since April 1, 2014, we are responsible for covered losses and expenses up to $500,000 per incident. Amounts in excess of $500,000 are the responsibility of ACE. From April 1, 2012 through March 31, 2014, we were covered under a large deductible policy issued by Dallas National Insurance, who changed their name to Freestone Insurance Company, or Freestone, in 2014. Under the prior policy, we are responsible for covered losses and expenses up to $350,000 per incident. Amounts in excess of $350,000 are the responsibility of Freestone.
  
 For workers’ compensation claims originating in Washington and North Dakota, we pay workers’ compensation insurance premiums and obtain full coverage under mandatory state administered programs. Our liability associated with claims in these states is limited to our premium payments.
  
  Our Safety Program:  To protect our workforce and help control workers’ compensation insurance rates, we maintain several company-wide safety programs designed to increase awareness of safety issues. We provide safety training through videos, safety testing, and basic and remedial instruction. Branch managers conduct periodic job site safety inspections on new and existing jobs to ensure that our field team members are working in a safe environment. We encourage safe work behavior through an incentive program that rewards our field team members for working accident free by allowing them to purchase safety and other items by using earned points. We also encourage our field team members to report unsafe working conditions. Branch managers also learn risk management and proper safety protocols when attending training sessions at our corporate office. We regularly evaluate the risk profile of the work we undertake on an ongoing basis, and sometimes restrict classes of work in order to manage risk appropriately.
  
  Our Seasonality:  Some of the industries in which we operate are subject to seasonal fluctuation. Many of the jobs filled by field team members are outdoor jobs that are generally performed during the warmer months of the year. As a result, activity increases in the spring and continues at higher levels through summer, then begins to taper off during fall and through winter. Seasonal fluctuations are typically less in the more temperate parts of the United States, where many of our branches are located. Fluctuations in seasonal business affect financial performance from period to period. Severe weather in any of our locations for prolonged periods has the potential to impair our business within these geographies, given the outdoor nature of many of our assignments.
  
  Our Competition:  The manual labor sector of the on-demand labor industry in which we operate is largely fragmented and highly competitive, with low barriers to entry. Our competitors range in size from small, local or regional operators with five or fewer locations to large, multi-national operations with hundreds of locations.
  
 The primary competitive factors in our market segment include price, the ability to timely provide the requested workers, and overall quality of service. Secondary factors include worker quality and performance, efficiency, the ability to meet the business-to-business vendor requirements, name recognition, established reputation, and customer relationships. While barriers to entry are low, businesses operating in this sector of the on-demand labor industry do require access to significant working capital, particularly in the spring and summer when seasonal staffing requirements are highest. Lack of working capital can be a significant impediment to growth for small, local, and regional on-demand labor providers. In addition, the growth in government regulation is also creating a barrier to entry as many smaller firms cannot profitably comply with the administrative burden of the new regulations.

  Our Intellectual Property:  We have proprietary software systems in place to handle most aspects of our operations, including field team member dispatch activities, invoicing, accounts receivable, and payroll.

We are the employer of record for our field team members, and as such, are responsible for collecting withholding taxes and for paying employer contributions for social security, unemployment tax, workers’ compensation, other insurance programs, and all other governmental requirements imposed on employers. In addition to completing Form I-9 required by the Department of Homeland Security, we also verify the identity and work eligibility of each new employee through the federal E-Verify system.
