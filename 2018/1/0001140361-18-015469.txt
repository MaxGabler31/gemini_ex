ITEM 1. | Business
--------+---------

Company Overview
 
DXP was incorporated in Texas in 1996 to be the successor to SEPCO Industries, Inc., founded in 1908. Since our predecessor company was founded, we have primarily been engaged in the business of distributing maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products, equipment and service to energy and industrial customers. The Company is organized into three business segments: Service Centers, Supply Chain Services and Innovative Pumping Solutions. Sales, operating income, and other financial information for 2015, 2016 and 2017, and identifiable assets at the close of such years for our business segments are presented in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements “financial statements” in Item 8 of this Report.
 
Our total sales have increased from $125 million in 1996 to $1.0 billion in 2017 through a combination of internal growth and business acquisitions. At December 31, 2017 we operated from 176 locations in thirty-four states in the U.S., nine provinces in Canada, Dubai and one state in Mexico, serving more than 50,000 customers engaged in a variety of industrial end markets. We have grown sales and profitability by adding additional products, services, locations and becoming customer driven experts in maintenance, repair and operating solutions.
 
Our principal executive office is located at 7272 Pinemont Houston, Texas 77040, and our telephone number is (713) 996-4700. Our website address on the Internet is www.dxpe.com and emails may be sent to info@dxpe.com. The reference to our website address does not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the website and such information should not be considered part of this Report.
 
Industry Overview
 
The industrial distribution market is highly fragmented. Based on 2016 sales as reported by Industrial Distribution magazine, we were the 19th largest distributor of MRO products in the United States. Most industrial customers currently purchase their industrial supplies through numerous local distribution and supply companies. These distributors generally provide the customer with repair and maintenance services, technical support and application expertise with respect to one product category. Products typically are purchased by the distributor for resale directly from the manufacturer and warehoused at distribution facilities of the distributor until sold to the customer. The customer also typically will purchase an amount of product inventory for its near term anticipated needs and store those products at its industrial site until the products are used.
 
We believe that the distribution system for industrial products, as described in the preceding paragraph, creates inefficiencies at both the customer and the distributor levels through excess inventory requirements and duplicative cost structures. To compete more effectively, our customers and other users of MRO products are seeking ways to enhance efficiencies and lower MRO product and procurement costs. In response to this customer desire, three primary trends have emerged in the industrial supply industry:
 
 
· | Industry Consolidation. Industrial customers have reduced the number of supplier relationships they maintain to lower total purchasing costs, improve inventory management, assure consistently high levels of customer service and enhance purchasing power. This focus on fewer suppliers has led to consolidation within the fragmented industrial distribution industry.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Customized Integrated Service. As industrial customers focus on their core manufacturing or other production competencies, they increasingly demand customized integration services, consisting of value-added traditional distribution, supply chain services, modular equipment and repair and maintenance services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Single Source, First-Tier Distribution. As industrial customers continue to address cost containment, there is a trend toward reducing the number of suppliers and eliminating multiple tiers of distribution. Therefore, to lower overall costs to the customer, some MRO product distributors are expanding their product coverage to eliminate second-tier distributors and become a “one stop source”.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe we have increased our competitive advantage through our traditional fabrication of integrated system pump packages and integrated supply programs, which are designed to address our customers’ specific product and procurement needs. We offer our customers various options for the integration of their supply needs, ranging from serving as a single source of supply for all our specific lines of products and product categories to offering a fully integrated supply package in which we assume procurement and management functions, which can include ownership of inventory, at the customer's location. Our approach to integrated supply allows us to design a program that best fits the needs of the customer. Customers purchasing large quantities of product are able to outsource all or most of those needs to us. For customers with smaller supply needs, we are able to combine our traditional distribution capabilities with our broad product categories and advanced ordering systems to allow the customer to engage in one-stop sourcing without the commitment required under an integrated supply contract.
 
Business Segments
 
The Company is organized into three business segments: Service Centers (“SC”), Supply Chain Services (“SCS”) and Innovative Pumping Solutions (“IPS”). Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives and provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within our businesses. The following table sets forth DXP’s sales recognition by business segments as of December 31, 2017.  See Results of Operations under Item 7, “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further information on our segments’ financial results.

Segment | 2017 Sales (in thousands) | % of Sales | End-Markets | Locations | Employees
--------+---------------------------+------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------
SC | $ 641,275 | 63.7 % | Oil & Gas, Food & Beverage, General Industrial, Chemical & Petrochemical, Transportation | 161 service centers 4 distribution centers | 1,463 
SCS | $ 161,477 | 16.0 % | Oil & Gas Food & Beverage, Mining & Transportation | 67 customer facilities | 271 
IPS | $ 204,030 | 20.3 % | Oil & Gas Mining Utilities | 11 fabrication facilities | 555 

Service Centers
 
The Service Centers are engaged in providing MRO products, equipment and integrated services, including technical expertise and logistics capabilities, to energy and industrial customers with the ability to provide same day delivery. We offer our customers a single source of supply on an efficient and competitive basis by being a first-tier distributor that can purchase products directly from manufacturers. As a first-tier distributor, we are able to reduce our customers' costs and improve efficiencies in the supply chain. We offer a wide range of industrial MRO products, equipment and integrated services through a continuum of customized and efficient MRO solutions. We also provide services such as field safety supervision, in-house and field repair and predictive maintenance.
 
A majority of our Service Center segment sales are derived from customer purchase orders for products. Sales are directly solicited from customers by our sales force. DXP Service Centers are stocked and staffed with knowledgeable sales associates and backed by a centralized customer service team of experienced industry professionals. At December 31, 2017, our Service Centers’ products and services were distributed from 161 service centers and 4 distribution centers.

DXP Service Centers provide a wide range of MRO products in the rotating equipment, bearing, power transmission, hose, fluid power, metal working, industrial supply and safety product and service categories. We currently serve as a first-tier distributor of more than 1,000,000 items of which more than 60,000 are stock keeping units (SKUs) for use primarily by customers engaged in the oil and gas, food and beverage, petrochemical, transportation and other general industrial industries. Other industries served by our Service Centers include mining, construction, chemical, municipal, agriculture and pulp and paper.
 
The Service Centers segment’s long-lived assets are located in the United States, Canada, Dubai and Mexico. Approximately 12.5% of the Service Centers segment’s revenues were in Canada and the remainder was virtually all in the U.S. Our foreign operations are subject to certain unique risks, which are more fully disclosed in Item 1A “Risk Factors,” “Risks Associated with Conducting Business in Foreign Countries.”
 
At December 31, 2017, the Service Centers segment had approximately 1,463 employees, all of whom were full-time.
 
Supply Chain Services
 
DXP’s Supply Chain Services (SCS) segment manages all or part of its customers’ supply chains, including procurement and inventory management. The SCS segment enters into long-term contracts with its customers that can be cancelled on little or no notice under certain circumstances. The SCS segment provides fully outsourced MRO solutions for sourcing MRO products including, but not limited to, the following: inventory optimization and management; store room management; transaction consolidation and control; vendor oversight and procurement cost optimization; productivity improvement services; and customized reporting. Our mission is to help our customers become more competitive by reducing their indirect material costs and order cycle time by increasing productivity and by creating enterprise-wide inventory and procurement visibility and control.
 
DXP has developed assessment tools and master plan templates aimed at taking cost out of supply chain processes, streamlining operations and boosting productivity. This multi-faceted approach allows us to manage the entire MRO products channel for maximum efficiency and optimal control, which ultimately provides our customers with a low-cost solution.
 
DXP takes a consultative approach to determine the strengths and opportunities for improvement within a customer’s MRO products supply chain. This assessment determines if and how we can best streamline operations, drive value within the procurement process, and increase control in storeroom management.
 
Decades of supply chain inventory management experience and comprehensive research, as well as a thorough understanding of our customers’ businesses and industries have allowed us to design standardized programs that are flexible enough to be fully adaptable to address our customers’ unique MRO products supply chain challenges. These standardized programs include:
 
 
· | SmartAgreement, a planned, pro-active MRO products procurement solution for MRO categories leveraging DXP’s local Service Centers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | SmartBuy, DXP’s on-site or centralized MRO procurement solution.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | SmartSourceSM, DXP’s on-site procurement and storeroom management by DXP personnel.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | SmartStore, DXP’s customized e-Catalog solution.
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | SmartVend, DXP’s industrial dispensing solution, which allows for inventory-level optimization, user accountability and item usage reduction by an initial 20-40%.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | SmartServ, DXP’s integrated service pump solution. It provides a more efficient way to manage the entire life cycle of pumping systems and rotating equipment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



DXP’s SmartSolutions programs listed above help customers to cut product costs, improve supply chain efficiencies and obtain expert technical support. DXP represents manufacturers of up to 90% of all the maintenance, repair and operating products of our customers. Unlike many other distributors who buy products from second-tier sources, DXP takes customers to the source of the products they need.

Innovative Pumping Solutions
 
DXP’s Innovative Pumping Solutions® (IPS) segment provides integrated, custom pump skid packages, pump remanufacturing and manufactures branded private label pumps to meet the capital equipment needs of our global customer base. Our IPS segment provides a single source for engineering, systems design and fabrication for unique customer specifications.
 
Our sales of integrated pump packages, remanufactured pumps or branded private label pumps are generally derived from customer purchase orders containing the customers’ unique specifications. Sales are directly solicited from customers by our dedicated sales force.
 
DXP’s engineering staff can design a complete custom pump package to meet our customers’ project specifications. Drafting programs such as Solidworks® and AutoCAD® allow our engineering team to verify the design and layout of packages with our customers prior to the start of fabrication. Finite Elemental Analysis programs such as Cosmos Professional® are used to design the package to meet all normal and future loads and forces. This process helps maximize the pump packages’ life and minimizes any impact to the environment.
 
With over 100 years of fabrication experience, DXP has acquired the technical expertise to ensure that our pumps and pump packages are built to meet the highest standards. DXP utilizes manufacturer authorized equipment and manufacturer certified personnel. Pump packages require MRO products and original equipment manufacturers’ (OEM) equipment such as pumps, motors, valves, and consumable products, such as welding supplies. DXP leverages its MRO product inventories and breadth of authorized products to lower the total cost and maintain the quality of our pump packages.

We acquire our products through numerous OEMs. We are authorized to distribute certain manufacturers' products only in specific geographic areas. All of our oral or written distribution authorizations are subject to cancellation by the manufacturer, some upon little or no notice. For the last three fiscal years, no manufacturer provided products that accounted for 10% or more of our revenues.
 
Over 90% of our business relates to sales of products. Service revenues are less than 10% of sales.
 
The Company has operations in the United States of America, Canada, Dubai, and Mexico. Information regarding financial data by geographic areas is set forth in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Recent Acquisitions
 
A key component of our growth strategy includes effecting acquisitions of businesses with complementary or desirable product lines, locations or customers. Since 2004, we have completed 34 acquisitions across our three business segments. Below is a summary of recent acquisitions since the beginning of 2013.
 
On April 16, 2013, DXP acquired all of the stock of National Process Equipment Inc. (“NatPro”) through its wholly owned subsidiary, DXP Canada Enterprises Ltd. DXP acquired this business to expand DXP’s geographic presence in Canada and strengthen DXP’s pump, integrated system packaging and related equipment offering. The $40.1 million purchase price was financed with $36.6 million of borrowings under our then-existing credit facility and 52,542 shares of DXP common stock. Additionally, the purchase agreement included an earn-out provision, which stated that former owners of NatPro may earn CDN $6.0 million based on achievement of an earnings target during the first year of DXP’s ownership. The fair value of the earn-out recorded at the acquisition date was $2.8 million. As of December 31, 2013 the $2.8 million accrued liability associated with this earn-out provision was reversed and included in 2013 operating income. See Note 8 of the financial statements regarding the 2014 impairment of NatPro assets.
 
On May 17, 2013, DXP acquired substantially all of the assets of Tucker Tool Company, Inc. (“Tucker Tool”). DXP acquired this business to expand DXP's geographic presence in the northern U.S. and strengthen DXP's industrial cutting tools offering. DXP paid approximately $5.0 million for Tucker Tool which was borrowed under our then-existing credit facility.
 
On July 1, 2013, DXP acquired all of the stock of Alaska Pump & Supply, Inc. (APS). DXP acquired this business to expand DXP's geographic presence in Alaska. DXP paid approximately $13.0 million for APS which was borrowed under our then-existing credit facility.
 
On July 31, 2013, DXP acquired substantially all of the assets of Tool-Tech Industrial Machine & Supply, Inc. (“Tool-Tech”). DXP acquired this business to enhance our metal working product offering in the southwest region of the United States. DXP paid approximately $7.2 million for Tool-Tech which was borrowed under our then-existing credit facility.
 
On January 2, 2014, the Company acquired all of the equity securities and units of B27, LLC (“B27”). DXP acquired this business to expand DXP’s pump packaging offering. The total transaction value was approximately $304.9 million, including working capital payments and excluding approximately $1.0 million in transaction costs. The purchase price was financed with borrowings under our then-existing credit facility and approximately $4.0 million (36,000 shares) of DXP common stock. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the 2014 and 2015 impairments of B27 goodwill. After the acquisition of B27, there was a working capital dispute between the Company and the sellers. During the third quarter of 2015, an accounting expert issued his report on the working capital dispute between DXP and the sellers of B27. The report required DXP to pay the sellers of B27 an additional $11.3 million. Because the time period to allow adjustments of purchase accounting had expired, $7.3 million of the payment was expensed. The remaining $4.0 million of the required payment represented tax refunds, which the Company collected as of the end of 2016.

On May 1, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the equity interests of Machinery Tooling and Supply, LLC (MT&S) to expand DXP’s cutting tools offering in the North Central region of the United States. DXP paid approximately $14.7 million for MT&S, which was borrowed under our then-existing credit facility.
 On April 1, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the equity interests of Tool Supply, Inc. (“TSI”) to expand DXP’s cutting tools offering in the Northwest region of the United States. DXP paid approximately $5.0 million for TSI, which was borrowed under our then-existing credit Facility.
 
On September 1, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the equity interests of Cortech Engineering, LLC (“Cortech”) to expand DXP’s rotating equipment offering to the Western seaboard. DXP paid approximately $14.9 million for Cortech. The purchase was financed with borrowings under our then-existing credit facility as well as $4.4 million (148.8 thousand shares) of DXP common stock.
 
On January 1, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Application Specialties, Inc. (“ASI”), a distributor of cutting tools, abrasives, coolants and machine shop supplies. DXP paid approximately $11.5 million for ASI. The purchase was financed with $10.6 million of cash on hand as well as issuing $0.9 million of DXP’s common stock.
 
Disposition
 
On October 3, 2016, the Company sold Vertex Corporate Holdings, Inc. for approximately $31 million in cash. The sale is a non-core business divestiture for DXP, and the proceeds were primarily used to pay down debt obligations.
Competition
 
Our business is highly competitive. In the Service Centers segment we compete with a variety of industrial supply distributors, some of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do. Some of our competitors are small enterprises selling to customers in a limited geographic area. We also compete with catalog distributors, large warehouse stores and, to a lesser extent, manufacturers. While many of our competitors offer traditional distribution of some of the product groupings that we offer, we are not aware of any major competitor that offers on a non-catalog basis a variety of products and services as broad as our offerings. Further, while certain catalog distributors provide product offerings as broad as ours, these competitors do not offer the product application, technical expertise and after-the-sale services that we provide. In the Supply Chain Services segment we compete with larger distributors that provide integrated supply programs and outsourcing services, some of which might be able to supply their products in a more efficient and cost-effective manner than we can provide. In the Innovative Pumping Solutions segment we compete against a variety of manufacturers, distributors and fabricators, many of which may have greater financial and other resources than we do. We generally compete on expertise, responsiveness and price in all of our segments.
Insurance
 
We maintain liability and other insurance that we believe to be customary and generally consistent with industry practice. We retain a portion of the risk for medical claims, general liability, worker’s compensation and property losses. The various deductibles of our insurance policies generally do not exceed $250,000 per occurrence. There are also certain risks for which we do not maintain insurance. There can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate for the risks involved, that coverage limits will not be exceeded or that such insurance will apply to all liabilities. The occurrence of an adverse claim in excess of the coverage limits that we maintain could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The premiums for insurance have decreased over the past three years in connection with the decline in revenues, payroll and vehicles since 2014. This trend would be expected to reverse with an increase in revenues. Additionally, we are partially self-insured for our group health plan, worker’s compensation, auto liability and general liability insurance. The cost of claims for the group health plan has increased over the past three years. This trend is expected to continue.

Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to our business and operations, and various health and safety regulations including those established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Canadian Occupational Health and Safety.
 
Certain of our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations as well as provincial regulations controlling the discharge of materials into or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.
 
Although we believe that we have adequate procedures to comply with applicable discharge and other environmental laws, such laws and regulations could result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances into the environment or costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. In some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. New laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new laws can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined.
 
The risks of accidental contamination or injury from the discharge of controlled or hazardous materials and chemicals cannot be eliminated completely. In the event of such a discharge, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any such liability could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
We are not currently aware of any situation or condition that we believe is likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
