ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
History

General Cannabis Corp, a Colorado corporation, was incorporated on June 3, 2013. Our predecessor company, Promap Corporation (Promap), a Colorado corporation, was incorporated on November 12, 1987. Promap previously operated an oil and gas mapping business, and most of its sales were to a company controlled by its former chief executive officer. On August 14, 2013, Promap acquired 94% of the issued and outstanding shares of Advanced Cannabis Solutions, Inc. (ACSI), a private Colorado corporation, in exchange for 12,400,000 shares of its common stock. Following the acquisition, our core business became the provision of sophisticated services and solutions to the regulated cannabis industry throughout the United States.

On November 9, 2013, Promap acquired the remaining 6% of the share capital of ACSI. On October 1, 2013, Promap changed its name from Promap Corporation to Advanced Cannabis Solutions, Inc. On December 31, 2013, the oil and gas mapping business was sold to our former chief executive officer in consideration of his agreement to assume all liabilities associated with such business. On June 17, 2015, we changed our name from Advanced Cannabis Solutions, Inc. to General Cannabis Corp.
 
On March 26, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Iron Protection Group, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, doing business as Iron Protection Group or IPG. In May 2015, we relaunched our consulting business under the tradename Next Big Crop (NBC) by hiring individuals with expertise in the cannabis consulting industry. On September 25, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Chiefton Supply Co., a Colorado corporation, doing business as Chiefton. In August 2017, we acquired the operating assets of Mile High Protection Group, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, which will continue to do business as Mile High Protection Services, or Mile High. Mile High has a diversified client roster, providing security services to hospitality companies, such as hotels, and to licensed cannabis retailers and cultivators in Colorado.

Our stock currently is quoted under the symbol CANN (OTCQB).

Corporate Structure

We operate through our five wholly-owned subsidiaries: (a) ACS Colorado Corp., a Colorado corporation incorporated in 2013; (b) Advanced Cannabis Solutions Corporation, a Colorado corporation incorporated in 2013; (c) 6565 E. Evans Owner LLC, a Colorado limited liability company formed in 2014; (d) General Cannabis Capital Corporation, a Colorado corporation incorporated in 2015; and (e) GC Security LLC, a Colorado limited liability company formed in 2015. Advanced Cannabis Solutions Corporation has one wholly-owned subsidiary company, ACS Corp., a Colorado corporation, incorporated in 2013.
Our Products, Services and Customers

We operate in a rapidly evolving and highly regulated industry that, as has been estimated by some, will exceed $30 billion in revenue by the year 2020. We have been and will continue to be aggressive in executing acquisitions and pursuing other opportunities that we believe will benefit us in the long-term.

Through our reporting segments (Security, Marketing, Operations and Finance), we provide products and services to the regulated cannabis industry, which include the following:

Security and Cash Transportation Services (Security Segment)

We provide advanced security, including on-site professionals and cash transport, to licensed cannabis cultivators and retail shops, under the business name IPG, and security services to non-cannabis customers in the hospitality business, such as hotels, under the business name Mile High Protection Services (MHPS). The drop in wholesale prices in Colorado has negatively impacted security services in Colorado, as grow facilities and retailers seek cheaper alternatives or curtail services. We acquired Mile High in order to expand our Colorado security business into the non-cannabis space, as we believe that market provides an opportunity for growth. We have opened an IPG office in California, which recently legalized recreational cannabis in addition to previously legal medical marijuana.

In states that have recently legalized cannabis, whether medical, recreational or both, license applications require a security plan and, if approved, implementation of that security plan. Accordingly, we are assessing the opportunity to expand our security consulting business to assist companies with their application process and the subsequent implementation of compliant security services.

Marketing Consulting and Apparel (Marketing Segment)

Chieftons apparel business, Chiefton Supply, strives to create innovative, unique t-shirts, hats, hoodies and accessories. Our apparel is sold through our on-line shop, cannabis retailers, and specialty t-shirt and gift shops. We are pursuing relationships with national apparel retailers and distributors, as well as expanding our offerings nationwide within the cannabis industry.

Chiefton Design provides design, branding and marketing strategy consulting services to the cannabis industry. We assist clients in developing a comprehensive marketing strategy, as well as designing and sourcing client-specific apparel and products. We now have the capacity of a full service marketing agency. Chiefton Design also supports our other segments with marketing designs and apparel.
 
Operations Consulting and Products (Operations Segment)

Through Next Big Crop (NBC), we deliver comprehensive consulting services to the cannabis industry that include obtaining licenses, compliance, cultivation, retail operations, logistical support, facility design and construction, and expansion of existing operations. Our business plan for NBC correlates to future growth of the regulated cannabis market in the United States.

NBC oversees our wholesale equipment and supply business, operated under the name GC Supply, which provides turnkey sourcing and stocking services to cultivation, retail and infused products manufacturing facilities. Our products include infrastructure, equipment, consumables and compliance packaging.

Finance and Real Estate (Finance Segment)

Real Estate Leasing

Until December 29, 2017, we owned a cultivation property in a suburb of Pueblo, Colorado, consisting of approximately three acres of land, which currently includes a 5,000 square foot steel building and a parking lot. The property is zoned for cultivating cannabis and is leased to a medical cannabis grower until December 31, 2022. On December 19, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to sell this property for $625,000 in cash, which closed on December 29, 2017.

Our real estate leasing business plan includes the potential future acquisition and leasing of cultivation space and related facilities to licensed marijuana growers and dispensary owners for their operations. Management anticipates that these facilities would range in size from 5,000 to 50,000 square feet. These facilities would only be leased to tenants that possess the requisite state licenses to operate cultivation facilities. The leases with the tenants would include certain requirements that permit us to continually evaluate our tenants compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Shared Office Space, Networking and Event Services  

In October 2014, we purchased a former retail bank located at 6565 East Evans Avenue, Denver, Colorado 80224, which has been branded as The Greenhouse. The building is a 16,056 square foot facility, which we use as our corporate headquarters.

The Greenhouse has approximately 10,000 square feet of existing office space and 5,000 square feet on its ground floor that is dedicated to a consumer banking design. We continue to assess the opportunity to lease shared workspace for entrepreneurs, professionals and others serving the cannabis industry. Clients would be able to lease office, meeting, lecture, educational and networking space, and individual workstations. We expect to continue the renovation of The Greenhouse in 2018.

We plan to continue to acquire commercial real estate and lease office space to participants in the cannabis industry. These participants may include media, internet, packaging, lighting, cultivation supplies and financial services-related companies. In exchange for certain services that may be provided to these tenants, we expect to receive rental income in the form of cash. In certain cases, we may acquire equity interests or provide debt capital to these businesses.

Industry Finance

Our industry finance strategy includes evaluating opportunities to make direct term loans or to provide revolving lines of credit to businesses involved in the cultivation and sale of cannabis and related products. These loans would generally be secured to the maximum extent permitted by law. We believe there is a significant demand for this type of financing. We are assessing other finance services including customized finance, capital formation and banking, for participants in the cannabis industry.
Desert Created Company LLC / DB Products Arizona, LLC

In January 2018, we entered into a limited liability company operating agreement with DNFC LLC (DNFC), pursuant to the formation of Desert Created Company LLC (Desert Created Company). Each party owns a 50% interest in Desert Created Company, the successor company to DB Arizona. Desert Created Company is the successor entity to DB Products Arizona, LLC (DB Arizona).

5

DB Arizona produced and distributed cannabis-infused elixirs and edible products in Arizona. We loaned $26,500 and $75,000, respectively, to DB Arizona during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. In June 2017, we purchased 100% of the ownership interests in GC Finance Arizona LLC (GC Finance Arizona) from Infinity Capital for $106,000 in cash. GC Finance Arizona holds a 50% ownership interest in DB Arizona, an $825,000 loan to DB Arizona, and no liabilities. We expected future positive cash flows, if any, would first go towards paying the holders of DB Arizonas notes payable. Accordingly, we allocated the entire consideration of $106,000 to the note receivable from DB Arizona. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, DB Arizona ceased operations and we impaired the full amount of our notes receivable from DB Arizona.

Competitive Strengths

We believe we possess certain competitive strengths and advantages in the industries in which we operate:

Range of Services. We are able to leverage our breadth of services and resources to deliver comprehensive, integrated solutions to companies in the cannabis industryfrom operational, compliance and marketing consulting, to products, security and financing services.
Strategic Alliances. We are dedicated to growing through strategic acquisitions, partnerships and agreements that will enable us to enter and expand into new markets. Our strategy is to pursue alliances with potential targets that have the ability to generate positive cash flow, effectively meet customer needs and supply desirable products, services or technologies, among other considerations. We anticipate that strategic alliances will play a significant role as more states pass legislation permitting the cultivation and sale of hemp and cannabis.
Regulatory Compliance. The state laws regulating the cannabis industry are changing at a rapid pace. Currently, there are 29 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico that have adopted legislation to manage the medical cannabis industry. Eight of those states also allow recreational use, and a ninth will allow it as of July 1, 2018. In the state of Colorado, where we draw almost all of our revenue, cannabis is heavily regulated. Ensuring that all aspects of our operations are in compliance with all state and local laws, policies, guidance and regulations to which we are subject and providing an opportunity to our customers and allies to use our services in order to ensure that they, too, are in full compliance are both critical components of our business plan.
Industry Knowledge. We continue to create, share and leverage information and experiences with the purpose of creating awareness and identifying opportunities to increase shareholder value. Our management team has business expertise, extensive knowledge of the cannabis industry and closely monitors changes in legislation. We work with partners who enhance the breadth of our industry knowledge.
Lending Capabilities. In February 2014, the Treasury Department issued guidelines for financial institutions dealing with cannabis-related businesses, (see BusinessGovernment and Industry RegulationFinCEN). Nevertheless, many banks and traditional financial institutions refuse to provide financial services to cannabis-related businesses. We plan to provide finance and leasing solutions to market participants using the FinCEN guidelines as a primary guide for compliance with federal law.
Market Conditions

Our target markets are those where states have legalized the production and use of cannabis. Historically, the majority of our revenues have come from the state of Colorado. In Colorado, the cannabis market was expanded in January 2014 to permit recreational use. Generally, this means adults over the age of twenty-one, including visitors from other states, can purchase cannabis from licensed retailers, subject to certain daily limits. According to published reports, Colorados cannabis industry reported estimated wholesale and retail sales during calendar years 2017 and 2016 of $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.

In January 2018, Vermont legalized recreational cannabis use, joining Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, bringing the total number of states with legalized recreational cannabis use to nine, in addition to the District of Columbia.

As of December 31, 2017, 29 states, the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico have legalized the use of cannabis for medical use in some form. It may take multiple years for a state to establish regulations and for cannabis businesses to begin generating revenue from operations, so the impact of new states legalizing the medical use of cannabis may begin to be realized in 2018 and 2019.

Continued development of the regulated cannabis industry depends on continued legislative authorization at the state level. Progress, while encouraging, is not assured and any number of factors could slow or halt progress in the cannabis industry.

Competition

Overall, we believe we have a competitive advantage by providing a range of goods and services to the cannabis industry. This allows us to provide integrated solutions to our customers, as well as sell additional goods and services to customers of a single segment. There is no aspect of our business, however, that is protected by patents or copyrights. As a result, our competitors could duplicate our business model with little effort.
Security and Cash Transportation Services. IPG faces competition from national security and cash transportation firms, as well as local agencies that provide general or cannabis-specific security services. We endeavor to establish a competitive advantage through our hiring practices, training and supervision to ensure we provide qualified, reliable service. The market for these services, however, is driven primarily by pricing.
Marketing Consulting and Apparel. Our apparel line competes with local and national cannabis-oriented clothing sellers, as well as non-cannabis-related clothing. Our marketing services compete with local and national marketing agencies, which may or may not have a focus in the cannabis industry.
Operations Consulting and Products. There are a limited number of competitors that provide the full range of services that NBC delivers. However, each individual service we provide has competition from experts in individual, specific fields. For example, attorneys may assist with license procurement and compliance. There are numerous firms that specialize in traditional greenhouse and cultivation consulting, as well as companies that provide operations services. As the cannabis industry grows, these competitors may develop further expertise and expand their focus on the cannabis industry.
Finance and Real Estate. In February 2014, the Treasury Department issued guidelines for financial institutions dealing with cannabis-related businesses, (see Government and Industry RegulationFinCEN). Many banks and traditional financial institutions refuse to provide financial services to cannabis-related business. We plan to provide finance and leasing solutions to market participants using the FinCEN guidelines as a primary guide for compliance with federal law. However, with the growth of the cannabis industry, there has been growth in alternative financing and banking resources. Many of these alternative sources have more capital and resources than we have.
Government and Industry Regulation

Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession and/or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the DOJ) describes Schedule I controlled substances as the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence. If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA in Colorado with respect to state-regulated cannabis activities in Colorado and other states, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.

Notwithstanding the CSA, as of the date of this Report, 29 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Guam and Puerto Rico allow their residents to use medical cannabis. Voters in the states of Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington have approved ballot measures, and the state legislature of Vermont has approved legislation, to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use. Such state and territorial laws are in conflict with the federal CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal at the federal level.

In light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. For example, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration, James M. Cole, issued a memorandum (the Cole Memo) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) provided guidelines (the FinCEN Guidelines) on February 14, 2014, regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) obligations (see  FinCEN).

Additional existing and pending legislation provides, or seeks to provide, protection to persons acting in violation of federal law but in compliance with state laws regarding cannabis. The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment (formerly known as the Rohrbacher-Farr Amendment) to the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, which funds the DOJ, since 2014 has prohibited the DOJ from using funds to prevent states with laws authorizing the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical cannabis from implementing such laws. On August 2016, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in United States v. McIntosh that the Amendment bars the DOJ from spending funds on the prosecution of conduct that is allowed by state medical cannabis laws, provided that such conduct is in strict compliance with applicable state law. The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment is currently effective through March 23, 2018, but as an amendment to an appropriations bill, it must be renewed annually.

7

These developments previously were met with a certain amount of optimism in the cannabis industry, but (i) neither the CARERS Act nor the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2017 have yet been adopted, (ii) the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, being an amendment to an appropriations bill that must be renewed annually, has not currently been renewed beyond March 23, 2018, and (iii) the ruling in United States v. McIntosh is only applicable precedent in the Ninth Circuit, which does not include Colorado, the state where we currently primarily operate.

Furthermore, on January 4, 2018, the U.S. Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, issued a memorandum for all U.S. Attorneys (the Sessions Memo) stating that the Cole Memo was rescinded effectively immediately. In particular, Mr. Sessions stated that prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions, which require federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. The Sessions Memo went on to state that given the DOJs well-established general principles, previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately.

In response to the Sessions Memo, U.S. Attorney Bob Troy for the District of Colorado, the state in which our principal business operations are presently located, issued a statement on January 4, 2018, stating that the United States Attorneys Office in Colorado is already guided by the well-established principles referenced in the Sessions Memo, focusing in particular on identifying and prosecuting those who create the greatest safety threats to our communities around the state. We will, consistent with the Attorney Generals latest guidance, continue to take this approach in all of our work with our law enforcement partners throughout Colorado.

It is unclear at this time whether the Sessions Memo indicates that the Trump administration will strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement. However, a significant change in the federal governments enforcement policy with respect to current federal laws applicable to cannabis could cause significant financial damage to us. We do not currently cultivate, distribute or sell cannabis, but hold a 50% non-operated ownership in an entity that does, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement policies of the federal government depending on the nature of such change. As of the date of this Report, we have provided products and services to state-approved cannabis cultivators and dispensary facilities. As a result, we could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities, a violation of federal law.

The Cole Memo

Because of the discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from federal law that prohibits any such activities, DOJ Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued the Cole Memo concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA.

At the time of its issuance, the Cole Memo reiterated Congresss determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of cannabis is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo noted that the DOJ was committed to enforcement of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also noted that the DOJ was committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provided guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities (the Enforcement Priorities) in preventing:

·
 the distribution of cannabis to minors;
 ·
 revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels;
 ·
 the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;
 ·
 state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
 ·
 violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis;
 ·
 drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use;
 ·
 the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and
 ·
 cannabis possession or use on federal property.

Although the Sessions Memo has rescinded the Cole Memo and it is unclear at this time what the ultimate impact of that rescission will have on our business, if any, we intend to continue to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in and ensure that our activities do not interfere with any of the Enforcement Priorities set forth in the Cole Memo.

FinCEN

FinCEN provided guidance regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their BSA obligations. For purposes of the FinCEN guidelines, a financial institution includes any person doing business in one or more of the following capacities:

·
 bank (except bank credit card systems);
 ·
 broker or dealer in securities;
 ·
 money services business;
 ·
 telegraph company;
 ·
 card club; and
 ·
 a person subject to supervision by any state or federal bank supervisory authority.

In general, the decision to open, close, or refuse any particular account or relationship should be made by each financial institution based on a number of factors specific to that institution. These factors may include its particular business objectives, an evaluation of the risks associated with offering a particular product or service, and its capacity to manage those risks effectively. Thorough customer due diligence is a critical aspect of making this assessment.

In assessing the risk of providing services to a cannabis-related business, a financial institution should conduct customer due diligence that includes: (i) verifying with the appropriate state authorities whether the business is duly licensed and registered; (ii) reviewing the license application (and related documentation) submitted by the business for obtaining a state license to operate its cannabis-related business; (iii) requesting from state licensing and enforcement authorities available information about the business and related parties; (iv) developing an understanding of the normal and expected activity for the business, including the types of products to be sold and the type of customers to be served (e.g., medical versus recreational customers); (v) ongoing monitoring of publicly available sources for adverse information about the business and related parties; (vi) ongoing monitoring for suspicious activity, including for any of the red flags described in this guidance; and (vii) refreshing information obtained as part of customer due diligence on a periodic basis and commensurate with the risk. With respect to information regarding state licensure obtained in connection with such customer due diligence, a financial institution may reasonably rely on the accuracy of information provided by state licensing authorities, where states make such information available.

As part of its customer due diligence, a financial institution should consider whether a cannabis-related business implicates one of the Cole Memo Enforcement Priorities or violates state law. This is a particularly important factor for a financial institution to consider when assessing the risk of providing financial services to a cannabis-related business. Considering this factor also enables the financial institution to provide information in BSA reports pertinent to law enforcements priorities. A financial institution that decides to provide financial services to a cannabis-related business would be required to file suspicious activity reports. It is unclear at this time what impact the Sessions Memo will have on customer due diligence by a financial institution.

While we believe we do not qualify as a financial institution in the United States, we cannot be certain that we do not fall under the scope of the FinCEN guidelines. We plan to use the FinCEN Guidelines, as may be amended, as a basis for assessing our relationships with potential tenants, clients and customers. As such, as we engage in financing activities, we intend to adhere to the guidance of FinCEN in conducting and monitoring our financial transactions. Because this area of the law is uncertain and is expected to evolve rapidly, we believe that FinCENs guidelines will help us best operate in a prudent, reasonable and acceptable manner. There is no assurance, however, that our activities will not violate some aspect of the CSA. If we are found to violate the federal statute or any other in connection with our activities, our company could face serious criminal and civil sanctions.

Moreover, since the use of cannabis is illegal under federal law, we may have difficulty acquiring or maintaining bank accounts and insurance, and our stockholders may find it difficult to deposit their stock with brokerage firms.

Licensing and Local Regulations

Where applicable, we will apply for state licenses or similar approvals that are necessary to conduct our business in compliance with local laws. Our subsidiary, ACS Corp., has been registered with Colorados Marijuana Enforcement Division (the MED) as an approved vendor since September 8, 2014. GCS, another subsidiary, has been registered as a MED approved vendor since March 11, 2015.

Local laws at the county and municipal level add an additional layer of complexity to legalized cannabis. Despite a states adoption of legislation legalizing cannabis, counties and municipalities within the state may have the ability to otherwise restrict cannabis activities, including but not limited to cultivation, retail, distribution, manufacturing or consumption.

9

Zoning sets forth the approved use of land in any given city, county or municipality. Zoning is set by local governments or local voter referendum, and may otherwise be restricted by state laws. For example, under certain state laws a seller of liquor may not be allowed to operate within 1,000 feet of a school. There may be similar restrictions imposed on cannabis operators, which will restrict where cannabis operations may be located and the manner and size to which they can grow and operate. Zoning can be subject to change or withdrawal, discretionary approvals may be required for certain uses, and properties can be re-zoned. The zoning of our properties will have a direct impact on our business operations.

Employees

As of December 31, 2017, we had 83 full-time employees.
