Item 1. Business
Overview
Centrus Energy Corp. (“Centrus” or the “Company”) is a trusted supplier of nuclear fuel and services for the nuclear power industry. References to “Centrus”, the “Company”, or “we” include Centrus Energy Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries as well as the predecessor to Centrus, unless the context otherwise indicates. 
Centrus’ primary business involves the sale of low-enriched uranium (“LEU”) or its components and natural uranium to utilities operating commercial nuclear power plants. LEU is a critical component in the production of nuclear fuel for reactors that produce electricity. We supply LEU to both domestic and international utilities for use in nuclear reactors worldwide. We provide LEU from multiple sources including our inventory, medium- and long- term supply contracts and spot purchases. As a long-term supplier of LEU to our customers, our objective is to provide value through the reliability and diversity of our supply sources. Our long-term goal is to resume commercial enrichment production, and we are exploring approaches to that end.
With our multi-decade experience in uranium enrichment, we continue to be a leader in the development of advanced uranium enrichment technology. We are performing research and demonstration work on our advanced centrifuge technology to support U.S. energy and national security through our contract with UT-Battelle, LLC (“UT-Battelle”), the management and operating contractor of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (“ORNL”) for the United States Department of Energy (“DOE”). We believe that this technology could play a critical role in meeting United States national and energy security needs and achieving our nation’s nonproliferation objectives.
The nuclear industry in general, and the nuclear fuel industry in particular, is in a period of significant change, which continues to affect the competitive landscape we face. The nuclear fuel industry remains oversupplied, creating downward pressures on commodity pricing, with uncertainty regarding the timing of industry expansion globally. Changes in the competitive landscape may adversely affect pricing trends, change customer spending patterns, or create uncertainty. To address these changes, we have taken steps to adjust our cost structure and may seek further adjustments to our cost structure and operations and to evaluate opportunities to grow our business organically or through acquisitions and other strategic transactions. 
We are working to leverage our unique technical expertise and facilities to support leading companies in the fields of advanced nuclear reactors, nuclear medicine, and related industries as well as the U.S. government. Our experience developing, licensing and manufacturing advanced nuclear technologies positions us to provide critical design, engineering, manufacturing and other services to a broad range of potential clients, including those involving sensitive or classified technologies.
We are also actively considering, and expect to consider from time to time in the future, potential strategic transactions, which could involve, without limitation, acquisitions and/or dispositions of businesses or assets, joint ventures or investments in businesses, products or technologies. In connection with any such transaction, we may seek additional debt or equity financing, contribute or dispose of assets, assume additional indebtedness, or partner with other parties to consummate a transaction.
Our Business Today
In 2017, our management team led the Company’s successful efforts to significantly reduce our long-term debt, reduce our future selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) costs, add new sales and customers to the LEU order book, and expand into new areas of the nuclear industry. We have worked to diversify our supply and revenue streams and position ourselves for long-term financial strength as we seek to remain a trusted partner to the global nuclear industry and return value to our shareholders.

Our competitive strengths include: 

• | Positioned for the long term: We have long-term nuclear fuel sales and supply contracts in place that extend well into the next decade; these contracts will provide a stream of revenue for many years and provide a foundation for growth. Because we do not have the large capital and overhead costs of a production facility, we are positioned to continue to obtain supply of LEU from an oversupplied market experiencing historically low prices, which we believe will strengthen our position for the future. 


• | Diverse supply portfolio: Our management team is focused on expanding and diversifying our supply base to provide additional value to our customers and to more effectively compete. We have entered into new agreements with suppliers of enriched uranium, diversifying and expanding our sources of supply and improving our logistics for delivery of enriched uranium. In addition, we have acquired access to additional enriched uranium supply from the excess inventories of utility operators of nuclear power plants and from other primary and secondary sources of enriched uranium supply. Our strategy is to remain a highly diversified and reliable supplier of LEU with the flexibility to meet the evolving needs of our customers and effectively compete in the marketplace. 


• | Technology development, deployment and manufacturing experience: Our expertise and world-leading technical, engineering and manufacturing capabilities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee create opportunities for us. First, through contracts with UT-Battelle, we are continuing to advance our U.S. centrifuge technology in specialized facilities in Oak Ridge so that it could be deployed if and when needed for national security purposes and/or deployed at a commercial scale enrichment facility over the long term once market conditions recover. Second, we seek to leverage our domestic enrichment experience and engineering know-how to assist private sector customers in production of fuel for next-generation nuclear reactors and the development of related facilities. 

We believe that our position as a leading provider of enriched uranium and our long-standing global relationships will enable us to increase our future market share in the nuclear fuel market and support our growth into complementary areas of the nuclear industry. We are well-positioned to capitalize on our heritage, industry-wide relationships, and diversity of supply to provide reliable and competitive sources of nuclear fuel and services. Centrus continues to be valued by our customers as a source of diversity, stability, and competition in the enrichment market. Moreover, our smaller size and lower fixed costs can be advantageous under the current excess capacity market conditions, allowing us to focus on using resources efficiently to grow the Company.

For a discussion of the potential risks and uncertainties facing our business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors.
Uranium and Enrichment
LEU consists of two components: separative work units (“SWU”) and uranium. Uranium is a naturally occurring element and is mined from deposits located in Kazakhstan, Canada, Australia, the United States and several other countries. According to the World Nuclear Association (“WNA”), there are adequate measured resources of uranium to fuel nuclear power at current usage rates for about 90 years. In its natural state, uranium is principally comprised of two isotopes: uranium-235 (“U235”) and uranium-238 (“U238”). The concentration of U235 in natural uranium is only 0.711% by weight. Most commercial nuclear power reactors require LEU fuel with a U235 concentration greater than natural uranium and up to 5% by weight. Uranium enrichment is the process by which the concentration of U235 is increased to that level. 
5

SWU is a standard unit of measurement that represents the effort required to transform a given amount of natural uranium into two components: enriched uranium having a higher percentage of U235 and depleted uranium having a lower percentage of U235. The SWU contained in LEU is calculated using an industry standard formula based on the physics of enrichment. The amount of enrichment deemed to be contained in LEU under this formula is commonly referred to as its SWU component and the quantity of natural uranium used in the production of LEU under this formula is referred to as its uranium or “feed” component. 
While in some cases customers purchase both the SWU and uranium components of LEU from us, utility customers typically provide uranium to us as part of their enrichment contracts, and in exchange we deliver LEU to these customers and charge for the SWU component. Title to uranium provided by customers generally remains with the customer until delivery of LEU, at which time title to LEU is transferred to the customer and we take title to the uranium.
The following outlines the steps for converting natural uranium into LEU fuel, commonly known as the nuclear fuel cycle:
Mining and Milling. Natural, or unenriched, uranium is removed from the earth in the form of ore and then crushed and concentrated. 
Conversion. Uranium concentrates (“U3O8”) are combined with fluorine gas to produce uranium hexafluoride (“UF6”), a solid at room temperature and a gas when heated. UF6 is shipped to an enrichment plant. 
Enrichment. UF6 is enriched in a process that increases the concentration of the U235 isotope in the UF6 from its natural state of 0.711% up to 5%, which is usable as a fuel for light water commercial nuclear power reactors. 
Fuel Fabrication. LEU is then converted to uranium oxide and formed into small ceramic pellets by fabricators. The pellets are loaded into metal tubes that form fuel assemblies, which are shipped to nuclear power plants.
Nuclear Power Plant. The fuel assemblies are loaded into nuclear reactors to create energy from a controlled chain reaction. Nuclear power plants generate approximately 20% of U.S. electricity and 11% of the world’s electricity.
Used Fuel Storage. After the nuclear fuel has been in a reactor for several years, its efficiency is reduced and the assembly is removed from the reactor’s core. The used fuel is warm and radioactive and is kept in a deep pool of water for several years. Many utilities have elected to then move the used fuel into steel or concrete and steel casks for interim storage.
Products and Services
We operate the following two business segments: 1) Low-Enriched Uranium and 2) Contract Services.
Low-Enriched Uranium 
Revenue from our LEU segment is derived primarily from:

• | sales of the SWU component of LEU,


• | sales of both the SWU and uranium components of LEU, and


• | sales of natural uranium.

6

Revenue for our LEU segment accounted for approximately 89% of our total revenue in 2017. Our customers are primarily domestic and international utilities that operate nuclear power plants. Our agreements with electric utilities are primarily long-term, fixed-commitment contracts under which our customers are obligated to purchase a specified quantity of the SWU component of LEU (or the SWU and uranium components of LEU) from us. Our agreements for natural uranium sales are generally shorter-term, fixed-commitment contracts.
Contract Services
Our Contract Services segment reflects our technical, manufacturing and engineering services offered to our public and private sector customers, including the American Centrifuge engineering and testing activities we perform as a contractor for UT-Battelle. With our private sector customers, we seek to leverage our domestic enrichment experience and engineering know-how to assist customers with a range of engineering and advanced manufacturing projects including the production of fuel for next-generation nuclear reactors and the development of related facilities.

SWU and Uranium Sales Order Book
The SWU component of LEU is typically bought and sold under long-term contracts with deliveries over several years. Our order book of sales under contract (“order book”) extends for more than a decade. As of December 31, 2017, our order book was $1.3 billion compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016. As previously disclosed, some long-term contracts in our order book were established with milestones related to the deployment of the American Centrifuge Plant (“ACP”) in Piketon, Ohio, that permit termination with respect to portions of the contract under limited circumstances. Further, some of our customers are facing financial difficulties and may seek modifications to their contracts or seek bankruptcy protection. We estimate that as of December 31, 2017, approximately 14% of our order book remains at risk due to milestones related to ACP deployment or due to customer financial conditions. As of December 31, 2016, we estimated that approximately 5% of our order book was at risk due to milestones related to ACP deployment. 
We anticipate our SWU and uranium revenue from the sales currently under contract in our order book will be in a range of $150 million to $175 million during 2018. Most of our contracts provide for fixed purchases of SWU during a given year. Our estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of future SWU and uranium sales is partially based on customers’ estimates of the timing and size of their fuel requirements and other assumptions that are subject to change. For example, depending on the terms of specific contracts, the customer may be able to increase or decrease the quantity delivered within an agreed range. Our order book estimate is also based on our estimates of selling prices, which are subject to change. For example, depending on the terms of specific contracts, prices may be adjusted based on escalation using a general inflation index, published SWU price indicators prevailing at the time of delivery, and other factors, all of which are variable. We use external composite forecasts of future market prices and inflation rates in our pricing estimates. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a discussion of risks related to our order book.
Suppliers
We have a diverse base of supply that includes:

• | existing inventory of LEU,


• | long-term contracts with enrichment producers,


• | secondary suppliers including utility operators of nuclear power plants that have excess inventory, and


• | spot purchases of SWU and uranium.

We have and will seek to continue to further diversify this base of supply and take advantage of the opportunities to obtain additional short and long-term supplies of LEU at prices consistent with the current market. 

Currently, our leading supplier of SWU is the Russian government entity Joint Stock Company “TENEX” (“TENEX”). Under an agreement with TENEX (the “Russian Supply Agreement”), we purchase SWU contained in LEU received from TENEX, and we deliver natural uranium to TENEX for the LEU’s uranium component. The Russian Supply Agreement extends to 2022 and gives us the right to reschedule certain quantities of SWU into the period 2023-2026, in return for the purchase of additional SWU in those years. Depending on the total purchase obligations rescheduled to 2023-2026, we may defer certain limited quantities beyond 2026. 
Under the Russian Supply Agreement, we pay for the SWU contained in the LEU delivered to us, and either supply natural uranium to TENEX for the uranium content of the LEU or, in limited cases, pay for such content. SWU pricing is determined by a formula that combines a mix of market-related price points and other factors. This formula is subject to an adjustment that we anticipate will reduce the unit cost of SWU under this contract beginning in 2019.
8

The LEU that we obtain from TENEX under the Russian Supply Agreement is currently subject to quotas and other restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to sell the purchased enrichment in the United States and other markets. The Russian Supply Agreement only gives us the right to use a portion of this quota, which is less than the amount of Russian LEU that we need to order to meet our SWU purchase obligations to TENEX. We can ask TENEX to make additional quota available to us, sell the SWU in foreign markets or secure a deferral to a future year of the portion of the purchase obligation under the Russian Supply Agreement for which we have insufficient quota. In the past we have been able to reach agreement with TENEX to either secure additional quota or defer our obligation, but TENEX’s willingness to enter into such agreements in the future is not known. Refer below to —Competition and Foreign Trade - Limitations on Imports of LEU from Russia.
We expect that a portion of the Russian LEU that we order during the term of the Russian Supply Agreement will need to be delivered to customers who will use it in foreign reactors. The Russian LEU that we deliver to foreign customers can be delivered either at fabrication facilities in the United States or in foreign countries. The amount of SWU we must purchase from TENEX under the Russian Supply Agreement exceeds our current sales order book and therefore we will need to make new sales to place all the Russian LEU we must order to meet our SWU purchase obligations to TENEX. In addition, due to quotas and other limitations, not all of our delivery obligations under our existing contracts can be met with Russian LEU. 
We procure LEU from other sources under short-term and long-term contracts and have inventories available that diversify our supply portfolio and provide flexibility to meet the needs of our customers.
Advanced Technology, Manufacturing, and Engineering Capability
We have a long record as a global leader in advanced technology, manufacturing and engineering. Our manufacturing, engineering and testing facilities and our highly-trained workforce are deeply engaged in advancing the next generation of uranium enrichment technology. We are exploring a number of options for returning to domestic production in the future. The economics for commercial deployment of new enrichment capacity are severely challenged by the current supply/demand imbalance in the market for LEU and related downward pressure on market prices for SWU, which are now at historic lows. Market conditions, however, are expected to improve in the long term.
Since September 2015, our government contracts with UT-Battelle have provided for continued engineering and testing work on the American Centrifuge technology at our facilities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In September 2016, we entered into a contract with UT-Battelle for the period from October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2017. The contract provided for payments for monthly reports of approximately $2.0 million per month and additional aggregate payments of $1.0 million based on completion of certain milestones and generated revenue of approximately $25.0 million. On October 26, 2017, the parties executed a new contract which provides for fixed payments upon completion of defined milestones for the period from October 1, 2017, through September 30, 2018, that is expected to generate total revenue of approximately $16.0 million upon timely completion of all defined milestones. Funding for the program is provided to UT-Battelle by the federal government.
In February 2016, we completed a successful three-year demonstration of the existing American Centrifuge technology at our facility in Piketon, Ohio, with 120 machines linked together in a cascade to simulate industrial operating conditions. Later in 2016, we commenced the decontamination and decommissioning (“D&D”) of the Piketon demonstration cascade. Most of the D&D work has been completed as of December 31, 2017. Refer below under — DOE Facilities.

Competition and Foreign Trade
It is estimated that the enrichment industry market is currently about 50 million SWU per year. Our global market share is approximately 3 percent. Global LEU suppliers in our highly competitive industry compete primarily on the basis of price and secondarily on reliability of supply and customer service. The three largest LEU suppliers comprise an estimated 90 percent of market share combined:

• | Rosatom, a Russian government entity, which sells LEU through its wholly owned subsidiary TENEX;


• | Urenco, a consortium of companies owned or controlled by the British and Dutch governments and by two German utilities; and


• | Orano, a company largely owned by the French government that was formerly part of the French government owned company, AREVA.

The production capacity for Rosatom/TENEX is estimated by the WNA to be approximately 27 million SWU per year. Imports of LEU and other uranium products produced in the Russian Federation are subject to restrictions through 2020 as described below under —Limitations on Imports of LEU from Russia.
Urenco reported installed capacity at its European and U.S. enrichment facilities of 18.8 million SWU per year at the end of 2016, down from 19.1 million at the end of 2015. Over the course of 2016, Urenco officials said that the company is no longer replacing older centrifuge machines that wear out, that it has taken two production halls offline at its Capenhurst site, and that it is no longer expanding enrichment capacity in the current market.
Orano’s gas centrifuge enrichment plant in France began commercial operations in 2011 and the plant’s nominal capacity of 7.5 million SWU was reportedly in service by the end of 2016. Orano has reported that it has suspended planned capacity expansions beyond 7.5 million SWU.
All of our current competitors are owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by foreign governments. These competitors may make business decisions in both domestic and international markets that are influenced by political or economic policy considerations rather than exclusively by commercial considerations.
There are also producers of LEU in China, Japan and Brazil that primarily serve a portion of their respective domestic markets. China is emerging as a growing producer and has begun to supply LEU to international markets. China’s commercial SWU production capacity is estimated to be approximately 6 million SWU per year. Additional capacity is also under construction which may increase capacity up to 9 million SWU per year by 2020.
LEU may also be produced by down-blending government stockpiles of highly-enriched uranium. Governments control the timing and availability of highly-enriched uranium released for this purpose, and the release of this material to the market could impact market conditions. Given the current oversupplied nuclear fuel market, any additional LEU from down-blended highly-enriched uranium released into the market would have a negative effect on prices for LEU.
LEU we supply to foreign customers is exported under the terms of international agreements governing nuclear cooperation between the United States and the country of destination or other entities, such as the European Union or the International Atomic Energy Agency. The LEU supplied to us is subject to the terms of cooperation agreements between the country in which the material is produced and the country of destination or other entities.

Limitations on Imports of LEU from Russia
Imports into the United States of LEU and other uranium products produced in the Russian Federation, including LEU imported under the Russian Supply Agreement, are subject to quotas imposed under legislation enacted into law in September 2008 and under the 1992 Russian Suspension Agreement, as amended in 2008. These quotas limit the amount of Russian LEU that can be imported into the United States for U.S. consumption. The quotas apply through 2020 and, for 2014-2020, are set at an amount equal to approximately 20% of projected annual U.S. consumption of LEU, based on a market report published in 2005 by the WNA (“2005 WNA Report”).
As an exception to the quotas on imports of LEU for U.S. consumption, both the Russian Suspension Agreement and the September 2008 legislation permit unlimited imports of Russian LEU for use in initial cores for any new U.S. nuclear reactor.
It is possible that the quotas on imports of Russian LEU could change. Both the Russian Suspension Agreement and the September 2008 legislation require the U.S. Department of Commerce (“DOC”) to adjust the quotas in 2016 and 2019 based on changes in projected reactor demand as forecast by the WNA. In 2016, the DOC preliminarily determined that the adjustment would increase the quotas, but this increase was challenged by U.S. uranium mining companies, and, in May 2017, the DOC finally determined to increase the quota in 2018 and to reduce it in 2019 and 2020. However, because contracts approved by the DOC prior to the change in the quotas are not affected by the quota adjustment, this change in the quotas in 2019 and 2020 are not expected to materially affect imports of Russian LEU in those years pursuant to such contracts.
Aside from the quotas on imports of Russian LEU that will be consumed in the United States, there is a separate quota that applies to deliveries of Russian LEU to foreign customers at U.S. fabrication facilities. This quota generally requires that the LEU be processed and re-exported within a certain period of time although, in 2014, the DOC approved our proposal that Japanese customers with which we have existing contracts be allowed to physically store certain amounts of Russian LEU in the United States pending the restart of nuclear reactors in Japan. 
During 2017, the DOC and the U.S. International Trade Commission conducted five year “sunset reviews” of the Russian Suspension Agreement. As a result of their reviews, both agencies determined that the Russian Suspension Agreement and the suspended investigation should remain in place. However, shortly after the sunset reviews were completed, Louisiana Energy Services (“LES”), a U.S. subsidiary of Urenco, a foreign competitor, requested that the DOC conduct an administrative review of the Russian Suspension Agreement for the period October 2016 through September 2017. By statute, the purpose of an administrative review is to review the current status of, and compliance with the Russian Suspension Agreement during the period of the review. Centrus is not aware of any violation of the Russian Suspension Agreement. However, in filings with the DOC, LES has requested the agency undertake a much broader review of whether the Russian Suspension Agreement continues to prevent the suppression or undercutting of price levels of domestic uranium products. The DOC has not determined the appropriate scope of the review. At the conclusion of its review, the DOC could leave the Russian Suspension Agreement in place, seek to either modify the Russian Suspension Agreement to impose additional or different restrictions on imports of Russian uranium products, including LEU, or terminate the Russian Suspension Agreement and restart the suspended investigation. 
Imposition of additional restrictions or the imposition of duties could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and could make it economically difficult or impossible for us to continue to import Russia LEU or sell the amounts required to be purchased under the Russian Supply Agreement. In that case, we would need to find alternative supplies of LEU to use to meet our obligations to U.S. customers, and also find alternative markets outside the United States in which to sell the Russian SWU that we are obligated to purchase from TENEX but which we could not import or sell in the United States. Alternatively, if, instead of restarting the investigation, the DOC agrees with the Russian government to modify the Russian Suspension Agreement and extend or impose new restrictions on imports of Russian LEU, our ability to continue to deliver Russian LEU to customers would depend upon whether we could secure an exception under those new restrictions or a share of any quota granted to TENEX.
11

We are actively participating in the administrative review and seeking to ensure that the Russian Suspension Agreement is implemented in a manner that does not adversely impact our existing contracts, including the Russian Supply Agreement, or our ability to continue to offer a diverse supply to our customers in the United States. The administrative review is expected to conclude by the end of 2018, but could be extended until the second quarter of 2019. In October 2019 and 2020, LES and other domestic parties will have additional opportunities to request that the DOC conduct administrative reviews. 
Absent an agreement between the DOC and the Russian government to extend the Russian Suspension Agreement (for example, as a result of the pending administrative review), the Russian Suspension Agreement (and the antidumping order that it suspended) will expire at the end of 2020. The quotas under the September 2008 legislation also are scheduled to expire at the end of 2020. 
Limitations on Imports of LEU from France
The DOC imposed an antidumping order on imports of French LEU in 2002.  The order is subject to periodic “sunset reviews” of the antidumping order to determine if it should be revoked. The next review will be initiated in late 2018 and will not be completed until 2019. We do not anticipate purchasing any SWU subject to French duties for delivery in the United States.
Other Trade Actions
On January 16, 2018, two U.S. mining companies submitted a request to the DOC to investigate the impact of uranium imports on national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. In the petition, these companies propose, as a remedy, that the President (1) impose quotas on imports that will ensure that 25% of the U.S. market is reserved to newly-produced U.S. uranium and (2) adopt a “Buy American” preference for purchases of all forms of uranium by U.S. agencies, including U.S. government corporations, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority. By statute, the investigation must be completed within 270 days after the investigation is initiated, with up to an additional 90 days granted for Presidential action after the investigation results are reported to the President.
The outcome of a national security investigation of uranium imports is difficult to predict. Even if the DOC found that imports threatened national security, the President is not obligated to grant the remedies requested by the mining companies but may choose to grant other remedies or to impose no remedies at all. Nonetheless, if the remedies requested by the mining companies were granted, the remedies could create additional barriers to imports or sales of non-U.S. uranium.
DOE Facilities
We produced LEU through May 2013 at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (“Paducah GDP”) in Paducah, Kentucky which we had leased from DOE. We then repackaged and transferred our existing inventory to offsite licensed locations under agreements with the operators of those facilities. Our prior enrichment operations generated hazardous, low-level radioactive and mixed wastes. The storage, treatment, and disposal of wastes are regulated by federal and state laws. The treatment and disposal of wastes from our prior operations at the Paducah GDP were completed in 2016. Regarding our past operations at the former Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (“Portsmouth GDP”) in Piketon, Ohio, DOE agreed in 2011 to accept ownership of all nuclear material at the site, some of which required processing for waste disposal. We agreed to pay DOE for costs for disposing of our share of such wastes. The treatment and disposal of wastes from our prior operations at the Portsmouth GDP were completed in 2017. 
The Portsmouth and Paducah gaseous diffusion plants were operated by agencies of the U.S. government for approximately 40 years prior to the Company’s privatization in 1998. As a result of such operation, there are contamination and other potential environmental liabilities associated with the plants. The USEC Privatization Act and our former leases for the plants provide that DOE remains responsible for the D&D of the gaseous diffusion plants. 
12

We continue to lease the portion of the DOE facility in Piketon, Ohio, that was formerly used to demonstrate the American Centrifuge technology. We commenced with D&D of the Piketon facility in accordance with U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) requirements in the second quarter of 2016. Most of the D&D work has been completed as of December 31, 2017. At the conclusion of the lease on June 30, 2019, without mutual agreement between us and DOE regarding other possible uses for the facility, we are obligated to return the facility to DOE in a condition that meets NRC requirements and in the same condition as the facility was in when it was leased to us (other than due to normal wear and tear). We must remove all Company-owned capital improvements at the Piketon facility, unless otherwise consented to by DOE, by the conclusion of the lease term.
