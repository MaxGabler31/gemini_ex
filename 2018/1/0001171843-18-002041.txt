Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

Overview 
 
Harvard Bioscience, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a global developer, manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of scientific instruments and systems used to advance life science for basic research, drug discovery, clinical and environmental testing. Our products are sold to thousands of researchers in over 100 countries through our global sales organization, websites, catalogs, and through distributors including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., VWR and other specialized distributors. We have sales and manufacturing operations in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Spain, France, Canada, and China.
Our History 
 
Our business began in 1901 under the name Harvard Apparatus. It was founded by Dr. William T. Porter, a Professor of Physiology at Harvard Medical School and a pioneer of physiology education. We have grown over the years with the development and evolution of modern life science research and education. Our early inventions included ventilators based on Dr. Porter’s design, the mechanical syringe pump for drug infusion in the 1950s, and the microprocessor controlled syringe pump in the 1980s.
 
In March of 1996, a group of investors acquired a majority of the then existing business of our predecessor, Harvard Apparatus, Inc. Following this acquisition, our focus was redirected to acquiring complimentary companies with innovative technologies while continuing to grow the existing business through internal product development. Since 1996, we have completed more than 26 business or product line acquisitions related to our continuing operations. We have also developed many new product lines including: new generation Harvard Apparatus syringe pumps, PHD Ultra series of syringe pumps, advanced Inspira ventilators, GeneQuant DNA/RNA/protein calculators, UVM plate readers, BTX Gemini X2 multi-waveform electroporation system, BioDrop micro-volume spectrophotometer and cuvette, OxyletPro metabolic monitoring system, Multi-Channel Systems’ automated four channel PatchServer, DP-304A amplifiers, Allegro Peristaltic pump systems, Centrifan small-volume evaporators and advanced VentElite ventilators.
 
Led by President and CEO Jeffrey A. Duchemin, we have conducted a multi-year restructuring program to reduce costs, align global functions, consolidate facilities to optimize our global footprint, divest non-core businesses and to reinvest in key areas such as sales and common IT systems. As part of these efforts, we divested our AHN Biotechnologie GmbH subsidiary (AHN) in the fourth quarter of 2016 and, during the first quarter of 2018, we sold substantially all the assets of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Denville Scientific, Inc. (Denville).

We are also pursuing a strategy to grow the business through strategic, accretive acquisitions, including four acquisitions since the fourth quarter of 2014.
 
Most recently, in January 2018, we acquired Data Sciences International, Inc. (DSI) for approximately $70.0 million. DSI, a St. Paul, Minnesota-based life science research company, is a recognized leader in physiologic monitoring focused on delivering preclinical products, systems, services and solutions to its customers. Its customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as contract research organizations, academic labs and government researchers. This acquisition diversifies our customer base into the biopharmaceutical and contract research organization markets and offers revenue and cost synergies.
 
Our Strategy 
 
Our vision is to be a world leading life science company that excels in meeting the needs of our customers by providing a wide breath of innovative products and solutions, while providing exemplary customer service. Our business strategy is to grow our top-line and bottom-line, and build shareholder value through a commitment to:

• | commercial excellence;
--+-----------------------


• | new product development;
--+-------------------------


• | strategic acquisitions; and
--+----------------------------


• | operational efficiencies.

Our Products 
 
As of December 31, 2017, our broad core product range was organized into three commercial product families: Physiology, Cell, Molecular Instruments (PCMI), Electrophysiology (Ephys), and Laboratory Products and Supplies (LPS). As of December 31, 2017, we primarily sold our products under brand names, including Harvard Apparatus, Denville Scientific, KD Scientific, Hoefer, Biochrom, BTX, Warner Instruments, MCS, HEKA, Hugo Sachs Elektronik, Panlab, Coulbourn Instruments, TBSI, and CMA Microdialysis. Following the sale of Denville and the acquisition of DSI in 2018, our core broad product ranges will be organized into three commercial product families, consisting of PCMI, Ephys, and Data Sciences.
 
Our products consist of instruments, consumables, and systems that are made up of several individual products. Sales prices of these products are mostly priced in the range of $5,000 to $15,000, but range from under $100 to over $100,000. We manufacture our products at our locations in the United States, Germany, Sweden and Spain.
 
In addition to our proprietary manufactured products, we sell many products that are made by other manufacturers. These distributed products accounted for approximately 36% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. Distributed products enable us to provide our customers with a single source for their research needs, and consist of a large variety of devices, instruments and consumable items used in experiments involving fluid handling, molecular and cell biology, tissue, organ and animal research. Many of our proprietary manufactured products are leaders in their fields; however, researchers often need complementary products in order to conduct particular experiments. Following is a description of each product family.
 
Physiology, Cell and Molecular Instruments Product Family
 
Our PCMI product family includes our traditional syringe pump and peristaltic pump product lines, as well as a broad range of instruments and accessories for tissue, organ and animal based lab research, including surgical products, infusion systems, microdialysis instruments, behavior research systems, and isolated organ and tissue bath systems. Our product offerings are marketed through our Harvard Apparatus, CMA Microdialysis, Panlab, Coulbourn, Hugo Sachs brands and entities. We sell these products through our global sales force, technical service team and our global distribution channel.
 
The PCMI product family also includes spectrophotometers, microplate readers, amino acid analyzers, gel electrophoresis equipment, and electroporation instruments. We market them under the names Biochrom, Libra, WPA, BioDrop, Hoefer, Scie-plas, and BTX. We sell them primarily through our distribution arrangements with various distributors.
 
Our PCMI product family made up approximately 56% of our global revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Electrophysiology Family
 
The Electrophysiology product family includes the brands Multi-Channel Systems, HEKA, TBSI and Warner Instruments.
 
Multi-Channel Systems focuses on the development and manufacture of precision scientific measuring instrumentation and equipment in the field of electrophysiology including:
 

• | Data acquisition systems, for use with custom amplifier configurations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Complete in vivo-systems, the solution for in vivo recordings with microelectrode arrays.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Complete in vitro-systems for extracellular recordings from microelectrode arrays in vitro.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
HEKA also develops, designs and manufactures precision electrophysiology equipment specializing in Patch Clamp Amplifiers and both manual and automated Patch Clamp Systems along with the associated software. The brand also specializes in instrumentation and equipment for Electrochemistry.
 
Warner Instruments manufactures specialized tools for Electrophysiology and Cell Biology research including cell chambers, perfusion controllers, temperature controllers, microincubation systems and bio-sensing systems.
 
TBSI designs and develops in vivo neural interface systems research to aid neuroscience research, especially in the fields of electrophysiology, psychology, neurology and pharmacology. This includes both wireless and tethered systems for both stimulation and recording.
 
Our Electrophysiology product family made up approximately 20% of our global revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
Laboratory Products and Supplies Family
 
The LPS family consisted of the Denville Scientific brands.
 
Denville sold laboratory products such as syringe pipettes and tips, reagents, gloves, and other equipment. As discussed above, during the first quarter of 2018, we sold substantially all the assets of Denville, and we shortly thereafter acquired Data Sciences International. As such during 2018, the Laboratory Products and Supplies Family was replaced with the Data Sciences product family.
 
Our LPS family made up approximately 24% of our global revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017.


Our Customers 
 
Our end-user customers are primarily research scientists at universities, hospitals, government laboratories, including the United States National Institute of Health (NIH), and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We also have global and regional distribution partners, and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers who incorporate our products into their products under their brands. Our academic customers, which account for approximately 70% of our revenues historically, include major colleges and universities such as Baylor College of Medicine, Cambridge University, Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of California system, University of Texas - MD Anderson Center and Yale University. Our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers have included pharmaceutical companies and research laboratories such as Amgen, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Genentech, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson. We have tens of thousands of customers worldwide and no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2017.
 
With the sale of Denville and the acquisition of DSI, both in January 2018, the percentage of our revenues that is derived from academic customers will decline from approximately 70% to closer to 60% on a pro forma basis.
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
We conduct direct sales in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain, Sweden, Canada and China. We sell primarily through distributors in other countries. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from direct sales to end-users represented approximately 65% of our revenues; and revenues from sales of our products through distributors represented approximately 35% of our revenues.

Direct Sales 
 
We have a global sales organization managing both direct sales and distributors. Our websites and catalogs serve as the primary sales tool for our Harvard Apparatus, Denville and other product lines, which includes both proprietary manufactured products and complementary products from various suppliers. Our reputation as a leading producer of many of our manufactured products creates traffic to our websites, enables cross-selling and facilitates the introduction of new products.
Distributors 
 
We engage distributors for the sales of our own branded and private label products in certain areas of the world and for certain product lines.
 
Research and Development
 
Our principal research and development mission is to develop products that address growth opportunities within the life science research process, as well as to maintain and optimize our existing product portfolios. We maintain development staff in many of our manufacturing facilities to design and develop new products and to re-engineer existing products to bring them to the next generation. Our research and development expenses were approximately $5.6 million, $5.4 million and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. From time to time, we receive grants from governmental entities in relation to research projects. Such grants received are accounted for as a reduction in research and development expenses over the period of the project. We anticipate that we will continue to make investments in research and development activities as we deem appropriate. We plan to continue to pursue a balanced development portfolio strategy of originating new products from internal research and acquiring products through business and technology acquisitions.
Manufacturing 
 
We manufacture and test the majority of our products in our principal manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Sweden, Spain and Germany. We have considerable manufacturing flexibility at our various facilities, and each facility can manufacture multiple products at the same time. We maintain in-house manufacturing expertise, technologies and resources. We seek to maintain multiple suppliers for key components that are not manufactured in-house, and while some of our products are dependent on sole-source suppliers, we do not believe our dependence upon these suppliers creates any significant risks.
 
Our manufacturing operations primarily involve assembly and testing activities along with some machine based processes.

Competition 
 
The markets into which we sell some of our products are highly competitive, and we expect the intensity of competition to continue or increase. We compete with many companies engaged in developing and selling tools for life science research. Many of our competitors have greater financial, operational, sales and marketing resources, and more experience in research and development and commercialization than we have. Moreover, our competitors may have greater name recognition than we do, and many offer discounts as a competitive tactic. These competitors and other companies may have developed or could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products, which could render our products obsolete. We cannot assure you that we will be able to make the enhancements to our technologies necessary to compete successfully with newly emerging technologies. We believe that we offer one of the broadest selections of products to organizations engaged in life science research. We have numerous competitors on a product line basis. We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of product performance, including quality, reliability and speed, technical support, price and delivery time.
 
We compete with several companies that provide instruments for life science research including, Lonza Group Ltd., Becton Dickinson, Eppendorf AG, Razel Scientific Instruments, Inc., Ugo Basile, Danaher Corporation, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., PerkinElmer, Inc. and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.
 
We cannot forecast if or when these or other companies may develop competitive products. We expect that other products will compete with our products and potential products based on efficacy, safety, cost and intellectual property positions. While we believe that these will be the primary competitive factors, other factors include, in certain instances, availability of supply, manufacturing, marketing and sales expertise and capability.
 
Seasonality 
 
Sales and earnings in our third quarter are usually flat or down from the second quarter primarily because there are a large number of holidays and vacations during such quarter, especially in Europe. Additionally, academic institutions in the northern hemisphere typically take a hiatus during the summer months. Our fourth quarter revenues and earnings are often the highest in any fiscal year compared to the other three quarters, primarily because many of our customers tend to spend budgeted money before their own fiscal year ends.
Intellectual Property 
 
To establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade-secret laws, as well as confidentiality provisions in our contracts. Patents or patent applications cover certain of our new technologies. Most of our more mature product lines are protected by trade names and trade secrets only.
 
We have implemented a patent strategy designed to provide us with freedom to operate and facilitate commercialization of our current and future products. Our success depends, to a significant degree, upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies. We intend to continue to file patent applications as we develop new products and technologies.
 
Patents provide some degree of protection for our intellectual property. However, the assertion of patent protection involves complex legal and factual determinations and is therefore uncertain. The scope of any of our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection. In addition, our issued patents or patents licensed to us may be successfully challenged, invalidated, circumvented or unenforceable so that our patent rights would not create an effective competitive barrier. Moreover, the laws of some foreign countries may protect our proprietary rights to a greater or lesser extent than the laws of the United States. In addition, the laws governing patentability and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve, particularly in areas of interest to us. As a result, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any of our patent applications or from applications licensed to us. As a result of these factors, our intellectual property positions bear some degree of uncertainty.
 
We also rely in part on trade-secret protection of our intellectual property. We attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants. Our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in patents and copyrights arising from their work for us. Although many of our United States employees have signed agreements not to compete unfairly with us during their employment and after termination of their employment, through the misuse of confidential information, soliciting employees, soliciting customers and the like, the enforceability of these provisions varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and, in some circumstances, they may not be enforceable. In addition, it is possible that these agreements may be breached or invalidated and if so, there may not be an adequate corrective remedy available. Despite the measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property, we cannot assure you that third parties will not independently discover or invent competing technologies, or reverse engineer our trade secrets or other technologies. Therefore, the measures we are taking to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate.

We do not believe that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of any third party. We cannot assure you, however, that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our licensors with respect to current or future products. We expect that product developers in our market will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our market segment grows and the product functionality in different market segments overlaps. In addition, patents on production and business methods are becoming more common and we expect that more patents will be issued in our technical field. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention and resources, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Moreover, such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be on terms advantageous to us, or acceptable at all, which could seriously harm our business or financial condition.
 
“Harvard” is a registered trademark of Harvard University. The marks “Harvard Apparatus” and “Harvard Bioscience” are being used pursuant to a license agreement entered into in December 2002 between us and Harvard University.
 
Government Regulation 
 
We are not subject to direct governmental regulation other than the laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses in the domestic and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. In particular, our current products are not subject to pre-market approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use on human clinical patients. In addition, we believe we are currently in compliance with all relevant environmental laws.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 434 employees, of which 413 are full-time and 21 are part-time. As of December 31, 2016, we employed 435 employees, of which 411 were full-time and 24 were part-time.
