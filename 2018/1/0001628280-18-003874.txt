Item 1. Business
Tillys is a leading destination specialty retailer of casual apparel, footwear and accessories for young men, young women, boys and girls. We believe we bring together an unparalleled selection of iconic global, emerging and proprietary brands rooted in an active and outdoor lifestyle. Our stores and website are designed to be a seamless extension of our teen and young adult consumers' lifestyles in a stimulating environment. Tillys is headquartered in Irvine, California and we operated 219 stores in 32 states as of February 3, 2018. Our stores are located in malls, lifestyle centers, ‘power’ centers, community centers, outlet centers and street-front locations. Customers may also shop online, where we feature the same assortment of products as is carried in our brick-and-mortar stores, supplemented by additional online-only styles. We believe our success across a variety of real estate venues and geographies in the United States demonstrates Tillys' portability. Our goal is to serve as a destination for the most relevant merchandise and brands important to our customers. 
The Tillys concept began in 1982 when our co-founders, Hezy Shaked and Tilly Levine, opened their first store in Orange County, California. Tilly's, Inc., a Delaware corporation, conducted an initial public offering on May 2, 2012, becoming the publicly-traded entity that operates the Tillys business through its wholly-owned subsidiary, World of Jeans & Tops, a California corporation.
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. For example, "fiscal 2017" refers to the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018, "fiscal 2016" refers to the fiscal year ended January 28, 2017; and "fiscal 2015" refers to the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016.
As used in this annual report on Form 10-K, except where the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated, the terms "the Company", "World of Jeans and Tops", "WOJT", "we", "our", "us", and "Tillys" refer to World of Jeans & Tops before our initial public offering, and to Tilly's, Inc. and its subsidiary after our initial public offering.
Our Strengths 
We believe that the following competitive strengths contribute to our success and distinguish us from our competitors:

• | Destination retailer with a broad and differentiated assortment. We believe the combined depth and breadth of apparel, footwear and accessories offered at our stores exceeds the selection offered at many other specialty retailers. We offer an extensive selection of over 400 third-party lifestyle brands over the course of a given year, which are complemented by our proprietary brands. Our merchandise includes a wide assortment of brands, styles, colors, sizes and price points to ensure we have what our customers want every time they visit our stores. We offer a balanced mix of merchandise across the apparel, footwear and accessories categories serving young men, young women, boys and girls. We believe that by combining proven and emerging fashion trends and core style products with a vibrant blend of carefully selected music and visuals, we provide an in-store experience that is authentic, fun, and engaging for our core customers. We believe that our differentiated in-store environment, evolving selection of relevant brands, and broader and deeper assortment positions us as a retail destination that appeals to a larger demographic than many other specialty retailers and encourages customers to visit our stores more frequently and spend more on each trip.


• | Dynamic merchandise model. We believe our extensive selection of third-party and proprietary merchandise allows us to identify and offer several trends simultaneously, offer a greater range of price points, and manage our inventories more dynamically. By closely monitoring trends and shipping product to our stores multiple times per week, we are able to adjust our merchandise mix based on store size and location. We also keep our merchandise mix relevant by introducing emerging brands not available at many other retailers. Our merchandising capabilities enable us to adjust our merchandise mix with a frequency that promotes a current look to our stores and website and encourages frequent visits.


• | Flexible real estate strategy across real estate venues and geographies. Our stores have proven to be successful in different real estate venues and geographies. We operate stores in malls, power centers, neighborhood and lifestyle centers, outlet centers and street-front locations across 85 markets in 32 states. We believe our success operating in these different retail venues and geographies demonstrates the portability of the Tillys brand.


• | Multi-pronged marketing approach. We utilize a multi-pronged marketing strategy to connect with our customers and drive traffic to our stores and online platforms. We distribute catalogs, newspapers and postcards to potential and existing customers from our proprietary database to familiarize them with the Tillys brand, our products, and to drive traffic to our stores and website. We offer an integrated digital platform between our online and mobile applications for our customers to shop how and when they like and to drive further connection with them. We partner and collaborate with our vendors on exclusive, compelling in-store events and contests to build credibility with our target customers, actively involve them in our brands, and enhance the connection between Tillys and our customers' active lifestyle. We use social media to communicate directly with our customers while also encouraging customers to interact with one another and provide

feedback on our events and products. We have a customer loyalty program to further engage with our customers, build customer loyalty, reward our most loyal customers, and gain customer insights. All of these programs are complemented by digital and email marketing, as well as print advertising, to build customer awareness and loyalty, highlight key merchandise offerings, drive traffic to our stores and online platforms, and promote the Tillys brand. Also, through our “We Care Program”, we support and participate in various academic, art, and athletic programs at local schools and other organizations in communities surrounding our stores.

• | Systems and distribution/fulfillment infrastructure to support growth. We have previously made investments in distribution, fulfillment and allocation infrastructure that we believe are adequate to support continued growth for several years. Our distribution center allows us to quickly sort and process merchandise and deliver it to our stores in a floor-ready format for immediate display. We also have a dedicated e-commerce fulfillment center to support our future online growth potential. Our systems enable us to respond to changing fashion trends, manage inventory in real time, and provide a customized selection of merchandise at each location. We believe our distribution and fulfillment infrastructure can support significant growth in our stores and e-commerce platform with minimal incremental capital investment.


• | Experienced management team. Our senior management team, led by Hezy Shaked and Edmond Thomas, has extensive experience across a wide range of disciplines in the specialty retail and direct-to-consumer industries, including store operations, merchandising, distribution, real estate, and finance. Mr. Shaked, our Co-Founder, Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Chief Strategy Officer, plays an important role in developing our long-term growth initiatives and cultivating our unique culture. Mr. Thomas, our President and Chief Executive Officer, rejoined Tillys in October 2015 with over 30 years of retail experience. He previously served as our President and Co-Chief Executive Officer from September 2005 to October 2007.

Growth Strategy 
We are pursuing several strategies to drive long-term sales and profitability, including:

• | Drive Comparable Store Sales. We seek to maximize our comparable store sales by consistently offering new, on-trend and relevant merchandise, including exclusive and proprietary branded merchandise, across a broad assortment of categories, increasing our brand awareness through our multi-pronged marketing approach, providing an authentic store and online experience for our core customers, and maintaining a high level of customer service. We believe the combination of these factors, together with the operating strategies described below, will improve our comparable store sales results over time.


• | Increase Our Operating Margins. We believe we have the opportunity to drive operating margin expansion through scale efficiencies and continued process improvements. We believe comparable store sales increases will permit us to take advantage of largely fixed occupancy costs, favorable buying costs from larger volume purchases, leverage of our costs for store management and corporate overhead, as well as the fixed portion of shipping and handling costs over higher sales volumes. In addition, we expect to improve operating margins and support growth by leveraging previous investments in infrastructure, including our dedicated fulfillment center for e-commerce, upgraded e-commerce platform, ongoing investments to upgrade our point-of-sale, merchandise allocation and merchandise planning systems. We also will continue to use established business processes to identify and execute initiatives focused on lowering our unit costs and improving operational efficiency throughout our organization.


• | Continue Growing E-Commerce. We believe our e-commerce platform is an extension of our brand and retail stores, providing our customers a seamless shopping experience. Our e-commerce platform allows us to provide our customers with extensions of the same assortment offered in our brick-and-mortar stores, reach new customers, and build our brand in markets where we currently do not have stores. For example, we generate e-commerce sales in all 50 states although we have physical stores in only 32 states. Our target customer regularly shops online and via mobile devices in addition to visiting stores, giving us a continued opportunity to grow our e-commerce platform over time. In fiscal 2017, we commenced implementation of a new platform for our e-commerce website. In fiscal 2018, we plan to upgrade our mobile application to provide an enhanced customer experience. Key factors we expect to drive growth include continuing our catalog, online and mobile application marketing efforts, enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of our digital capabilities, and supplementing the assortment available in our brick-and-mortar stores with additional online-only styles. We also expect to expand marketing efforts and build brand awareness in the communities surrounding our existing stores to drive growth in both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce sales.


• | Improve Inventory Management. We believe we can improve our operating results through improved micro-merchandising based on specific store characteristics. We regularly update individual store profiles for every store to highlight the differences in brand performance, gender penetrations, and customer interests that exist within our fleet of stores. By adapting allocation strategies to capitalize on these individual store differences, we believe we can improve sales results in our existing store base.

6


• | Develop Omni-Channel Capabilities. We have a direct-to-consumer program that allows online orders to be fulfilled and shipped directly to our customers from our brick-and-mortar stores when inventory is otherwise unavailable in our e-commerce fulfillment center. In addition, during fiscal 2017, we invested in additional omni-channel capabilities allowing for online orders to be picked up in stores at our customers' discretion, allowing us to satisfy an order from existing inventories within our stores as well as shipping product from our e-commerce fulfillment center to our stores. We believe these omni-channel capabilities will drive additional traffic to our stores and increase sales opportunities with customers who come to the store to pick up their online orders.


• | Reinvest in Existing Stores. We believe that re-investing in our existing stores is strategically important to enhance customer loyalty, elevate the customer experience and, in turn, drive additional comparable store sales. We have remodeled or refreshed many of our stores in recent years, and intend to continue to do so in the future to keep the physical representation of the Tillys brand updated and compelling for our customers.


• | Real Estate Opportunities. With 219 total stores at the end of fiscal 2017, we believe there are numerous attractive opportunities for Tillys to continue to open new stores in the future. During fiscal 2018, we plan to open up to 15 new stores. Additionally, we expect to open three RSQ-branded pop-up stores to improve the brand awareness of both Tillys and our proprietary RSQ brand. With regard to existing stores, we have an aggregate of approximately 120 lease decisions to make over the course of fiscal 2018 and 2019 covering a range of stores across all markets. These lease decisions include lease extension options, lease kick-out options, and lease expirations that require negotiated renewals. In each case, our real estate decisions will be driven by the overarching goal of improving our profitability. As a result, we may likely close stores from time to time if acceptable levels of profitability cannot be obtained through occupancy negotiations with landlords. 

Merchandising, Purchasing, and Planning and Allocation
Merchandising
We seek to be viewed by our customers as the destination for the apparel, footwear and accessories that best represent their active, connected lifestyle. We believe we offer an unparalleled selection of relevant brands, styles, colors, sizes and price points to ensure we have what our customers want every time they visit our stores. Our extensive selection of third-party and proprietary merchandise allows us to identify and address trends more quickly, offer a greater range of price points and manage our inventories more dynamically. We offer a balanced mix of merchandise for young men, young women, boys and girls across the apparel, footwear and accessories categories. We believe this category mix contributes to our broad demographic appeal. Our apparel merchandise includes branded, fashion and core styles for tops, outerwear, bottoms, and dresses. Accessories merchandise includes backpacks, hats, sunglasses, headphones, handbags, watches, jewelry and more. We focus on our merchandise presentation and vary the visual displays in our stores and windows throughout the month, presenting new looks and fashion combinations to our customers.
Our ability to maintain an image consistent with our customers' lifestyle is important to our branded vendors and provides us better access to a wide assortment of products and styles. Our third-party branded merchandise includes a selection of over 400 globally recognized, lifestyle, and emerging brands over the course of a year. In each of the last three fiscal years, over 100 of these brands each generated net sales in excess of $0.5 million for us. We strive to keep our merchandise mix current by continuously introducing emerging brands and styles not available at many other specialty retailers in order to identify and respond to the evolving desires of our customers. Our third-party brands represented approximately 74%, 72% and 72% of our total net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No single third-party brand exceeded 7% of our total net sales in the last three years.
Selected third-party brands include, in alphabetical order:

• AYC• Adidas• Billabong• Brixton• Converse• Diamond Supply• Dickies• Ethika• G-Shock• Hurley• HUF | • Jansport• Levi’s• LRG• Neff• Nike SB• Nixon• O’Neill• Primitive• RayBan• Riot Society• Rip Curl | • Roxy• RVCA• Salty Crew• Santa Cruz• Spy• Stance• The North Face• Vans• Volcom ...and many more 

7

We supplement our third-party merchandise assortment with our own proprietary brands across many of our product categories. We utilize our own branded merchandise to expand our price point range, identify and respond to changing fashion trends quickly, fill merchandise gaps and provide a deeper selection of styles and colors for proven fashion items. Our proprietary brands represented approximately 26%, 28% and 28% of our total net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Examples of our proprietary branded merchandise include:

Brand | Category 
 | Denim, apparel and fragrance brand for young men, young women and kids
Apparel and accessories brand for young women and girls
Apparel and accessories brand for young men and boys 
Fragrance brand for young men 
 | Apparel and fragrance brand for young women 
 | Apparel for young women 
 | Apparel for girls 

We believe that our extensive selection of merchandise, from established and emerging third-party brands as well as our proprietary brands, caters to a wide demographic of core customers and enhances our store image as a destination that carries the most sought-after apparel, footwear and accessories.
Merchandise Purchasing
Our merchandising team is organized by category and product type under our Chief Merchandising Officer and includes divisional merchandise managers, a technical design and fashion trend team, buyers, associate buyers and assistant buyers. We believe a key element of our success is our team’s ability to identify and source the proven and emerging fashion trends and core styles that are most relevant to our customers.
Our purchasing approach focuses on product relevance, quality, fit, availability, cost and speed of production in order to provide timely frequent delivery of merchandise to our stores. Our purchasing group and planning and allocation team are highly coordinated and maintain a disciplined buying strategy.
To ensure a relevant assortment, our teams:

• | perform comprehensive analysis of sales trends from our stores and e-commerce site;


• | perform in-store visits and gather feedback from our customers and our staff;


• | maintain regular dialogue with our existing vendor network and potential new vendors;


• | utilize trend and color forecasting services;


• | participate in trade shows and action sport related events;

8


• | review trade publications; and


• | evaluate merchandise assortments offered by other retail and online merchants.

We have developed and maintain strong and, in many cases, long-standing relationships with our third-party vendors and we have a history of identifying and growing with emerging brands. We believe the Tillys brand, shopping experience and core customer lifestyle is highly consistent with the image and philosophy of our key vendors. This, in addition to our customer connectivity, facilitates a partnership culture with our key vendors and provides us access to an extensive variety of products and styles, as well as certain merchandise that is exclusive to our stores and website. Our merchandise purchasing group also works closely with independent third parties who design and procure merchandise for our proprietary brands. Our proprietary brand capabilities enhance our ability to rapidly identify and respond to trends and consistently offer proven fashion items that provide a broader demographic appeal. We work with more than 100 vendors based in the United States to supply us with our proprietary branded product. These vendors source from both domestic and international markets and either have their own factories or contract with owners of factories to source finished product. By sourcing merchandise for our proprietary brands both domestically and internationally, we have the flexibility to benefit from shorter lead times associated with domestic manufacturing and lower costs associated with international manufacturing.
Planning and Allocation
We have developed inventory planning and allocation processes to support our merchandising strategies. Working closely with our merchandise purchasing team, the planning and allocation team utilizes a disciplined approach to buying, forecasting, inventory control and allocation processes. Our planning and allocation team continually analyzes information from our management information system, including inventory levels and sell-through data, to regularly adjust the assortment at each store and the inventory levels for our company as a whole. Our broad third-party vendor base allows us to shift merchandise purchases to react quickly to changing consumer preferences and market conditions. Furthermore, the vendor base for our proprietary products provides us flexibility to develop our own branded products to quickly address emerging fashion trends and provide a deeper selection of styles, colors, and price points for proven fashion items. We modify our merchandising mix based upon store size, the season, and consumer preferences in different parts of the country. We are also able to react quickly to changing customer needs due to our shipment of merchandise to our stores multiple times per week. Finally, we coordinate closely with our visual merchandise managers and marketing group in order to manage inventory levels in connection with our promotions and seasonality.
Stores
As of February 3, 2018, we operated 219 stores in 32 states with an average size of approximately 7,600 square feet. Our stores are located in mall, off-mall and outlet locations. Our stores generated average net sales of $2.3 million per store, or $296 per square foot, in fiscal 2017. 
The table below shows our number of stores by type of retail center as of the end of each of the last three fiscal years:

 | 2017 | 2016 | | 2015
Regional Mall | 119 | | 114 | | 114
Off-Mall (1) | 85 | | 90 | | 90

Distinctive Store Experience
Tillys is a customer-driven lifestyle brand. We are energized and inspired by our customers’ individuality and passion for an active, connected lifestyle. Our stores bring these interests together in a vibrant, stimulating and authentic environment that is an extension of our customers’ multi-tasking lifestyle. We do this by blending the most relevant brands and styles with music videos, product-related visuals and a dedicated team of store associates. Our associates share the same passion as our customers for action sports, music, art and fashion, enabling them to easily engage with our customers and make shopping at Tillys a fun, social experience. Outside of our stores, we connect with our consumers using the same authentic approach, including social media, community outreach and sponsorship of contests, demos, and other events. We believe the Tillys experience drives customer awareness, loyalty and repeat visits while generating a buzz and excitement for our brand.
Store Expansion Opportunities and Site Selection
The following table shows the number of stores opened and closed in each of our last five fiscal years:
 
Fiscal Year | StoresOpened | StoresClosed | Total Numberof Stores atEnd of Period
2013 | 28 | 1 | 195 
2014 | 19 | 2 | 212 
2015 | 15 | 3 | 224 
2016 | 3 | 4 | 223 
2017 | 2 | 6 | 219 
 | 67 | 16 | 

During fiscal 2018, we plan to open up to 15 new stores and three new RSQ-branded pop-up stores. We focus on opening new stores in locations that have above-average incomes and an ability to draw from a sufficient population with attractive demographics. Given the recent industry trends of declining customer traffic in physical stores, we will remain opportunistic and selective about additional new store opportunities.
Store Management, Culture and Training
We believe that a key to our success is our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate qualified employees at all levels of our organization. Each of our stores typically operates with a three to five member store management team. In addition, each store has 10 or more full time equivalent store associates who represent an active lifestyle and promote the Tillys brand not only inside the store, but also in their schools and communities. The number of store associates we employ generally increases during peak selling seasons, particularly the back-to-school and the winter holiday seasons, and will increase to the extent that we open new stores.
10

We have developed a corporate culture that we believe empowers the individual store managers to make store-level business decisions and we reward them when they exceed sales targets. We are committed to improving the skills and careers of our workforce and providing advancement opportunities for employees. We evaluate our store associates weekly on measures such as sales per hour, units per transaction and dollars per transaction to ensure productivity, to recognize top performers and to identify potential training opportunities. We endeavor to design incentive programs for store associates that promote a competitive, yet fun, culture that is consistent with our image.
We provide our managers with the knowledge and tools to succeed through comprehensive training programs, focusing on both operational expertise and supervisory skills. Our training programs and workshops are offered at the store, district and regional levels, allowing managers from multiple locations to interact with each other and exchange ideas to better operate stores. Store associates receive training from their managers to improve their product expertise and selling skills.
E-Commerce
Our e-commerce platform was established in 2004 and has grown significantly since inception, generating total sales of $76 million during fiscal 2017, or 13.1% of our total net sales. In fiscal 2017, we commenced implementation of a new platform for our e-commerce website. Our online business is served by a dedicated e-commerce fulfillment center in Irvine, California that can accommodate significant additional growth. In fiscal 2018, we plan on upgrading our mobile application to provide an enhanced customer experience. We believe our digital platform is an extension of our brand and retail stores, providing our customers a seamless shopping experience. We believe that our target customer regularly shops online through various digital channels in addition to visiting stores. Our website serves both as a sales channel and a marketing tool to our extended customer base, including those customers in markets where we do not currently have stores. In both fiscal 2017 and 2016, we sold merchandise to customers in all 50 states even though we have brick-and-mortar stores in only 32 states. We also believe our fully integrated digital platform reinforces the Tillys brand image and serves as an effective advertising vehicle for our retail stores. Our digital platform provides the same assortment available in our brick-and-mortar stores, supplemented by additional online-only styles. Similar to the merchandising approach in our stores, we frequently change the look of our website to highlight new brands and products and to encourage frequent visits. We utilize multiple tools to drive traffic online, including our catalog, newspaper, postcards, marketing materials in our retail stores, search engine marketing, internet ad placement, shopping site partnerships, third-party affiliations, email marketing, digital marketing and direct mail. In addition, we utilize the website to offer current information on our upcoming events, promotions and store locations.
Marketing and Advertising
Our marketing approach is designed to create an authentic connection with our customers by consistently generating excitement for our brand and the connected, active lifestyle we represent. We utilize a multi-pronged marketing strategy to connect with our customers and drive traffic to our stores and online platform, comprised of the following:

• | Catalog, Newspaper Ads, Postcards. We view our catalog, newspaper ads and postcards in print format and our digital-format catalog primarily as sales and marketing tools to drive online and store traffic from both existing and new customers. We also believe our marketing materials reinforce the Tillys brand and showcases our comprehensive selection of products in settings designed to reflect our brand’s lifestyle image. We send these marketing materials, which include coupons that can be redeemed at stores or online, to the customers in our database several times a year, primarily around key shopping periods such as spring break, back-to-school, and the winter holidays.


• | Brand Partnerships. We partner and collaborate with our vendors for exclusive events such as autograph signings, in-store performances, contests, demos, giveaways, shopping sprees and VIP trips. We organize a variety of events, many involving musicians, celebrities and athletes in the entertainment, music and action sports industries. Through brand partnerships such as these, we are able to connect with and engage our customers in an exciting, authentic experience.


• | Social Media. We believe our core customers rely heavily on the opinions of their peers, often expressed through social media. Therefore, we use our website blog, as well as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat posts, as a viral marketing platform to communicate directly with our customers while also allowing customers to interact with one another and provide feedback on our events and products.


• | Loyalty Program. During fiscal 2016, we launched an improved and rebranded customer loyalty program designed to interact with our customers in a more direct and targeted manner, and to provide more insight into their shopping behaviors and preferences. This program offers more frequent and compelling rewards to our most loyal customers than our previous program.


• | Community Outreach. Through our “We Care Program” and in partnership with our vendors, we support and participate in various academic, art, and athletic programs at local schools and other organizations in communities surrounding our stores. We also support Tilly’s Life Center, founded by our co-founder, Tilly Levine, which provides underprivileged youth a healthy and caring environment to help create a well-defined sense of self, cultivate community mindedness and release negative emotional stress.

11


• | Email Marketing. We utilize email marketing to build awareness, drive traffic to our stores and online platform and to promote local in-store promotions and events. We periodically send emails to the customers in our proprietary database to introduce new brands and products, offer promotions on select merchandise, highlight key events and announce new store openings.

Distribution
We distribute all of our store merchandise through a 126,000 square foot distribution facility co-located with our headquarters in Irvine, California. Our lease expires in December 2027. Extensive investments have been made to the distribution-center infrastructure, focused around systems automation, material-handling equipment, radio frequency technologies, and automated sorters in order to enhance our processing speed and long term scalability in support of our planned growth.
We also operate a dedicated e-commerce fulfillment center in Irvine, California to handle all e-commerce orders in a highly automated environment that leverages material handling equipment, automated systems and other technologies consistent with our current distribution facility. This investment supports our future e-commerce growth initiatives.
We ship merchandise to our stores multiple times per week, providing them with a steady flow of both new and replenishment products. Merchandise is shipped in a floor-ready format (carrying price tickets, sensor tags and with hangers where appropriate) which allows store employees to spend less time processing the merchandise and more time with our customers. We use our own fleet of trucks to ship merchandise to our Southern California stores and third-party distributors to ship merchandise to stores outside of our local area.
We believe our distribution and fulfillment infrastructure can support significant growth of our e-commerce platform and additional stores with minimal incremental capital investment.
Management Information Systems 
Our management information systems provide a full range of business process support and information to our store, merchandising, financial, real estate and other business teams. We selected, customized and integrated our information systems to enable and support our dynamic merchandise model. We believe our systems provide us with improved operational efficiencies, scalability, management control and timely reporting that allow us to identify and quickly respond to changes in our business. We believe that our information systems are scalable, flexible and have the capacity to accommodate our current growth plans.
During the fall of fiscal 2017, we began implementation of our new point-of-sale, order management, and customer relationship management systems through an end-to-end, cloud-based suite of technology additions that will improve the customer experience wherever, whenever and however our customers engage with us. We believe that these improvements will enhance our real-time inventory visibility and order management, facilitate seamless omni-channel execution integrated across mobile devices and stores, and true customer relations management capabilities. We believe this newly implemented technology will improve customer engagement and increase sales opportunities. Also during the fall of fiscal 2017, we re-platformed our website to a cloud-based, more cost effective solution and have plans to further upgrade our mobile application in advance of the fiscal 2018 holiday season. We believe the re-platforming of our website will improve functionality and reporting capabilities, reduce internal operating costs and effort for updates, and improve redundancy to better guard against system downtime. Both the new website platform and enhanced mobile application will be designed to function seamlessly with our new point-of-sale solution to provide an enhanced customer engagement.
Competition
The teenage and young adult retail apparel, accessories and footwear industry is highly competitive. We compete with other retailers for customers, store locations, store associates and management personnel. We currently compete with other teenage-focused retailers such as, but not limited to, Abercrombie & Fitch Co., Aeropostale, Inc., American Eagle Outfitters, Inc., The Buckle, Inc., Forever 21, Inc., Hot Topic, Inc., Pacific Sunwear of California, Inc., Urban Outfitters, Inc., and Zumiez, Inc. In addition, we compete with independent specialty shops, department stores, off-price retailers, online marketplaces such as Amazon, stores and websites operated by our third-party brands and direct marketers that sell similar lines of merchandise and target customers through catalogs and e-commerce. Further, we may face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets. Given the extensive number and types of retailers with which Tillys competes for customers, we believe that our target market is highly fragmented and we do not believe we have a significant share of this market.
12

Competition in our sector is based, among other things, upon merchandise offerings, store location, price and the ability to identify with the customer. We believe that we compete favorably with many of our competitors based on our differentiated merchandising strategy, store environment, flexible real estate strategy and company culture. However, many of our competitors are larger, have significantly more stores, and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Moreover, we recognize that we do not possess exclusive rights to many of the elements that comprise our in-store experience and product offerings. Our competitors can emulate facets of our business strategy and in-store experience, which could result in a reduction of any competitive advantage or special appeal that we might possess. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business. We face intense competition in our industry and we may not be able to compete effectively.”

However, the number of total employees, especially part-time employees, fluctuates depending upon our seasonal needs and, in fiscal year 2017, varied between approximately 4,700 and 7,100 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Government Regulation

We use insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee-related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by the employees. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to maintain adequate levels of coverage.
Seasonality
Due to the seasonal nature of the retail industry, we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our revenues and net income. Net revenues are typically smallest in the first quarter of a given fiscal year followed by sequentially increased net revenues in each succeeding quarter within a fiscal year. Our net sales fluctuate significantly in relation to various holidays and other peak shopping periods, including but not limited to the Thanksgiving and year-end holiday season, the back-to-school season, spring break periods, and other holidays. If, for any reason, our revenues were below seasonal norms or expectations during these quarters, particularly during peak selling periods, our annual results of operations could be adversely affected. The level of our working capital reflects the seasonality of our business. We expect inventory levels, along with an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, generally to reach their highest levels in anticipation of the increased revenues during these periods.
