ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
Overview
Lumentum Holdings Inc. (“we”, “our”, “Lumentum” or the “Company”) is an industry leading provider of optical and photonic products addressing a range of end market applications including data communications (“Datacom”) and telecommunications (“Telecom”) networking and commercial lasers (“commercial lasers”) for manufacturing, inspection and life-science applications, as defined by revenue and market share. In addition, we are using our core optical and photonic technology and our volume manufacturing capability to expand into emerging markets that benefit from advantages that optical or photonics-based solutions provide, including 3D sensing for consumer electronics and diode light sources for a variety of consumer and industrial applications. The majority of our customers are original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that incorporate our products into their products which address end-market applications. For example, we sell fiber optic components that our network equipment manufacturer (“NEM”) customers assemble into communications networking systems, which they sell to network service providers or enterprises with their own networks. Increasingly, we are also selling Datacom products to owners and operators of large data centers, which we refer to as hyperscale datacenters. Similarly, many of our customers for our Lasers products incorporate our products into tools they produce, which are used for manufacturing processes by their customers.
We operate in two reportable segments: Optical Communications (“OpComms”) and Commercial Lasers (“Lasers”).
We have a global marketing and sales footprint that enables us to address global market opportunities for our products. We have manufacturing capabilities and facilities in North America, Asia-Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) with employees engaged in R&D, administration, manufacturing, support and sales and marketing activities. Our headquarters are located in Milpitas, CA and we employed approximately 2,057 full-time employees around the world as of July 1, 2017.
Lumentum was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of JDS Uniphase Corporation (“JDSU”) on February 10, 2015 and is comprised of the former communications and commercial optical products (“CCOP”) segment and WaveReady product lines of JDSU. In August 2015, we became an independent publicly-traded company through the distribution by JDSU to its stockholders of 80.1% of our outstanding common stock (the “Separation”). Each JDSU stockholder of record as of the close of business on July 27, 2015 received one share of Lumentum common stock for every five shares of JDSU common stock held on such date. JDSU was renamed Viavi Solutions Inc. (“Viavi”) and at the time of distribution, retained ownership of 19.9% of Lumentum’s outstanding shares. 
Our business traces its origins to Uniphase Corporation, which was formed in 1979, and became publicly traded in 1992. Uniphase was originally a supplier of commercial lasers, and later, a leading supplier of optical transmission products. In 1999, JDS Fitel Inc., a pioneer in products for fiber optic networking which was formed in 1981, merged with Uniphase to become JDSU, a global leader in optical networking. Subsequent acquisitions by JDSU broadened the depth and breadth of the OpComms and Lasers businesses, as well as the intellectual property, technology and product offerings, of what is now Lumentum. Notable amongst these acquisitions in the OpComms business were Agility Communications, Inc. in 2005 and Picolight, Inc. in 2007 which respectively brought widely tunable, long wavelength laser technology for metro and long haul networking applications and short wavelength vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (“VCSELs”) for enterprise, datacenter networking, and 3D sensing applications. The fundamental laser component technologies which we acquired through these acquisitions, forms the basis of virtually all optical networks today and we believe will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. These technologies will enable us to develop highly integrated products to satisfy our communications customers’ ever increasing needs for smaller, lower power and lower cost optical products. Notable acquisitions in the Lasers business were Lightwave Electronics Corporation in 2005 and Time-Bandwidth Products Inc. (“Time-Bandwidth”) in 2014. Both of these Lasers acquisitions brought high power pulsed solid-state laser products and technology to our business which address the micro laser machining market and expanded our addressable market.
Industry Trends and Business Risks
Our business is driven by end-market applications which benefit from the performance advantages that optical solutions enable.
3

The OpComms markets we serve are experiencing continually increasing needs for higher data transmission speeds, fiber optic network capacity and network agility. This is driven by rapid growth in both the number of higher bandwidth broadband connections, notably those associated with mobile devices, such as high-definition video, online gaming, cloud computing and the number and scale of datacenters that require fiber optic links to enable the higher speeds and increased scale necessary to deliver high bandwidth video and other services. Our technology, which was originally developed for communications applications is also finding use in other emerging market opportunities including 3D sensing applications that employ our laser technology in mobile devices, computers, augmented and virtual reality and other consumer electronics devices. 
In the Lasers markets, customer demand is driven by the need to enable faster, higher precision volume manufacturing techniques with lower power consumption, reduced manufacturing footprint and increased productivity. These capabilities are critical as industries develop products that are smaller and lighter, increasing productivity and yield and lowering their energy consumption. 
Our optical and laser solutions, developed in close collaboration with OEM partners, are well positioned to meet demand resulting from these trends. We do, however, expect to continue to encounter a number of industry and market risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may limit our visibility, and consequently, our ability to predict future revenue, profitability and general financial performance, and could create quarter over quarter variability in our financial measures. For example, the demand environment in China has fluctuated significantly over the past year, and has created volatility and uncertainty in our future demand. We cannot predict when or to what extent these uncertainties will be resolved. Our revenues, profitability and general financial performance may also be affected by: (i) pricing pressures, particularly within our OpComms markets, due to, among other things, a highly concentrated customer base, increasing competition, particularly from Asia-Pacific-based competitors, and a general commoditization trend for certain products; (ii) high product mix variability which affects revenue and gross margin; (iii) fluctuations in customer buying patterns, which cause volatility in demand, revenue and profitability; and (iv) the current trend of communication industry consolidation, which is expected to continue, that directly affects our customer bases and adds additional risk and uncertainty to our financial and business projections.
Reportable Segments
We are an industry leading provider of optical and photonic products defined by revenue and market share addressing a range of end-market applications including optical communications and commercial lasers. We have two operating segments, Optical Communications, which we refer to as OpComms, and Commercial Lasers, which we refer to as Lasers. The two operating segments were primarily determined based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and to assess their performance. Other factors, including market separation and customer specific applications, go-to-market channels, products and manufacturing, are considered in determining the formation of these operating segments.
The table below discloses the percentage of our total net revenue attributable to our two reportable segments. In addition, it discloses the percentage of our total net revenue attributable to product offerings within the OpComms segment:

OpComms
Markets
Our OpComms products address the following markets: telecommunications (Telecom), data communications (Datacom) and Consumer and Industrial.
Our OpComms products include a wide range of components, modules and subsystems to support and maintain customers in our two primary markets: Telecom and Datacom. The Telecom market includes carrier networks for access (local), metro (intracity), long-haul (city-to-city and worldwide) and submarine (undersea) networks. The Datacom market addresses enterprise, 
4

cloud and data center applications, including storage-access networks (“SANs”), local-area networks (“LANs”) and wide-area networks (“WANs”). These products enable the transmission and transport of video, audio and text data over high-capacity fiber-optic cables. We maintain leading positions in the fast growing OpComms markets, including reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (“ROADMs”), tunable 10-gigabit small form-factor pluggable transceivers and tunable small form-factor pluggable transceivers. Our 10G, 40G legacy transceivers and a growing portfolio of 100G pluggable transceivers support LAN/SAN/WAN needs and the cloud for customers building enterprise and hyperscale data center networks.
In the Consumer and Industrial markets, our OpComms products include laser light sources, which are integrated into 3D sensing platforms being used in applications for mobile devices, gaming, computers, virtual and augmented reality, other consumer electronics devices, and industrial segments. These systems simplify the way people interact with technology by enabling the use of natural body gestures, like the wave of a hand, to control a product or application. Systems can also be used for identification, safety, and process efficiency, among numerous other application spaces. Emerging applications for this technology include various mobile device applications, autonomous vehicles, self-navigating robotics and drones in industrial applications and 3D capture of objects coupled with 3D printing. Our laser light sources are also used in a variety of other industrial laser and processing applications.

Trends 
To remain competitive, network operators worldwide must offer broader suites of digital services. To do this, they are migrating to Internet-protocol (“IP”) networks and expanding long-haul, metro regional and metro access networks, which effectively deliver broadband services while lowering capital and operating costs of dense-wavelength-division multiplexing networks. 
The growing demand for capacity encourages the adoption of OpComms products across the Datacom and Telecom markets. Demand for capacity in the Datacom market is driven by the growing needs of LANs and WANs. Growth in Datacom is also driven by web and cloud services companies that are expanding data center infrastructure, increasing the need for network capacity within and between these data centers. 
Demand in the Telecom market is driven by new bandwidth-intensive applications that can result in sudden and severe changes in demand almost anywhere on the network. Increasing agility in optical networks by employing ROADMs, wavelength selective switches, wavelength tunable transmission products and other agile optical products provides an effective way to respond to unpredictable bandwidth demands and to manage expenses. With more agile optical networks, a network operator can add capacity by using remote management applications rather than dispatching technicians to perform manual operations in the field. 
In addition, the high-end routers, switches and cross-connect equipment that must handle legacy and internet-protocol traffic are becoming increasingly complex in order to meet higher bandwidth, scalability, speed and reliability needs. Products must provide higher levels of functionality and performance in compact designs that must also meet requirements for quality, reliability and cost. 
Deployment of fiber closer to the end user increases the availability of high-bandwidth services and we expect it will result in increased demand on the metro regional and long-haul networks into which these services feed. The dynamically reconfigurable nature of today’s agile networks enables lower operating costs and other competitive advantages, allowing service providers to use and scale network capacity more flexibly, streamline service provisioning, accelerate rerouting around points of failure and modify network topology through simple point-and-click network management systems. 
5

Our optical products are well positioned to meet these demands. Our innovation has resulted in products that have more functionality, are less than half the size, require less power and are more cost-effective, particularly in the area of photonic integrated circuits. Higher levels of integration have also led to development of our Super Transport Blade, which delivers all transport functions (wavelength switching, pre-amplification, post-amplification, optical supervisory channel and monitoring) in a single, integrated platform, essentially replacing three blades with one. 
Strategy 
In our OpComms segment, we are focused on technology leadership through collaborative innovation with our customers, cost leadership and functional integration. We align the latest technologies with industry leading, scalable manufacturing and operations to drive the next phase of optical communications for Telecom and Datacom applications that are faster, more agile and more reliable, making us a valuable business and technology partner for NEMs, consumer electronic companies, cloud service providers and data center operators. 
Competition 
We compete against various public and private companies in the markets we serve. Publicly traded companies providing optical communications components include II-VI , Acacia Communications, Foxconn Interconnect Technology, Finisar, Fujitsu Optical Components, Furukawa Electric, Neophotonics, Oclaro, Applied Optoelectronic, Innolight Technology, and Sumitomo Electric Industries.
Offerings 
In addition to a full selection of active and passive components, we offer increasing levels of functionality and integration in modules, circuit packs and subsystems for transmission, amplification, wavelength management and more. 
In the Telecom market, we provide transmission and transport solutions for optical networks that make up the backbone of the wireline Telecom infrastructure, thereby enabling the internet. Transmission products, such as our tunable transponder, transceiver and transmitter modules, transmit and receive high-speed data signals at the ingress/egress points of the network. These products use dense wavelength division multiplexing technology to enable high capacity (from 20 to 40Tb/s in the C-Band) links driven by increasing internet demand. We also offer components including tunable lasers, receivers and modulators to address the higher end of these same network applications. 
Our transport products, such as ROADMs, amplifiers and optical channel monitors provide switching, routing and conditioning of signals. We also make components for transport, including 980nm, multi-mode and Raman pumps for optical amplifiers, and passive components. Passive components include switches, attenuators, photodetectors, gain flattening filters, isolators, WDM filters, AWG’s, multiplex/de-multiplexers and integrated passive modules. 
Our innovation led to the Super Transport Blade, which integrates all major optical transport functions into a single-slot blade. This all-in-one solution reduces the size, cost and power requirements of optical components, incorporates nano wavelength selective switch technology and enables greater chassis density and a smaller footprint. 
In the Datacom market, which relies on storing, moving and manipulating vast amounts of data, we offer transmission products, such as our optical transceivers for Fiber Channel and Ethernet applications. Our transceivers are also used to connect servers, switches, routers and other information technology infrastructure critical for today’s email, enterprise resource planning and other cloud services such as streaming of high definition and 4k video. 
Our integrated fiber optic transceivers provide cost effective and scalable connectivity and are used in the hardware that runs many of the applications people use daily such as email, social networking, cloud storage, online gaming and streaming video. They are available in several hot-pluggable form factors and allow for very compact, high-density hardware designs. 
For the high 100G data rate, we offer several technologies to balance technical and commercial requirements. For high volume, short distance applications we developed our vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (“VCSELs”). VCSELs are ideal for short reaches because they are low power consumption, low cost and highly scalable. For high-performance, longer distance applications we have our distributed feedback laser (“DFB”) and electro-absorption modulated laser (“EML”). Our individual lasers and compact laser arrays offer an innovative solution for the LANs, SANs, broadband Internet and metro-area network as well as hyperscale datacenter applications. 
Our 3D sensing technology enables real time depth information to any photo or video image. This represents a fundamental transition for image capture akin to the transition from monochrome to color and gives devices the ability to see the world around them in three dimensions. The immediate applications include full body imaging for gaming, 3D scanning for space mapping and facial recognition for security. Emerging applications are in mobile devices, computers, augmented and virtual reality and other consumer electronics devices, automotive, robotics and industrial. 3D sensing can be applied to any device with a camera. The 
6

technologies to achieve accurate and stable 3D sensing are converging to laser based solutions. We are a leading supplier of the critical laser illumination sources for 3D sensing systems being used in applications for gaming, computing, mobile devices and home entertainment. 
Lasers
Markets
Our Lasers products serve our customers in markets and applications such as sheet metal processing, general manufacturing, biotechnology, graphics and imaging, remote sensing, and precision machining such as drilling in printed circuit boards, wafer singulation, glass cutting and solar cell scribing.
Our Lasers products are used in a variety of original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) applications including diode-pumped solid-state, fiber, diode, direct-diode and gas lasers such as argon-ion and helium-neon lasers. Fiber lasers provide kW-class output powers combined with excellent beam quality and are used in sheet metal processing and metal welding applications. Diode-pumped solid-state lasers provide excellent beam quality, low noise and exceptional reliability and are used in biotechnology, graphics and imaging, remote sensing, materials processing and precision machining applications. Diode and direct-diode lasers address a wide variety of applications, including laser pumping, thermal exposure, illumination, ophthalmology, image recording, printing, plastic welding and selective soldering. Gas lasers such as argon-ion and helium-neon lasers provide a stable, low-cost and reliable solution over a wide range of operating conditions, making them well suited for complex, high-resolution OEM applications such as flow cytometry, DNA sequencing, graphics and imaging and semiconductor inspection.
Our acquisition of Time-Bandwidth enabled us to provide high-powered and ultrafast lasers for the industrial and scientific markets. Manufacturers use high-power, ultrafast lasers to create micro parts for consumer electronics and to process semiconductor, LED, and other types of chips. Use of ultrafast lasers for micromachining applications is being driven primarily by the increasing use of consumer electronics and connected devices globally.
Our portfolio of Lasers products includes components and subsystems used in a variety of OEM applications that range in output power from milliwatts to kilowatts and include ultraviolet, visible and infrared wavelengths. We support customer applications in the biotechnology, graphics and imaging, remote sensing, materials processing and other precision machining areas. 
Customers 
Our Lasers customers include Amada, ASML Holding, Beckman Coulter, Becton, Dickinson and Company, DISCO, Electro Scientific Industries, EO Technics, and KLA-Tencor. During fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, we did not have any single customer attributable to our Lasers segment that generated net revenue of 10% or more of our total net revenue of the applicable fiscal year.
Trends 
As technology advances, industries such as consumer electronics manufacturing increasingly turn to lasers when they need more precision, higher productivity and energy efficient, or “green,” alternatives for problems that cannot be solved by mechanical, electronic or other means. For example, these industries are using lasers to develop products that are smaller and lighter to increase productivity and yield and to lower their energy consumption. Lasers have been used for years to help achieve the scale and precision needed in semiconductor processing. In biotech applications, lasers have been instrumental for advances (and new standard procedures) in cytology, hematology, genome sequencing and crime scene investigations, among others. We believe the long-term trends in these industries will likely lead to increased demand for lasers. 
Sheet metal processing and metal welding applications are increasingly using kW-class fiber lasers instead of kW-class CO2 lasers. Fiber lasers generate higher productivity at lower cost in such applications because they exhibit lower power consumption, better quality and generally lower user maintenance costs.
In addition, demand continues for electronic products, as well as products and components in other industries, with greater functionality while becoming smaller, lighter and less expensive. Innovative / Next generation product designs require precise micromachining and materials processing, such as micro bending, soldering and welding. At the scale and processing speed needed, lasers are replacing mature mechanical tools such as drills for minute holes, or “vias,” in printed circuit boards and saws and scribes for singulating silicon wafers, resulting in greater precision and productivity. As these trends continue, we believe that manufacturers and other industries will increase their reliance on lasers in order to maintain or increase their competitiveness. 
We believe we are well-positioned with key OEM providers of laser solutions to these industries. We continue to develop our laser portfolio to offer smaller and more cost-effective products designed specifically for the performance, integration, reliability and support needs of our OEM customers.

Restructuring Programs
We continue to engage in targeted restructuring plans primarily intended to reduce costs, consolidate our operations, rationalize the manufacturing of our products and align our business in response to market needs. We have focused on improving efficiencies and reducing costs by consolidating operations where appropriate, while taking into consideration our current investment strategy, product offerings, core competencies, opportunities to enhance cost efficiency and the availability of alternative manufacturers, as appropriate. 
Please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Note 14. Restructuring and Related Charges” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on restructuring charges. 
Research and Development
During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we incurred R&D expenses of $148.3 million, $141.1 million and $140.8 million, respectively. The number of employees engaged in R&D was approximately 598 as of July 1, 2017, 570 as of July 2, 2016 and 550 as of June 27, 2015.
We devote substantial resources to R&D for the development of new and enhanced products to serve our markets. Once the design of a product is complete, our engineering efforts shift to enhancing both product performance and our ability to manufacture it in greater volume and at lower cost.
In our OpComms segment, we are maintaining our capability to provide products throughout the network, while focusing on several important sub-segments. We are increasing our emphasis on Datacom products, such as 100G and 400G transceivers while we continue to maintain strong investments in Telecom components and modules such as ROADMs and tunable devices needed for long-haul and metro markets. We are also responding to our customers’ requests for higher levels of integration, including the integration of optics, electronics and software in our modules, subsystems and circuit packs. We are providing optical technology for 3D sensing systems that simplify the way that people interact with technology. These solutions are initially being used in computing, mobile, and industrial applications, including automotive applications.
In our Lasers segment, we continue to develop new product offerings in both solid-state and fiber lasers that take advantage of technologies and components we develop. These products are targeted at serving customers engaging in biotechnology, graphics and imaging, remote sensing, and materials processing and precision micromachining markets.
Manufacturing
Our significant manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, Thailand, and Switzerland. In March 2017, we completed the purchase of a property in Thailand for additional manufacturing capacity for our future growth. 
Our significant contract manufacturing partners are located primarily in Thailand, Taiwan and China. Contract manufacturers can save a significant amount of dollars on labor, material and other related production expenses. We rely on the capabilities of our contract manufactures to procure the components and manage the inventory in these locations.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
We use various suppliers and contract manufacturers to supply parts and components for the manufacture and support of multiple product lines. Although our intention is to establish at least two sources of supply for materials whenever possible, for certain components we have sole or limited source supply arrangements. We may not be able to procure these components from alternative sources at acceptable prices and quality within a reasonable time, or at all; therefore, the risk of loss or interruption of such arrangements could impact our ability to deliver certain products on a timely basis.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property rights that apply to our various products include patents, trade secrets and trademarks. We do not intend to broadly license our intellectual property rights unless we can obtain adequate consideration or enter into acceptable patent cross-license agreements. As of July 1, 2017, we own 681 U.S. patents and 241 foreign patents with expiration dates ranging from 2017 through 2035, and have 153 patent applications pending throughout the world.
9

Seasonality
Our revenue may be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by customer demand patterns and new product introductions. Some of our products may be incorporated into consumer electronic products, which are subject to seasonality and fluctuations in demand.
Backlog
Backlog consists of purchase orders for products for which we have assigned shipment dates. 
As of July 1, 2017, our backlog was $218.4 million, as compared to $168.5 million as of July 2, 2016. Due to possible changes in product delivery schedules and cancellation of product orders, and because our sales often reflect orders shipped in the same quarter in which they are received, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue or the level of orders for any succeeding period.
Employees
As of July 1, 2017, we employed approximately 2,057 full-time employees including approximately 1,084 employees in manufacturing, 598 employees in R&D and 375 employees in SG&A. 
Outside of the United States, our business is subject to labor laws that differ from those in the United States. We follow the statutory requirements of those countries where we operate. We consider our employee relations to be good. 
Environmental
Our R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the United States, even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future.
In connection with the Separation, we agreed to indemnify Viavi for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred to us from Viavi, to the extent the resulting issues primarily related to our business.
International Operations
During fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, net revenue from customers outside the United States based on the geographic region and country where our product is initially shipped, represented 85.2%, 82% and 80.6% of net revenue, respectively. In certain circumstances customers may request shipment of our products to a contract manufacturer in one country, which may differ from the location of their end customers. During fiscal 2017, our net revenue from Hong Kong, Mexico and Japan represented 22.6%, 18.5% and 9.9% of our consolidated net revenue, respectively. During fiscal 2016, our net revenue from Hong Kong, Mexico, and Japan represented 23.7%, 12.5% and 10.3% of our consolidated net revenue, respectively. During fiscal 2015, our net revenue from Hong Kong, Mexico and Japan represented 14.4%, 13.5% and 12.7% of our consolidated net revenue, respectively. Our net revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, including our net revenue from customers outside the United States based on customer shipment locations as presented above.
As of July 1, 2017 and July 2, 2016, long-lived assets, namely our net property, plant and equipment, located outside of the United States comprised 67.8% and 62.4% of our total property, plant and equipment, net, respectively. As of July 1, 2017, 30.1% and 31.2% of our net property, plant and equipment were located in China and Thailand, respectively. As of July 2, 2016, 25.4% and 23.9% of our net property, plant and equipment were located in China and Thailand, respectively.
