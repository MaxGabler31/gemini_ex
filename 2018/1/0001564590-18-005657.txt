Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 We are an innovative, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery and development of novel therapeutics to treat cystic fibrosis, or CF, and other diseases caused by an imbalance in the proteostasis network, a set of pathways that control protein biosynthesis, folding, trafficking and clearance. The Company focuses on identifying therapies that restore protein function. CF is a disease caused by defects in the function or abundance of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR. Our CF focused pipeline consists of novel CFTR modulators including correctors, potentiators and amplifiers. Upon discovery of amplifiers, a novel class of CFTR modulators, we have exploited its novel mechanism of action as a drug screening tool and have subsequently identified correctors and potentiators to be developed as part of combination therapies. Investigational agents representative of all three classes of CFTR modulators are currently in clinical development and include PTI-428, an amplifier, and PTI-801 a third generation corrector, both of which we believe are amenable for add-on therapy to standard-of-care CFTR modulator treatment and PTI-808, a potentiator intended to be developed as part of a dual combination with PTI-801 and a triple combination that also includes PTI-428 and PTI-801. We are developing and, if approved, intend to commercialize our own therapies, including add-on and combination therapies for CF patients who have at least one F508del mutation, representing the majority of the patient population. 
 There is presently no cure for CF. CF affects an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 patients worldwide with the vast majority of the diagnosed patients residing in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. CF is a progressive disease and the most common fatal inherited disease among Caucasians. Without normal CFTR protein activity, thick mucus accumulates in vital organs, particularly the lungs, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract, and causes many complications, including respiratory infections, chronic lung inflammation, poor absorption of nutrients and in most cases, progressive respiratory failure. CF patients require lifelong treatment with multiple daily medications, hours of self-care, and frequent hospitalizations. In 2016, the median age of death in the United States from CF was 30 years. 
 The approval of CFTR modulator based therapy, consisting of a potentiator and a combination of a potentiator and a corrector, has validated the clinical benefit of a small molecule pharmacological approach to improve CFTR function and has become a standard of care for eligible CF patients. These developments have spurred drug discovery and development initiatives that include a combinational approach of multiple modulators. To our knowledge there are only two pharmaceutical companies currently developing combined uses of three CFTR modulators whose goal is the restoration of CFTR protein activity in CF patients by using one potentiator and two corrector molecules. Correctors, such as lumacaftor or tezacaftor, are believed to improve protein folding and trafficking to enable abnormally folded CFTR protein to achieve a higher level of activity without repairing the actual protein mutation. Potentiators, such as ivacaftor, are believed to increase the opening time of the CFTR protein channel resulting in higher ion flow across the cell membrane.
 Unlike other triple combination drug discovery and development approaches for CF that are based on potentiators and correctors, our program includes PTI-428, an amplifier, a novel CFTR modulator with unique and distinguished molecular properties. PTI-428 is an orally bioavailable CFTR modulator belonging to the amplifier class. CFTR modulators are compounds that affect the folding, trafficking, function and clearance of CFTR protein and can be classified according to the ways in which they affect CFTR protein. Amplifiers, which include PTI-428, are CFTR modulators that selectively increase the amount of the newly synthesized unfolded form of CFTR protein, thereby providing additional substrate for other CFTR modulators, such as correctors and potentiators, to act upon. Using industry-standard in vitro studies, we have demonstrated that co-administration of PTI-428 with correctors and potentiators significantly improves the in vitro CFTR protein activity achieved by these CFTR modulators alone.

Due to the unique ability of amplifiers to selectively increase the amount of the unfolded form of CFTR protein and its synergistic mechanism of action with certain other types of CFTR modulators, we believe that PTI-428 could become the anchor therapeutic agent for combination therapies comprising multiple classes of CFTR modulators for the treatment of CF. A triple combination regimen that includes PTI-428 with PTI-801, a corrector, and PTI-808, a potentiator, has been shown to restore in vitro CFTR protein activity to approximately 100% of normal, in patient-derived human bronchial epithelial, or HBE, cells homozygous for F508del.
 With the recent advent of CFTR modulators, the CF treatment paradigm is shifting from palliative care, which addresses only the symptoms of CF, to disease-modifying agents that target the genetic cause of the disease or the mutated CFTR protein. We are developing and, if approved, intend to commercialize a proprietary combination therapy for patients with an F508del mutation of the CFTR gene, the most common CFTR gene mutation. In the United States, approximately 86% of all CF patients have an F508del mutation of the CFTR gene, of which approximately 53% are homozygous (having two copies of the F508del mutation), and approximately 47% are heterozygous (having an F508del mutation and one other mutation). 
 We and others have analyzed published data by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Vertex, on its CFTR modulators (the potentiator ivacaftor and the correctors lumacaftor and tezacaftor) and combinations thereof, which show a strong correlation between the in vitro CFTR protein activity and lung function improvement. We have shown in vitro that PTI-428 increases the amount of available CFTR protein and, when combined with ivacaftor and either lumacaftor or tezacaftor, nearly doubles the CFTR protein activity in the cell compared to a combination of only ivacaftor and either lumacaftor or tezacaftor. In December 2015, the investigational new drug application, or IND, that we submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate our PTI-428 product candidate became effective. We initiated our first Phase 1 clinical trial in CF patients and healthy volunteers in the first half of 2016. The Phase 1 trial in CF patients included single ascending dose, or SAD, and multiple ascending dose, or MAD, cohorts. The Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers included SAD and MAD cohorts to assess the safety, pharmacokinetic and exploratory biomarker results. We reported preliminary safety, pharmacokinetic and exploratory biomarker data from SAD and MAD cohorts in the PTI-428 Phase 1 clinical trial in CF subjects receiving PTI-428 or placebo for 7 days in addition to Orkambi® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) as their background, standard of care therapy, as well as a cohort of CF subjects receiving PTI-428 or placebo for 7 days who were not taking CFTR modulator based therapies. 
 We have completed a 28-day Phase 2 clinical trial for PTI-428 in CF patients randomized to receive either PTI-428 or placebo for 28 days in addition to Orkambi® as their background, standard of care therapy to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 50 mg of once-a-day PTI-428. In December of 2017, we announced the results of the study which showed that the addition of PTI-428 to Orkambi® demonstrated mean absolute improvements in ppFEV1 of 5.2 percentage points from baseline compared to placebo (p≤0.05), with mean relative improvements of 9.2 percent (p≤0.05). This treatment effect was achieved by day 14 and sustained through 28 days of dosing.
 In CF subjects on Orkambi® therapy, it has been shown in two registrational Phase 3 studies that the magnitude of response to Orkambi varied according to patient lung function at screening suggesting that the overall efficacy captured in these studies was mainly driven by the subgroup with baseline ppFEV1 below 70% (+3.3 percentage points) while the changes in the group with FEV1 ≥70% were not statistically significant. A similar analysis was performed in our 28-day study with PTI-428 and it showed an average +6.6 percentage points (p<0.05) increase in absolute ppFEV1 compared to placebo for patients who had lower baseline ppFEV1 value (<70%). The results of the subgroup analysis are consistent with Phase 3 data with Orkambi®, suggesting that PTI-428 potentially amplifies the Orkambi® effect in the responder population.
 Additional endpoints in the study included measurement of changes in sweat chloride (secondary endpoint) and CFTR expression in nasal epithelia (exploratory endpoint). In this study, a positive increase in CFTR protein from baseline was observed in PTI-428 treated subjects and the magnitude of change was consistent with the changes in CFTR protein levels observed in an in vitro human bronchial cell (HBE) cell model.  In contrast, changes in sweat chloride did not correlate with changes in lung function.

In the 28-day study, PTI-428 was generally well tolerated and lacked clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions with ivacaftor and lumacaftor. Fourteen of 20 subjects receiving PTI-428 and two of four subjects receiving placebo experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event. There were no serious adverse events, or SAEs, and there were two adverse events, or AEs, that led to study discontinuation. Both cases were thrombocytopenia of mild grade and comparable magnitude and value. One occurred while a subject was on Orkambi® only and one in a subject receiving PTI-428 with both subjects resolving spontaneously.
 In March 2018, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for PTI-428 for the treatment of CF in homozygous patients for the F508del mutation who are receiving Orkambi® as background therapy.  The designation was based on the FDA’s review of available clinical evidence, including the observed increase in FEV1 and CFTR protein levels in the 28-day study.  Breakthrough Therapy designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). Also in March 2018, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation for PTI-428. The FDA grants orphan designation to promote the development of product candidates for rare conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 U.S. patients annually. This designation provides for a seven-year marketing exclusivity period against competition, as well as certain incentives, including federal grants, tax credits and a waiver of certain administrative filing fees.  
 Our IND for the Phase 1 study of PTI-801, a corrector molecule, was submitted to the FDA in the first quarter of 2017 and is now active. In March 2017, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the investigation of PTI-801 for the treatment of CF. We completed dosing of subjects in the key SAD and MAD cohorts of the healthy volunteer portion of this study, to assess the safety and PK of PTI-801, and reported initial data on this portion of the study in 2017. 
 We have initiated a 14-day once-a-day dosing study with PTI-801 in CF subjects on background Orkambi® therapy. In December of 2017, we reported initial data from a preliminary ad hoc analysis of the first five subjects (four PTI-801 treated and one placebo) of the first dose level tested.  All four subjects who received once-a-day 100 mg of PTI-801 completed two weeks of dosing. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile observed from these four subjects was consistent with the PK profile observed for healthy volunteers. These initial data also showed no clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions with either lumacaftor or ivacaftor.  There were no serious adverse safety events reported that were considered as possibly drug related.  Mean absolute improvements in ppFEV1 of approximately 4 percentage points from baseline, with mean relative improvements of approximately 7 percent, were observed in the four PTI-801 subjects who completed two weeks of dosing. This study, designed to investigate the effect of PTI-801 in escalating doses in multiple cohorts, is ongoing. 
 Our IND for the Phase 1 study of PTI-808, a potentiator molecule, was submitted to the FDA in the second quarter of 2017 and is now active. PTI-808 has completed investigation in 48 healthy volunteers with up to 300 mg in single and multiple dose cohorts. PTI-808 was found to be generally well tolerated.  One subject experienced a serious adverse event from a pre-existing condition of transverse myelitis. This serious adverse event was considered unlikely to be related to the study drug. No adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment were reported.  All other adverse events that have been reported to date were of mild or moderate severity. Preliminary PK assessment of PTI-808 suggests that it could potentially be suitable for once daily dosing. 
 Co-administration of PTI-428, PTI-808 and PTI-801 has been completed in 20 healthy volunteer subjects.  Safety and PK profiles achieved with seven days of once-a-day oral dosing of PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 indicated these compounds were generally well-tolerated and could potentially be amenable for once a day dosing. No SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment were reported.  The PK data demonstrated a lack of clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions.  
 Combination study protocols for trials in CF patients have been reviewed by key patient advocacy and regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe. In January of 2018, we announced that our triple combination clinical study protocol received endorsement and a high strategic fit score from the Therapeutics Development Network (TDN) and the Clinical Trial Network (CTN). Our double combination protocol has also received the endorsement of the TDN. The TDN and CTN are the drug development arms of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and the European CF Society (ECFS), respectively.
 In 2018, we aim to (1) produce additional data from our 14-day study of PTI-801 in CF patients on background Orkambi in the first half, (2) continue dosing CF patients in a double combination trial consisting of 
 3


PTI-801 and PTI-808, and produce initial data by mid-year, (3) initiate a triple combination of our proprietary agents PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 in CF patients in the first half, and produce preliminary data in the second half and (4) initiate a clinical study with PTI-428 in patients on background Symdeko in the second half with initial data in early 2019. 
 We have exclusive worldwide commercial rights to PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808, as well as our proprietary combinations. We plan to pursue regulatory approval for add-on therapies based on PTI-428 and/or PTI-801 in regions where ivacaftor and lumacaftor (and ivacaftor and tezacaftor, as applicable) are commercially available. Given the well-characterized and clearly identified patient populations with CF in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia, we plan to independently commercialize PTI-428 and/or PTI-801 in those regions. Our commercialization strategy will target key prescribing physicians and advocacy groups, as well as provide patients with support programs, ensure product access and secure reimbursement. 
 In addition to our wholly owned CF programs, we have partnered with a major pharmaceutical company, Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, on our unfolded protein response, or UPR, program. The UPR program is intended to reduce the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, or ER, which is observed in many diseases caused by an imbalance in the proteostasis network and characterized by defects in protein folding, trafficking and clearance, including genetic, neurodegenerative and retinal degenerative diseases. In August 2016, we announced the achievement of a preclinical milestone by demonstrating that selective modulation of the UPR pathway is an effective disease-modifying approach in the treatment of multiple diseases with few or no therapies currently available. 
 Strategy 
 Our mission is to improve the lives of patients who suffer from rare diseases for which there are limited or no available treatments, with an initial therapeutic focus on CF. To accomplish our objectives, we intend to: 

• | Develop our own proprietary combination product candidates, including a triple combination (PTI-428, PTI-801, PTI-808) and a double combination (PTI-801 and PTI-808), to address a broad spectrum of CFTR gene mutations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have identified novel correctors and potentiators that, when combined with an amplifier, have restored in vitro CFTR protein activity to approximately 100% of normal in cells homozygous for F508del. We have nominated PTI-801, a corrector molecule, and PTI-808, a potentiator molecule, as drug development candidates that, when combined with PTI-428, are active components of our triple combination. All three compounds have active INDs under FDA and we have completed co-administration of our triple combination consisting of PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 in healthy volunteers. Additionally, PTI-428 has completed a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers and CF patients, as well as a Phase 2 study in CF patients stable on Orkambi. Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers have been completed for PTI-801 and PTI-808 and exploration of PTI-801 in CF patients on background Orkambi are underway.
  
o | Triple Combination. We believe that the treatment paradigm in CF for the vast majority of patients could be based on combination therapies of CFTR modulators anchored by PTI-428. Subject to positive results from our PTI-801 program, we aim to initiate dosing of our triple combination in CF patients in the first half of 2018 with preliminary data expected in the second half of 2018. More specifically, we expect that the PTI-808 study will explore ascending doses of PTI-808 in CF patients homozygous for F508del not taking Orkambi or Symdeko and who are also receiving PTI-428 and PTI-801. The TDN and CTN have endorsed the protocol for our triple combination and have assigned it a high strategic fit score. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Double Combination. In addition, we have commenced dosing CF patients for a double combination study consisting of PTI-801 and PTI-808, and plan to produce initial data by mid-year 2018. In vitro data in patient cells showed that the combination of PTI-801 and PTI-808 restored CFTR protein activity to levels beyond those observed in cells from healthy carriers. The TDN has endorsed the protocol for our double combination. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Rapidly advance clinical development of PTI-801 and PTI-428 as potential add-on therapies to existing and possible future standard of care CFTR modulator therapies by conducting additional studies to support a registrational path as add-on options.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In vitro data showed that our proprietary amplifier PTI-428 and our corrector PTI-801 synergize with currently available CFTR modulator combinations ivacaftor/lumacaftor and ivacaftor/tezacaftor, approved as Orkambi and Symdeko, respectively, suggesting that they may provide additional therapeutic benefit in CF subjects who take the approved products as their standard of care.
  
o | PTI-801 as Add-on. In the first quarter of 2017, we filed an IND for our proprietary corrector, PTI-801, which is now active. In March 2017, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the investigation of PTI-801 for the treatment of CF. We completed dosing of subjects in the key SAD and MAD cohorts of the healthy volunteer portion of this study, to assess the safety and PK of PTI-801, and reported initial data on this portion of the study in 2017. In December of 2017, we shared initial data from a preliminary ad hoc analysis of the first five subjects (four PTI-801 treated and 1 placebo) of the first dose level tested in the 14-day dosing study of PTI-801 in CF patients on background Orkambi® therapy. All four subjects who received once-a-day 100 mg of PTI-801 completed two weeks of dosing. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile observed from these four subjects was consistent with the PK profile observed for healthy volunteers. These initial data also showed no clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions with either lumacaftor or ivacaftor. There were no serious adverse safety events reported that were considered as possibly drug related. Mean absolute improvements in ppFEV1 of approximately 4 percentage points from baseline, with mean relative improvements of approximately 7 percent, were observed in the four PTI-801 subjects who completed two weeks of dosing. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | PTI-428 as Add-on. We have shown that PTI-428, combined with ivacaftor and either lumacaftor or tezacaftor, nearly doubles in vitro CFTR protein activity in cells homozygous for F508del compared to a combination of only ivacaftor and either lumacaftor or tezacaftor. We completed the Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers which included SAD and MAD cohorts to assess the safety, pharmacokinetic and exploratory biomarker results. In December of 2017, we announced the completion of a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 50 mg once-a-day PTI-428 over a 28-day treatment period with CF patients on background Orkambi® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and we plan to initiate a clinical study with PTI-428 in subjects on background Symdeko in the second half of this year. In March 2018, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for PTI-428 for the treatment of CF in homozygous patients for the F508del mutation who are receiving Orkambi® as background therapy. Also in March 2018, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation for PTI-428. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The addition of PTI-428 to Orkambi® demonstrated mean absolute improvements in ppFEV1 of 5.2 percentage points from baseline compared to placebo (p≤0.05), with mean relative improvements of 9.2 percent (p≤0.05). This treatment effect was achieved by day 14 and sustained through 28 days of dosing. In the 28-day study, PTI-428 was generally well tolerated and lacked clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions with ivacaftor and lumacaftor. Fourteen of 20 subjects receiving PTI-428 and two of four subjects receiving placebo experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event. There were no serious adverse events and there were 2 adverse events that led to study discontinuation. Both cases were thrombocytopenia of mild grade and comparable magnitude and value. One occurred while a subject was on Orkambi® only and one in a subject receiving PTI-428 with both subjects resolving spontaneously. We plan to generate additional evidence supporting the use of PTI-428 in combination with other CFTR modulators and broaden the patient population beyond the initially targeted F508del homozygous subjects. Based on preclinical studies to date, PTI-428, in combination with other CFTR modulators, has shown a consistent positive effect on in vitro CFTR protein activity across multiple CFTR gene mutation classes.

• | Generate highly selective drug candidates in CF and other diseases caused by dysfunctional protein processing by leveraging our knowledge of small molecules that could help restore protein function and of the proteostasis network. We are focused on developing drugs based on our unique and comprehensive expertise regarding agents that could help restore protein function, the proteostasis network and its role in protein biosynthesis, folding, trafficking and clearance. We believe that this expertise will enable us to identify and develop drug candidates that are transformative for diseases caused by dysfunctional protein processing. In CF, we are exploiting the mechanism of action of PTI-428 which enhances the yield of HTS of small molecule libraries and has enabled the identification of several novel proprietary CFTR modulators. We plan to continue to run HTS campaigns to continue to discover novel drug candidates for diseases caused by dysfunctional protein processing, including diseases where amplifiers can have a clinically meaningful impact.

• | Enter into additional collaborative partnerships to develop and commercialize novel compounds in indications outside of our key strategic areas. Our existing corporate alliance with Astellas provides for future aggregate milestone payments of up to approximately $400 million. We plan to enter into other arrangements that leverage our expertise. Partnership opportunities will be screened and evaluated based on their potential to generate additional value by giving us a stake in the resulting products’ future revenues and to maximize the value of our assets and screening techniques to discover novel drug candidates for use in additional disease indications.

Industry Overview—Cystic Fibrosis 
 CF is an orphan disease that affects an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 diagnosed patients worldwide, with the vast majority of individuals in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. CF is the most common fatal inherited disease in Caucasians. The incidence of CF varies across the globe. CF affects one out of 3,500 births in the United States, one out of 2,000 to 3,000 in Europe, and one out of 2,500 in Australia. 
 There is presently no cure for CF. It is a progressive disease caused by a deficiency in CFTR protein activity, resulting in the accumulation of thick mucus in vital organs, particularly the lungs, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. As a result, CF patients experience, among many other conditions, respiratory infections, chronic lung inflammation, poor absorption of nutrients and, in most cases, progressive respiratory failure. Although the life expectancy of CF patients has improved, the median age of death in the United States in 2016 was only 30 years, with a vast majority of such deaths resulting from respiratory failure. 
 CF patients require lifelong treatment with multiple daily medications, hours of self-care, frequent hospitalizations and lung transplants, which if available, are life-extending but not curative. 
 Kalydeco, Orkambi and Symdeko, products that contain CFTR modulators, are the only products currently approved to treat the underlying cause of the disease and are available to eligible CF patients in the United States, and certain other territories where they have received marketing and reimbursement approvals. The three products combined address genotypes present in approximately half of all CF patients, leaving a substantial portion of the global CF patient population without access to disease targeting therapies either due to label exclusion or lack of market access.
 In 2017, worldwide sales of Orkambi and Kalydeco were approximately $2.2 billion with analysts currently forecasting the cumulative sales of the two drugs to surpass $4 billion by 2020. 
 Patient advocacy and charitable not-for-profit organizations play an important role in raising disease awareness and advancing research and development of new therapeutic options.  In the United States, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, or CFF, a not-for-profit organization with $3.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments (as of December 31, 2016), contributes to clinical development by funding basic research and clinical trials, and granting awards for development of new drug candidates, thereby playing an important role in shaping the drug development landscape.

Cause and Pathophysiology 
 CF is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes CFTR protein, which plays a critical role in regulating the viscosity of the mucus layer that lines human organs. CFTR protein forms an ion channel that regulates the flow of ions in and out of the cells of vital organs such as the lungs, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. We refer to this as ion flow. When CFTR protein expels the ions, osmosis draws water out of the cell and hydrates the cell surface. Through regulation of the location of the ions across the cell membrane, the amount of salts in the fluid both inside and outside the cell remains balanced. 
 In CF patients, the CFTR gene is defective, and as a result, CF patients lack the functional CFTR protein ion channel necessary to regulate ion flow. Altered ion concentration gradient between the inside and the outside of the cell reduces the amount of water molecules outside the cell, causing the accumulation of thick mucus on the epithelial surface as shown in Figure 1. 
 Figure 1: Ion Flow in Normal CFTR Protein Compared to Mutant CFTR Protein 
 
The deficiency in CFTR protein activity in CF patients is particularly problematic in the lungs, where the build-up of thick mucus obstructs air flow and impairs proper immune response, which leads to chronic infection and persistent inflammation. In the pancreas and the gastrointestinal tract, the build-up of mucus prevents the release of digestive enzymes that help the body break down food and impairs the absorption of nutrients, resulting in poor growth and development. 
 Classes of CFTR Gene Mutations 
 CF is an autosomal, recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. A person must have a mutation in both copies of the CFTR gene to be afflicted. If both mutations are the same, the person has a homozygous mutation. If the mutations on both copies of the genes are different from one another, the person has a heterozygous mutation. If someone has a mutation in only one copy of the CFTR gene and the other copy is normal, he or she is a carrier but will not suffer from CF. 
 The vast majority of CF patients whose gene mutations have been identified have gene mutations that can be classified into five classes according to the biological process they affect: “Stop Codon,” “Processing,” “Gating,” “Conductance,” and “Synthesis.”

Table 1: Overview of CFTR Gene Mutation Classes 
 
 
Class | I Stop Codon Mutation | II Processing Mutation | III GatingMutation | IV Conductance Mutation | V Synthesis Mutation 
Defect | Protein translation prematurely stopped | Misfolded protein fails to reach surface | Regulationof ion flowis abnormal | Faulty channel conductance slows ion flow | Less CFTR protein is made

Prevalence in the United States and Canada* | 12% | 87% | 5% | 5% | 5% 
CFTR Modulators with POC** | Read Through Compound | Corrector and Potentiator | Potentiator | Potentiator | Potentiator 
Our Approach | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ 


* | The sum of the percentages in all classes exceeds 100% because individual CF patients might carry more than one mutation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


** | “POC”, or proof of concept, means demonstrated statistically significant clinical benefit in a controlled clinical trial.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Although F508del is the most common CFTR gene mutation, the frequency of its occurrence in CF patients can vary from region to region. For example, Table 2 summarizes the prevalence of F508del in CF patients in the regions where CF is most common. 
 Table 2: Summary of Largest CF Patient Populations by Region 
 
 
 | Number of Patients in National CF Registries | | % of Patients Homozygous for F508del | | % of Patients Heterozygous for F508del
----------------------+----------------------------------------------+--------+--------------------------------------+----+---------------------------------------
United States | | 28,000 | | 47 | % | 39 | %
Canada | | 4,100 | | 49 | % | 38 | %
Europe (32 countries) | | 40,000 | | 44 | % | 38 | %
Australia | | 3,000 | | 52 | % | 33 | %

 
Epidemiological forecasts predict that the total number of CF patients will grow significantly in the near term due to improvements in the standard of care, which has improved life expectancy. It is anticipated that the European CF population will grow by approximately 40% by 2025, reaching over 57,000 patients. The improvements in life expectancy in the United States and Canada suggest similar trends in CF population growth will likely occur in those territories.

Current Standard of Care 
 There presently is no cure for CF. Kalydeco, Orkambi and Symdeko are the only products currently approved to treat the underlying cause of CF. Kalydeco is a potentiator believed to increase CFTR protein activity by keeping the ion channel of the CFTR protein open for longer periods of time. However, Kalydeco is presently approved only for the treatment of CF patients with Gating mutations and R117H Conductance mutations, which impact less than 10% of the CF patient population in the United States and Canada. Although other potentiators may be developed, it is expected that potentiators, when used alone as a monotherapy, would likely address only Gating, Conductance and some Synthesis mutations, impacting only approximately 15% of all CF patients in those regions. Orkambi and Symdeko include correctors believed to improve protein folding and trafficking to enable abnormally folded protein to achieve some level of activity without repairing the actual protein, which works together with the same potentiator in Kalydeco, to enhance overall CFTR protein activity. However, both products are only approved for the treatment of CF patients who are homozygous for F508del, a genotype that represents approximately 45% of the CF patient population in the United States and Europe, although Symdeko is also approved for 22 specific additional mutations. 
 The current standard of care for all other CF patients remains the management of the disease symptoms. The thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract leads to airway obstruction and difficulty absorbing nutrients, resulting in poor growth and development. CF patients take numerous prescribed and over-the-counter medications to alleviate symptoms and reduce complications. Primary treatment options include inhaled therapies, which thin the mucus in the lungs, as well as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, which improves absorption of nutrients. In addition, because thick mucus in the lungs impairs CF patients’ immune response, they also often develop chronic bacterial lung infections that require treatment with inhaled antibiotics. 
 Pipeline Approaches to Improving Standard of Care
 The current CF drug development pipeline includes several therapeutic approaches aimed at either restoration of CFTR activity or improved symptoms management. One of the most promising approaches includes combinations of complementary CFTR modulators which tackle specific steps in the lifecycle of the mutated protein. The approvals of Orkambi and Symdeko validate the rationale for the combination of CFTR modulators, a corrector and a potentiator.  Two companies are exploring the therapeutic potential of triple combinations that involve co-administration of one potentiator and two correctors with most advanced studies currently in Phase 3. We believe that disease modifying therapies in CF will shift towards a triple combination approach which will become the new standard of care.  
 In addition to drug candidates targeting CFTR protein several other companies are pursuing different cellular targets that might have a beneficial effect on CF related symptoms. Recently, several companies and academic groups have begun to explore the application of early gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, to CF; if successful, these techniques could potentially address the underlying gene mutation defect. However, these technologies are in their infancy and are expected to take many years to develop and evaluate.
 Correlation of CFTR Protein Activity to Clinical Benefit 
 FEV1: Clinical Measurement of Lung Function 
 Because CF causes significant loss of lung function, the severity of CF progression is often measured by FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second), which is expressed as a percentage of the maximum volume of air that a healthy individual of the same height, sex and race could forcefully exhale from the lungs in one second. FEV1 is considered to be the industry-standard efficacy endpoint in clinical trials of CF product candidates. Rate of decline in FEV1 has been demonstrated to correlate with life expectancy and to be the strongest clinical predictor of mortality. 
 9


The decline in lung function is progressive and occurs throughout the life of a CF patient and in the vast majority of cases, leads to respiratory failure and death. The severity of lung disease is categorized as mild (FEV1 >70%), moderate (40%< FEV1<69%) or severe (FEV1<40%). The ultimate goal of CF therapy is to halt and reverse the decline of lung function in the hope of extending the life expectancy of patients, eliminating the need for lung transplants, and reclassifying the disease from a lethal to a chronic condition. 
 Sweat Chloride: Measurement of CFTR Activity
 Cystic fibrosis is a ‘whole body' disease with many clinical manifestations. Reduced CFTR function causes a defect in the sweat ducts of CF patients which leads their sweat to contain higher concentration of chloride. The sweat test, which measures the amount of chloride in the sweat, is considered the gold standard for diagnosing CF.
 It is believed that sweat chloride can predict clinical outcomes at the population level, supporting its role as a key outcome measure for clinical trials.
 Analysis of published clinical data with Kalydeco, a CFTR potentiator, found that short-term changes in the sweat chloride concentration in CF patients show a high likelihood for longer-term improvement in pulmonary function and weight gain.  
 Ussing Chamber Assay: In vitro Measurement of CFTR Protein Activity 
 CFTR modulators are typically evaluated by measuring CFTR protein activity in vitro using the Ussing Chamber Assay. In this assay, HBE cells derived from the lungs of CF patients are cultured in a manner to resemble the lung epithelium and then placed in the Ussing Chamber between two compartments filled with media, one containing ions that can only flow to the other compartment through the epithelium. The CFTR protein activity is measured by recording the electrical current generated by ions flowing across the cultured epithelium. CFTR protein activity is expressed as a percentage of the measured current relative to the current generated by ion flow in HBE cells with normal CFTR protein activity. 
 10


Strong Correlation between CFTR Protein Activity and Lung Function 
 Our analyses of published data on Vertex’s CFTR modulators (the potentiator ivacaftor and correctors lumacaftor and tezacaftor) show a strong correlation between the in vitro CFTR protein activity as measured by the Ussing Chamber Assay and lung function improvement measured by FEV1 improvement in clinical trials of these CF product candidates. Importantly, as shown in Figure 2, in vitro CFTR protein activity of these modulators at 50% of normal correlates with an absolute improvement of approximately 10% in FEV1 as seen in clinical trials. 
 Figure 2: CFTR Protein Activity is Highly Correlated with Observed Clinical Efficacy 
 
Strong Correlation between CFTR Protein Activity and Sweat Chloride
 The analysis of published data on CFTR modulators (the potentiators ivacaftor and GLPG1837; and the correctors lumacaftor and tezacaftor) suggest a strong correlation between the in vitro CFTR protein activity as measured by the Ussing Chamber Assay and reductions in sweat chloride concentration of treated CF patients. We believe the analysis supports the predictive value of in vitro CFTR protein activity with sweat chloride reductions seen in clinical trials observed with approved CFTR modulators.

Our Solution 
 We are developing and, if approved, intend to commercialize proprietary combination therapies for CF patients carrying at least one F508del allele, which may consist of a double and/or a triple combination.  Our current pipeline includes a double comprised of PTI-801, a corrector, and PTI-808, a potentiator, and a triple combination of PTI-428, an amplifier, together with PTI-801 and PTI-808. The three classes of CFTR modulators have pharmacological characteristics and a mechanism of action that is synergistic and act in different cellular compartments as shown in Figure 3. Amplifiers, a novel class of CFTR modulators, have been shown in in vitro studies to selectively increase the amount of the newly synthesized and unfolded form of CFTR protein in the cell, thereby providing additional substrate for other CFTR modulators, such as correctors and potentiators, to act upon, leading to improved overall CFTR protein activity. The combined effect of amplifiers and marketed or investigational correctors and potentiators further increases the CFTR protein activity, which, as described above, is predicted to correlate with improved clinical outcomes in CF. 
Figure 3: CFTR Modulators 
 
Our approach to building a comprehensive franchise of CFTR modulators has leveraged amplifiers as a screening tool for discovering novel CFTR modulators such as potentiators, correctors and read through agents. We plan to continue drug discovery and development programs and broaden our CF pipeline with additional CFTR modulators that have the potential for combined use and full restoration of CFTR activity in various genotypes.Our Product Candidates 
 By combining our understanding of protein homeostasis with our discovery and development expertise, we have built a robust pipeline of programs targeting the key mechanisms underlying CF and other rare diseases. 
 CFTR modulators are compounds that affect the folding, trafficking and clearance of CFTR protein and can be classified according to ways in which they affect CFTR protein. Despite the approval of Kalydeco, a potentiator, and Orkambi and Symdeko, each a combination of a potentiator and corrector, we believe there is still significant potential for improvement in clinical outcomes beyond existing treatments and therapies presently in clinical development for the treatment of CF. We have identified a novel class of CFTR modulators, amplifiers, that we believe are synergistic with Orkambi and Symdeko and could potentially enhance their ability to improve CFTR function. We have subsequently identified proprietary correctors and potentiators that are complementary to our amplifiers and designed to work synergistically to restore CFTR function to approximately normal levels. 
 12


Our product candidate PTI-428, an orally bioavailable amplifier, is a novel, first-in-class drug candidate that, when used in combination with existing treatments and therapies presently in clinical development, has shown a consistent positive effect on CFTR protein activity in vitro. We have identified novel correctors and potentiators that, when combined with an amplifier, have restored in vitro CFTR protein activity to approximately 100% of normal in cells homozygous for F508del.  PTI-428 has completed Phase 1 and 2 studies in the United States in healthy volunteers and CF subjects.
 PTI-801, our lead corrector agent, and PTI-808, our lead potentiator agent, are drug development candidates in clinical development as a double combination and, when combined with PTI-428, are active components of our triple combination. We intend to initiate a triple combination study during 2018. We submitted an IND for PTI-801, a corrector molecule, to the FDA in the first quarter of 2017, which is now active, and are in clinical development to study PTI-801 as an add-on to CF patients on background Orkambi. We also submitted an IND for PTI-808, during the second quarter of 2017, which is now active. We have completed a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers of both PTI-808 and a co-administration of our triple combination agents. We believe that the treatment paradigm in CF for the majority of patients could be based on combination therapies of CFTR modulators as a double combination of our proprietary corrector PTI-801 and potentiator PTI-808 and/or as a triple combination anchored by PTI-428.  We also believe that our PTI-801 corrector and PTI-428 amplifier candidates have the potential to be add-on therapies to existing and possible future standard of care CFTR modulator therapies Orkambi and Symdeko. 
 Our studies show that amplifiers selectively increase the amount of the newly synthesized, unfolded form of CFTR protein in the cell, thus increasing the amount of CFTR protein available for trafficking. When combined with ivacaftor and either lumacaftor or tezacaftor, PTI-428 nearly doubles the in vitro CFTR protein activity in cells homozygous for F508del in our Ussing Chamber Assays compared to a combination of only ivacaftor and lumacaftor. 
 Our CF product pipeline is described in more detail in Figure 4. 
 Figure 4: Our CF Product Pipeline 
 
We have identified novel correctors and potentiators that, when combined with an amplifier, have restored in vitro CFTR protein activity to approximately 100% of normal in cells homozygous for F508del. PTI-801 and PTI-808 are drug development candidates which, when combined with PTI-428, are active components of our triple combination.
 13


We believe that combinations of our own CFTR modulators in double or triple combination, and PTI-428 and PTI-801 as single agents as add-ons to current and future standard of care CFTR modulator therapies, have the potential to address a significant portion of underserved patients. We have shown that PTI-428, when used in combination with ivacaftor and either lumacaftor or tezacaftor, nearly doubles in vitro CFTR protein activity in the Ussing chamber assay compared to treatment without PTI-428. 
 We have also demonstrated that the combination of one of our proprietary amplifiers, together with a proprietary corrector and a proprietary potentiator, can achieve mechanistic synergy and restore in vitro CFTR protein activity to approximately 100% of normal in patient-derived HBE cells homozygous for F508del. We believe that with these results, our combination therapies have the potential to deliver a more clinically meaningful benefit to a broader set of mutation classes than those addressed by presently approved therapies and those under development.
 Combination Therapies 
 Combination therapy of compounds that act synergistically on CFTR protein biosynthesis, folding, trafficking and conductance has been validated in preclinical models and clinical studies in CF patients. With the approval of CFTR modulators, the CF treatment paradigm is shifting from palliative care to the advancement of disease-modifying modulators that target the underlying cause of the disease which is CFTR protein malfunction. We are taking advantage of the potential ability of PTI-428 to enhance clinical efficacy of potentiators and correctors to develop novel proprietary combinations. 
 Using our expertise to screen compounds that are complementary with PTI-428, we are designing and developing correctors and potentiators that are optimized to work more synergistically with our proprietary CFTR modulators than third-party CFTR modulators. We are in clinical development with PTI-801, a corrector molecule, and PTI-808, a potentiator molecule, which, when combined with PTI-428, are active components of our triple combination product and we aim to initiate a triple combination study in 2018. We are currently in clinical development with CF patients taking a double combination of PTI-801 and PTI-808.  In addition to having desirable drug-like properties, the molecules have differentiated features. PTI-801 acts in a complimentary and synergistic way with other correctors, such as lumacaftor, suggesting a different mechanism of action. Furthermore, we have seen in vitro that it prevents ivacaftor induced destabilization of F508del CFTR upon chronic exposure. 
 We have demonstrated that our triple combination of PTI-428 together with PTI-801, our novel corrector, and PTI-808, our novel potentiator, can achieve mechanistic synergy leading to a full restoration of in vitro CFTR protein activity in patient-derived HBE cells homozygous for F508del. Additionally, the combination of PTI-801 and PTI-808 has demonstrated superior in vitro efficacy compared to the combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. We anticipate that these findings, described in Figure 5 below, could potentially translate into a more clinically meaningful benefit to a broader set of mutation classes than those addressed by therapies that are presently approved or known to be under development.

Mechanism of Action of PTI-428
 While the specific molecular target for PTI-428 remains unknown, our in vitro studies show that PTI-428 has a unique effect on in vitro CFTR protein activity. PTI-428 has been observed to selectively increase the amount of the newly synthesized and unfolded form of CFTR protein in the patient-derived HBE cells. 
 As shown in Figure 6, during the translation process of mRNA into protein, the signal recognition particle, or SRP, binds to a special portion of the emerging chain of amino acids, called the signal sequence, and shuttles the entire mRNA-ribosome complex to the ER surface, where the emerging chain of amino acids can be properly folded into the protein. Increased SRP recognition of the signal sequence facilitates protein synthesis and, by blocking RNA degradation processes, stabilizes mRNA. Because our in vitro studies show that PTI-428 increases both the CFTR mRNA and the amount of the newly synthesized and unfolded form of the CFTR protein, we believe that PTI-428 improves the translation of CFTR protein at the ER membrane, resulting in more of the newly synthesized and unfolded form of CFTR protein being made. By providing more CFTR protein, PTI-428 can significantly increase the effect of correctors and potentiators on in vitro CFTR protein activity in HBE cells homozygous and heterozygous for F508del. 
 15


Figure 6: PTI-428 Improves the Efficiency of Translation and as a Result Decreases mRNA Decay
 
Although the mechanism of action is not fully characterized, we have confirmed that PTI-428 does not belong to a known class of potentiators or correctors. Potentiators, such as ivacaftor, are believed to increase CFTR protein activity by keeping the ion channel of the CFTR protein open for longer periods of time. The distinguishing feature of potentiators is the so-called “acute effect” observed in vitro as measured by increased CFTR protein activity immediately upon the addition of the molecule to the cells. However, our in vitro studies show that acute addition of PTI-428 does not immediately affect CFTR protein activity. 
 Likewise, correctors, such as lumacaftor and tezacaftor, alter the ratio of unfolded to fully folded form of CFTR protein by acting on the protein folding process to increase the amount of the mature form. Our in vitro studies show that PTI-428 does not affect the ratio of the two protein forms, but rather leads to increases in the total amount of both forms of CFTR protein in a dose-dependent fashion. 
 Accordingly, we believe that PTI-428 represents a new class of CFTR modulator, which we call amplifiers, distinct from correctors and potentiators that target CFTR biosynthesis at the upstream translational level by enhancing successful signal-sequence targeting to the ER membrane. Furthermore, the effect on CFTR mRNA is specific and genotype agnostic. PTI-428 does not appear to increase mRNA levels in vitro for the so-called housekeeping genes that are needed for the normal functioning of the cell. In a surface and total protein expression assay, which measures changes in the abundance of proteins both on the plasma membrane and within the cell, PTI-428 was shown to increase the levels of CFTR, but not PgP, a closely related membrane protein. Additionally, we have confirmed that cells exposed to PTI-428 do not activate stress response pathways that are typically triggered by pathological accumulations of unfolded protein, further suggesting the specificity of this pharmacological class and lack of cellular stress induction. 
 PTI-428 – In Vitro Studies 
 An Ussing Chamber Assay study with HBE cells homozygous for F508del was conducted to assess the effects of PTI-428 in combination with ivacaftor and lumacaftor on in vitro CFTR protein activity. HBE cells were incubated with lumacaftor with or without PTI-428 for 24 hours before adding ivacaftor during the measurement of ion flow in the Ussing Chamber Assay. As shown in Figure 7, addition of PTI-428 to a combination of ivacaftor and lumacaftor resulted in an approximately 1.8-fold increase in in vitro CFTR protein activity, as measured by ion flow, compared to the potentiator and corrector combination alone. We then replicated the study with ivacaftor and another corrector, tezacaftor, with similar results as those indicated in Figure 7. 
 16


Figure 7: Ion Flow in Patient-Derived HBE Cells with F508del Mutations
 
Furthermore, similar experiments using HBE cells heterozygous for F508del mutation (G542X/F508del) showed that the addition of PTI-428 to ivacaftor and lumacaftor led to a 1.9-fold increase in ion flow compared to ivacaftor and lumacaftor alone. Similarly, the addition of PTI-428 to ivacaftor in R117H/F508del HBE cells led to a greater than 1.9-fold increase in ion flow compared to ivacaftor alone. In addition, our experiments show that PTI-428 added to ivacaftor demonstrates a 1.6-fold increase in in vitro CFTR protein activity to that observed with ivacaftor in G551D/F508del HBE cells. 
 Experiments using HBE cells homozygous for a Class I G542X showed that the addition of PTI-428 led to a 2.0-fold increase in ion flow compared to negative control and an additive effect with NB124, a molecule used as a research tool to study nonsense mutations. Similarly, the addition of PTI-428 to HBE cells carrying Class V and II mutations 3849+10kbC->T/N1303K led to a greater than 1.3-fold increase in ion flow compared to negative control and an additive effect with ivacaftor. 
 Additionally, in experiments using patient-derived HBE cells homozygous for F508del, exposure to PTI-428 led to an increase in CFTR mRNA and higher CFTR protein activity, with both changes in the 1.5 to 2.0-fold range, suggesting a positive correlation and predictive value of CFTR mRNA measurement for the drug’s efficacy. 
 We are not aware of other compounds presently in development for the treatment of CF that increase the amount of CFTR mRNA or CFTR protein. 
 Clinical Development Programs 
 In December 2015, the investigational new drug application, or IND, that we submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate our PTI-428 product candidate became active. We initiated our first Phase 1 clinical trial in CF patients and healthy volunteers in the first half of 2016. The Phase 1 trial in CF patients included single ascending dose, or SAD, and multiple ascending dose, or MAD, cohorts. The Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers included SAD and MAD cohorts to assess the safety, pharmacokinetic and exploratory biomarker results. We reported preliminary safety, pharmacokinetic and exploratory biomarker data from SAD and MAD cohorts in the PTI-428 Phase 1 clinical trial in CF subjects receiving PTI-428 or placebo for 7 days in addition to Orkambi® as their background, standard of care therapy, as well as a cohort of CF subjects receiving PTI-428 or placebo for 7 days who were not taking CFTR modulator based therapies. 
 17


We have completed a 28-day Phase 2 clinical trial for PTI-428 in CF patients randomized to receive either PTI-428 or placebo for 28 days in addition to Orkambi® as their background, standard of care therapy to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 50 mg of once-a-day PTI-428. In December of 2017, we announced the results of the study which showed that the addition of PTI-428 to Orkambi® demonstrated mean absolute improvements in ppFEV1 of 5.2 percentage points from baseline compared to placebo (p≤0.05), with mean relative improvements of 9.2 percent (p≤0.05). This treatment effect was achieved by day 14 and sustained through 28 days of dosing.
 In CF subjects on Orkambi® therapy, it has been shown in two registrational Phase 3 studies that the magnitude of response to Orkambi varied according to patient lung function at screening suggesting that the overall efficacy captured in these studies was mainly driven by the subgroup with baseline ppFEV1 below 70% (+3.3 percentage points) while the changes in the group with FEV1 ≥70% were not statistically significant. A similar analysis was performed in our 28-day study with PTI-428 and it showed an average +6.6 percentage points (p<0.05) increase in absolute ppFEV1 compared to placebo for patients who had lower baseline ppFEV1 value (<70%). The results of the subgroup analysis are consistent with phase 3 data with Orkambi®, suggesting that PTI-428 potentially amplifies the Orkambi® effect in the responder population.
 Additional endpoints in the study included measurement of changes in sweat chloride (secondary endpoint) and CFTR expression in nasal epithelia (exploratory endpoint). In this study, a positive increase in CFTR protein from baseline was observed in PTI-428 treated subjects and the magnitude of change was consistent with the changes in CFTR protein levels observed in an in vitro human bronchial cell (HBE) cell model.  In contrast, changes in sweat chloride did not correlate with changes in lung function.
 In the 28-day study, PTI-428 was generally well tolerated and lacked clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions with ivacaftor and lumacaftor.   Fourteen of 20 subjects receiving PTI-428 and two of four subjects receiving placebo experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event. There were no serious adverse events and there were 2 adverse events that led to study discontinuation. Both cases were thrombocytopenia of mild grade and comparable magnitude and value. One occurred while a subject was on Orkambi® only and one in a subject receiving PTI-428 with both subjects resolving spontaneously.
 In March 2018, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for PTI-428 for the treatment of CF in homozygous patients for the F508del mutation who are receiving Orkambi® as background therapy.  The designation was based on the FDA’s review of available clinical evidence, including the observed increase in FEV1 and CFTR protein levels in the 28-day study.  Breakthrough Therapy designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). Also in March 2018, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation for PTI-428. The FDA grants orphan designation to promote the development of product candidates for rare conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 U.S. patients annually. This designation provides for a seven-year marketing exclusivity period against competition, as well as certain incentives, including federal grants, tax credits and a waiver of certain administrative filing fees.
 In the second half of 2018, we plan to initiate a clinical study with PTI-428 in CF subjects on background Symdeko therapy with initial data expected early next year.  
 Our IND for the Phase 1 study of PTI-801, a corrector molecule, was submitted to the FDA in the first quarter of 2017 and is now active. In March 2017, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the investigation of PTI-801 for the treatment of CF. We completed dosing of subjects in the key SAD and MAD cohorts of the healthy volunteer portion of this study, to assess the safety and PK of PTI-801, and reported initial data on this portion of the study in 2017. 
 We have initiated a 14-day once-a-day dosing study with PTI-801 in CF subjects on background Orkambi therapy. In December of 2017, we reported initial data from a preliminary ad hoc analysis of the first five subjects (four PTI-801 treated and one placebo) of the first dose level tested.  All four subjects who received once-a-day 100 mg of PTI-801 completed two weeks of dosing. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile observed from these four subjects was consistent with the PK profile observed for healthy volunteers. These initial data also showed no clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions with either lumacaftor or ivacaftor.  There were no serious adverse safety events reported that were considered as possibly drug related.  Mean absolute improvements in ppFEV1 of approximately 4 percentage points from baseline, with mean relative improvements of approximately 7 percent, were observed in the four PTI-801 subjects who completed two weeks of dosing. This study, designed to investigate the effect of PTI-801 in escalating doses in multiple cohorts, is continuing. 
 18


Our IND for the Phase 1 study of PTI-808, a potentiator molecule, was submitted to the FDA in the second quarter of 2017 and is now active. PTI-808 has completed investigation in 48 healthy volunteers with up to 300 mg in single and multiple dose cohorts. PTI-808 was found to be generally well tolerated.  One subject experienced a serious adverse event from a pre-existing condition of transverse myelitis. This serious adverse event was considered unlikely to be related to the study drug. No adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment were reported.  All other adverse events that have been reported to date were of mild or moderate severity. Preliminary PK assessment of PTI-808 suggests that it could potentially be suitable for once daily dosing. 
 Co-administration of PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 has been completed in 20 healthy volunteer subjects.  Safety and PK profiles achieved with seven days of once-a-day oral dosing of PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 indicated these compounds were generally well-tolerated and could potentially be amenable for once a day dosing. No SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment were reported.  The PK data demonstrated a lack of clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions.  
 Combination study protocols for trials in CF patients have been reviewed by key patient advocacy and regulatory authorities in US and Europe. In January of 2018, we announced that our triple combination clinical study protocol received endorsement and a high strategic fit score from the Therapeutics Development Network (TDN) and the Clinical Trial Network (CTN). Our double combination protocol has also received the endorsement of the TDN. The TDN and CTN are the drug development arms of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and the European CF Society (ECFS), respectively.
 
Our ongoing clinical trials are summarized as follows:
 Add-on therapy:
 PTI-801: We are conducting a 14-day once-a-day, placebo controlled, double blind, dosing study with PTI-801 in CF subjects on background Orkambi therapy. This Phase 1 study is designed to investigate the effect of PTI-801 in escalating doses in multiple cohorts, with primary objectives of safety and tolerability and secondary objectives of PK and FEV1.
 PTI-428: We are planning a clinical study with PTI-428 in CF subjects on background Symdeko therapy.
 PTI-428: We are studying PTI-428 in a 14-day once-a-day, placebo controlled, double blind, dose-range study in patients on background Kalydeco.
 Combination studies: 
 We are conducting Phase 1 combination studies with our proprietary drug candidates PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808, in double and triple combination formats with an expected enrollment of up to 46 CF patients.  
  
• | Double combination: we have commenced dosing CF subjects homozygous for the F508del mutation in a 14-day double combination study of PTI-801 and PTI-808, expected to consist of two cohorts with escalating doses of both agents in the second cohort. This study is placebo-controlled. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Triple combination: we aim to initiate dosing of CF subjects homozygous for the F508del mutation in a 21-day study of PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808, expected to consist of two cohorts with escalating doses of PTI-808 in the second cohort and fixed doses of PTI-801 and PTI-808. This study is placebo-controlled and will consist of a 7-day run-in where patients will be dosed solely with PTI-808, followed by a period of 14 days where patients will be taking all three investigational drugs. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have completed 28-day GLP preclinical combination safety studies to support our combination trials.
 19


In 2018, we aim to (1) produce additional data from our 14-day study of PTI-801 in CF patients on background Orkambi in the first half, (2) continue dosing CF patients in a double combination trial consisting of PTI-801 and PTI-808, and produce initial data by mid-year, (3) initiate a triple combination of our proprietary agents PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808 in CF patients in the first half, and produce preliminary data in the second half and (4) initiate a clinical study with PTI-428 in patients on background Symdeko in the second half with initial data in early 2019.
 Commercialization 
 We have exclusive worldwide commercial rights to PTI-428, PTI-801 and PTI-808, as well as our proprietary combinations. We plan to pursue regulatory approval for add-on therapies based on PTI-428 and/or PTI-801 in regions where ivacaftor and lumacaftor (and ivacaftor and tezacaftor, as applicable) are commercially available. Given the well-characterized and clearly identified patient populations with CF in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia, we plan to independently commercialize PTI-428 and/or PTI-801 in those regions. Our commercialization strategy will target key prescribing physicians and advocacy groups, as well as provide patients with support programs, ensure product access and secure reimbursement.  
 Our pricing and reimbursement strategy for therapies will be based on the efficacy and safety profile that will be collected during registrational studies. Pharmacoeconomic models that could support our potential pricing considerations for a CFTR modulator have been widely used in territories where the drug is approved and provide us with validated strategies to be used in future pricing and reimbursement negotiations. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 We do not own or operate, and presently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We presently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any products that we may commercialize. We have outsourced the manufacturing of current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP-grade, product for preclinical studies and clinical trials. Our contract manufacturers have had and we believe that they will have the capacity to produce adequate quantities of PTI-428, PTI-801, and PTI-808 for both our preclinical studies and our clinical trials. We do not presently have arrangements in place for redundant supply for bulk drug substance. For all of our product candidates, we intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services prior to submission of an NDA to the FDA. 
 We have entered into manufacturing and supply agreements with three vendors and these activities are ongoing. As of the date of this report, we believe we have access to sufficient amounts of cGMP-certified material for use in our clinical trials. 
 All of our compounds are organic compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. They can be manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from inexpensive and readily available starting materials that can be supplied by a number of commercial vendors. The chemistry is amenable to scale-up and does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. 
 Regulatory Strategy
 We plan to conduct clinical studies for our CF programs in territories with the largest populations of CF patients such as North America, Europe and Australia. We therefore rely on local regulatory and ethics authorities for the approval of our IND or equivalent submissions. All three compounds have active INDs under the FDA in the United States and approvals by regulatory bodies in ex-U.S. territories where the respective study or studies are ongoing and active.
 20


For CF, in addition to regulatory agencies, patient advocacy groups can play a key role in helping access study subjects. In the United States, the TDN has developed a network consisting of 89 CF centers to ensure consistency and high quality of clinical study execution. We believe TDN endorsement is an important factor for CF centers in deciding whether to participate in a CF trial, and which trials to prioritize.  In Europe, the CTN, the development arm of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society, acts in a somewhat analogous manner, as a patient advocacy group that reviews and ranks protocols for CF trials. PTI-428 has received the priority score “high medium” by the CTN.  Our triple combination clinical study protocol has received endorsement and a high strategic fit score from the Therapeutics Development Network (TDN) and the Clinical Trial Network (CTN). Our double combination protocol has also received the endorsement of the TDN. The TDN and CTN are the drug development arms of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and the European CF Society (ECFS), respectively.  The protocol for PTI-801 has also been endorsed by both organizations.
 
The CFF and ECFS are the most impactful CF patient advocacy organizations and shepherd the execution of clinical trials in the United States and Europe, respectively.  Both organizations have well established processes to evaluate submitted study protocols based on scientific merit, study design, feasibility and the overall clinical research priorities of the CF community.  Protocols are reviewed by a selected group of experienced CF physician investigators, research coordinators, biostatisticians, people with CF and other specialists.
 In the United States, upon the protocol endorsement, the TDN provides access to 89 accredited care centers with demonstrated expertise in clinical research, and supports study participant recruitment and execution of studies.  Since its founding in 1998, the TDN has conducted more than 130 clinical studies for CF, including studies of CFTR modulators. Similarly, in Europe, the CTN provides access for endorsed studies to 43 large and experienced CF centers located in 15 different countries, including the U.K. The TDN and the CTN have established a strong partnership for endorsed studies conducted in both the U.S. and Europe.  
 For all of our CF programs, we intend to maintain a proactive relationship with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics and the TDN. We will continue to access patient-derived HBE cells from the Foundation’s database to conduct ongoing preclinical studies. 
 There is a large number of CF programs in clinical development at this time, including numerous corrector and combination trials from Vertex and other companies with greater resources and experience than us which may increase competition for patients to enroll in our clinical trials.
 Our Partnered Program 
 The UPR Program 
 The unfolded protein response, or UPR, program is focused on developing therapies that modulate the cellular processes activated when proteins do not fold properly and is directed toward developing treatments for diseases caused by defects in protein folding, trafficking and clearance, which include neural and retinal degenerative disorders. The ER is an organelle in the cell that is important in biosynthesis and folding of proteins. Only properly folded and functional proteins are trafficked out from the ER. Misfolded, poorly functional proteins remain in the ER and are targeted for clearance. When misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, the folding, trafficking and clearance capacity of the cell is increased through the activation of the UPR, and protein synthesis is arrested through activation of the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase, or PERK, receptor. Nonclinical studies have shown that a selective pharmacologic activation of the UPR without activating the PERK pathway has improved the stress response and restored cellular function, suggesting that this process can be beneficial as a potential novel disease-modifying therapy for multiple diseases with high unmet medical needs. 
 In November 2014, we announced our collaboration with Astellas to research, develop and commercialize therapies targeting UPR. See “—Licenses—Astellas Agreement.” By specific activation of the UPR, we aim to better fold and export mutant proteins out of the ER and reduce the accumulation of misfolded aggregation-prone proteins. We are presently using our expertise to identify selective UPR activators. Preclinical evidence suggests that selectively activating the UPR could have therapeutic benefit in patients in a variety of diseases. As of today, the vast majority of drug discovery and development efforts are focused on the therapy of cancer with molecules inhibiting specific elements of the UPR. See “—Competition.”

Expertise Regarding the Proteostasis Network
 We were founded around our unique and comprehensive expertise regarding the proteostasis network, or PN, which comprises pathways and cellular processes that control protein biosynthesis, folding, trafficking and clearance within a cell. Many diseases appear to be caused by an imbalance in the proteostasis network, including loss-of-function diseases, such as CF, and gain-of-toxic-function diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. The decreased ability of the proteostasis network to cope with misfolded proteins from inherited gene mutations, aging, and metabolic or environmental stress appears to trigger or exacerbate proteostasis diseases. 
 The proteostasis network is comprised of a number of integrated pathways totaling more than 1,000 proteins. A natural way to address this complex, interrelated network of pathways and proteins is through phenotypic screening where a desirable change in the cellular phenotype is monitored. A phenotypic screen is often viewed as more physiologically relevant and less artificial than a target-based screen, since it relies on cells with a native cellular environment close to the disease state, unlike other widely used approaches such as target-based assays that are based on genetically modified cells or artificial systems. For example, in CF screens, the change in phenotype is a functional readout for an increased ability of mutant CFTR protein to transport ions across the membranes of HBE cells from CF patients. 
 We have developed and validated a phenotypic drug screening approach that is based on the use of highly predictive and functionally pertinent cellular assays. Our expertise regarding the PN is an integral part of our drug discovery and development approach used to discover compounds for other loss-of-function and gain-of-toxic-function diseases. We believe our PN expertise allows us to identify drug candidates with optimal pharmacological profiles to restore the proteostasis balance in the cell and thus address the cause of the disease. Our approach makes it also possible to identify active compounds that modulate a disease phenotype by acting on previously undescribed targets. 
 We have assembled a proprietary library of 150,000 highly curated compounds. These compounds have physicochemical properties optimized to have oral bioavailability, wide structural diversity and novelty. We have performed extensive filtering in order to remove potentially toxic and other unwanted structural characteristics. 
 We perform a transcriptional analysis of our hit compounds in order to group them into similar modes of action and filter away compounds that activate undesired pathways. The most promising hits are then further optimized using medicinal chemistry, which includes pharmacophore and quantum chemical modeling. 
 Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price, and reimbursement. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. Many of these potential competitors have significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products and have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of competitors. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for therapies and achieving widespread market acceptance more quickly than we will. Our competitors’ products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any product candidate we may commercialize and may render our therapies obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover development and commercialization expenses. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates.” 
 A number of companies are seeking to identify and develop drug candidates for the treatment of CF, including Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, AbbVie Inc., Galapagos NV, ProQR Therapeutics N.V., Flatley Discovery Lab, LLC, F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd., Novartis AG, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Laurent Pharmaceuticals Inc., Pfizer Inc., AstraZeneca, Translate Bio Inc., Sanofi Genzyme, Bayer AG, Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings, Inc., Eloxx Pharmaceuticals, Verona  Pharma plc, and several other companies. Of these, Vertex’s Kalydeco, Orkambi and Symdeko are the only drugs approved to treat an underlying cause of CF, rather than the symptoms.  
 22


A number of companies are active in drug discovery and development for the treatment of diseases caused by protein misfolding by pursuing various pathways that regulate the fate of a misfolded protein within a cell. Such companies could be competitive with the UPR program and include, but are not limited to, Forma Therapeutics, Inc., Mission Therapeutics Ltd, Treventis Corporation, Arvinas, Inc., Progenra, Inc. and Proteologics Ltd. 
 Intellectual Property
 Our owned patent applications relate to our amplifiers, correctors, and CFTR modulators and include patent applications directed to new compositions of matter and to methods of treating CF, including combination therapies with existing CFTR modulators and our own proprietary combinations.
 As of December 31, 2017, we own three Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications, and one pending U.S. provisional patent application family and we intend to seek patent protection in the United States and in selected jurisdictions worldwide for composition of matter, methods of use, and combination therapies relating to PTI-428. If we continue to pursue protection, and if any patents issue based on these applications, we expect such patents, if issued, to expire between 2035 and 2038. 
 As of December 31, 2017, we own one Patent Cooperation Treaty patent application and one pending U.S. provisional patent application and we intend to seek patent protection in the United States and in selected jurisdictions worldwide for composition of matter, methods of use, and combination therapies relating to new correctors, including PTI-801. If we continue to pursue protection, and if any patents issue based on this application family, we expect such patents to expire between 2036 and 2038.
 As of December 31, 2017, we own one Patent Cooperation Treaty patent application relating to new potentiators, including PTI-808. If we continue to pursue protection, and if any patents issue based on this application, we expect such patents to expire in 2037. 
 We also own two issued U.S. patents, eight pending U.S. patent applications, six Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications, all of which generally relate to other compounds and methods for our CF program; if we continue to pursue protection, and if any patents issue based on these applications, in the United States and in selected jurisdictions worldwide, we expect such patents, if issued, to expire between 2034 and 2037.
 We primarily rely on trade secrets and know-how to protect the proprietary nature of our research and discovery platform. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, know-how and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 Licenses 
 CFFT Agreement 
 In March 2012, we entered into a research, development and commercialization agreement with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc., or CFFT, pursuant to which we have collaborated to research, develop and commercialize products for the treatment of CF, non-classical CF, and other pulmonary diseases in the United States or in the European Union. Under this agreement, CFFT provided financial support and continues to provide consultation and advice and certain research materials and know-how for our research program. 
 23


We expect to make milestone payments based on PTI-428, if approved, and may need to make additional payments for our other product candidates in CF, if approved. We have agreed to make future sales-based milestone payments (which the agreement refers to as royalties) to CFFT of up to $34.2 million upon achieving specified commercialization milestones with respect to the first of any product developed utilizing any compound covered under the collaboration agreement. We have also agreed to pay to CFFT royalties of a mid single-digit percentage, up to an aggregate of $22.8 million, on any amounts received by us from the sale, license or transfer to a third party of rights in the technology developed as a result of this collaboration. Any such royalty payments shall be credited against the first three sales-based milestone payments owed by us through the second anniversary of the first commercial sale of a product developed as a result of this collaboration. In the event of a change of control of our company, CFFT will receive certain payments, depending on the timing of the change of control and the size of the transaction. 
 We have the exclusive right to develop, commercialize, market, sell and distribute products worldwide. All joint technology from of the research program is jointly owned by the parties, but we have a license from CFFT for all CFFT-owned inventions and patents and in the joint inventions and joint patents arising from the collaboration for all purposes. We control and cover the costs of the preparation, prosecution and maintenance and enforcement of all of our patents, CFFT-owned patents and joint patents, but CFFT is able to use compounds for non-commercial research purposes in the field of treatment of CF, non-classical CF, and other pulmonary diseases. 
 The agreement will expire when there are no longer any payment obligations, unless terminated earlier. Each party may terminate for an uncured material breach of any material covenants or obligations or if any representation or warranty is materially untrue as of the date made and uncured after 30 days from notice. CFFT may also terminate if a case or proceeding under the bankruptcy laws is filed against our company and not dismissed within 60 days, or if we file for insolvency, reorganization, receivership, dissolution or liquidation of our company. 
 If at any time prior to the first commercial sale, we cease to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or commercialize any product in the field of treatment of CF, non-classical CF, and other pulmonary diseases, for a continuous period of 180 consecutive days, and fail to present a reasonable plan to resume commercially reasonable efforts, we will grant to CFFT an irrevocable, exclusive worldwide interruption license under all of our interest in the research plan technology to exploit such product, and CFFT will assume all costs and expenses relating to the prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of all joint patents and patents covering such product. Any third-party license granted by us shall be subject to such interruption license. 
 Terminated Harvard Agreement 
 In December 2013, we amended and restated an existing license agreement signed on March 29, 2011 with the President and Fellows of Harvard College, or Harvard, in order to enter into a sublicense agreement with Biogen, or the Usp 14 agreement, which agreement was subsequently terminated by Biogen, to further develop and commercialize certain products under the Usp14 agreement and to retain the services of consultants Drs. Daniel Finley and Randall King for such purpose. 
 In October of 2017, we terminated the license agreement with Harvard University.  Following the termination, all licenses granted by either party to the other under the agreement terminated. The footnotes to our financial statements describe our surviving milestone and royalty obligations. 
 Terminated Biogen Agreement 
 In December 2013, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the Usp14 agreement, with Biogen, where we agreed to collaborate to research, develop and commercialize licensed products to attack toxic proteins implicated in the development of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. On December 5, 2016, we received notice from Biogen of termination of the Usp14 agreement effective as of December 6, 2016.  Following the termination, all licenses granted by either party to the other under the Usp14 agreement terminated. Additionally, the exclusivity provisions in the Usp14 agreement terminated and now each party is free to research, develop and commercialize products that modulate the target (Usp14) either by themselves or with third parties, subject to the intellectual property rights of the other party.
 24


In connection with the collaboration, we received from Biogen an initial upfront payment and an equity investment, as well as research and development expense reimbursements. Additionally, we also received a milestone payment of $2.0 million for achieving an initial preclinical milestone on July 2014. Following the termination, no future research and development expense reimbursements, milestones or royalties are payable under the Usp14 agreement. 
 Astellas Agreement 
 In November 2014, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Astellas Pharma Inc., or Astellas, to develop cell assays for high throughput screening, and to identify, develop and commercialize drug candidates relating to the unfolded protein response pathway. 
 Astellas will develop and have full control over, at its sole cost and expense, the commercialization of each licensed product. If we elect to co-develop a product candidate, we will be responsible for a percentage of the co-development costs for such development compound. We will also have the opportunity to co-promote licensed products with Astellas in the United States on a fee-for-service basis. 
 In connection with the collaboration, we received an initial upfront investment from Astellas. We are entitled to certain research, development and sales milestone payments that could result in total payments of up to approximately $400 million, as well as royalties ranging in the mid single-digit to low double-digit percentages, subject to any third-party license fees we pay or need to pay. In addition, Astellas had the right to specify two additional projects to be conducted under the same terms, which, if it fully exercised this right, would bring the total potential payments under the collaboration to $1.2 billion. This right to specify two additional projects was not fully exercised by Astellas and lapsed as of November 4, 2016. 
 We will jointly own any collaboration technology and all intellectual property rights therein and will be jointly responsible for the prosecution and maintenance (including costs) of all collaboration patent rights, provided that our company will have final decision making authority until the time a development candidate is designated. 
 The collaboration and license agreement will remain in effect until the end of the royalty term, which will vary on a country-by-country basis, ending on the later of (a) 11 years following the first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country, (b) the expiration of the last valid claim covering such licensed product in such country, or (c) the expiration of the data protection period for such licensed product, unless terminated earlier. Upon expiration, but not termination, the development and commercialization license will become fully-paid up and perpetual. Astellas may terminate the agreement at any time following completion of the research term on a licensed product-by-licensed product and a country-by-country basis, or terminate the agreement in its entirety, by providing written notice to us. Astellas may also terminate on a project-by-project basis upon 20 days’ to six months’ notice, depending on the phase of research in progress. Either party may terminate for a material breach by the other party which is uncured within 60 days or for bankruptcy of the other party. If Astellas challenges a patent right or collaboration patent right of ours, we may terminate the agreement upon written notice to Astellas. 
 Upon a termination of the agreement other than by Astellas for cause, Astellas will grant to us a reverted product license, assign regulatory and clinical data and agreements with third parties that relate exclusively to reverted products and provide commercially reasonable assistance to permit us to develop or commercialize such reverted products in their reverted territory. 
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing. 
 25


A number of different regulatory agencies may be involved, depending on the product at issue, and the type and stage of activity. These include the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, or HHS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other federal agencies, state boards of pharmacy, state departments of health and more. 
 U.S. Government Regulation 
 Drug Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA is a primary regulator of drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and other compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources in addition to the commitment of dedicated manufacturing, regulatory and compliance personnel, among others. Failure to comply with applicable requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject us to adverse consequences and administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications; withdrawal or restriction of an approval; imposition of a clinical hold or other limitation on both ongoing or future research; enforcement letters; product seizures; total or partial suspension of development, production, or distribution; or injunctions, fines, disgorgement, or civil or criminal payments or penalties. 
 The process required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal trials and formulation trials conducted according to Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements, animal welfare laws and other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials, meaning trials in human subjects, may begin in the United States, obtaining similar authorizations in other jurisdictions where clinical research will be conducted and maintaining these authorizations on a continuing basis throughout the time that trials are performed and new data are collected;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, requirements to demonstrate whether a proposed drug is safe and effective for its intended use;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a marketing authorization application, such as a new drug application, or NDA, and submitting similar marketing authorization applications in other jurisdictions where commercialization will be pursued;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or other marketing authorization application.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The development, testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and bears significant inherent risk that the individual products will not exhibit the relevant safety, effectiveness, or quality characteristics or that FDA, or any other regulatory authority, may interpret the data in a manner that does not support marketing approval or authorization. We cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or with the specific terms that we desire, if at all. 
 26


Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The drug initially is introduced into a small number of patients or human volunteers and information is collected pertaining to the drug’s safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. These trials are designed to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions, side effects with increasing doses and if possible, early evidence of effectiveness.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. Clinical trials include controlled clinical studies initiated in a limited target patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of the drug candidate for a particular indication in patients with the disease or condition under study, and to determine common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are expanded and controlled trials undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to gather additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk profile of the drug candidate and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling and regulatory approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A drug being studied in clinical trials may be made available to individual patients in certain circumstances.  Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, which was signed into law in December 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the later of 60 calendar days after the date of enactment of the Cures Act or the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug.
 Progress reports related to clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and participating institutional review boards, and more frequent safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and to investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, and certain other purposes. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all and study protocols may be amended or terminated by either the FDA or the sponsor. For example, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the healthy volunteers or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the investigational product apparently lacks efficacy. Similarly, an institutional review board can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements, including requirements to protect study subjects, or if the drug candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to healthy volunteers or patients. 
 We estimate that it generally takes 10 to 15 years, or possibly longer, to discover, develop and bring to market a new pharmaceutical product in the United States. Several years may be needed to complete each phase of development, including discovery, preclinical, Phase 1, 2 or 3, or marketing authorization. 
 At times during the development of a new drug product, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA. This commonly occurs prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 testing, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may also be requested. These meetings provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. For example, prior to initiating a Phase 3 study, sponsors have the option to submit a request for Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, to FDA which, if granted provides FDA’s concurrence that the study, if conducted as designed and if successful, could support a regulatory approval for the drug candidate. A plan for pediatric assessment also must be discussed at the end of the Phase 2 meeting. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing both the drug substance and finished drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the finished drug candidate, and the manufacturer must develop methods for confirming the identity, quality, purity, and potency of the final products. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability trials must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf-life and distribution pathway. 
 27


Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 
 Sponsors (or designated principal investigators) of clinical trials that are applicable clinical trials under the PHSA and the National Institute of Health’s recently published final rule regarding Clinical Trial Registration and Results information Submission are required to register their trials and disclose certain clinical trial information.  Phase 1 studies are not subject to these requirements.  Information related to the product, comparator, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of certain trials of unapproved new drugs that are still under development or new uses of approved drugs may be delayed, subject to limitations, until 30 calendar days after the new product or new indication being studied has been approved, or the marketing application has been withdrawn for a specified amount of time.  Where a new indication of a previously approved drug is sought, the submission of results information may also be delayed until 30 calendar days after FDA issues a letter that ends the review cycle for the application but does not approve the drug for the use studied in the clinical trial.  In addition, publication policies of major medical journals mandate certain registration and disclosures as a pre-condition for potential publication, even when this is not presently mandated as a matter of law. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
New Drug Application Review and Approval Processes 
 The results of drug candidate development, preclinical trials and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug candidate, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of a new drug application, or NDA, requesting approval to market the drug candidate. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees; a waiver of fees may be obtained under limited circumstances. 
 The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, NDAs are subject to substantial application user fees and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. Under PDUFA, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2018, the user fee for each NDA application requiring clinical data is $2,421,495. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug program fee of $304,162. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA reviews each NDA to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before it may be filed. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug candidate is safe and effective for its intended use and indication for use, including use of a drug as a combination therapy, and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the drug candidate’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee consisting of a panel of external experts for review and recommendation as to whether the NDA should be approved and under what conditions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the active ingredient and the formulated drug candidate are manufactured and tested. 
 The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable criteria are not satisfied, including if the manufacturing facilities fail to demonstrate cGMP compliance, or it may require additional preclinical, clinical or other data, such as manufacturing data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a Complete Response Letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its present form. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the Complete Response Letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases, dosages, or indications for use, which could restrict the commercial 
 28


value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain limitations of use, contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation, that are intended to increase agency interactions, expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing drug candidates, and/or provide for initial approval on the basis of surrogate or intermediate endpoints. We believe that PTI-428 and PTI-801 may qualify for some of these expedited development and review programs. Even if a drug candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later rescind such designation if it determines that the drug candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification as clinical data and the approved treatment landscape continue to evolve. 
 In January 2016, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the investigation of PTI-428 for the treatment of CF. Additionally, in February 2017, we applied for, and in March 2017 we were granted, Fast Track designation from the FDA for the investigation of PTI-801 for the treatment of CF. The Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and non-clinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the product (either alone or in combination with other drugs) and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available alternatives.   The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review with a goal review time frame of 6 months versus the standard 10 month standard review cycle for NDAs. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may qualify for accelerated approval if they demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM) (i.e., an intermediate endpoint), that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit.  As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. Failure to conduct required post-approval trials, or the inability to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing trials, may allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. In addition, the FDA presently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 also amended the FDCA to require FDA to expedite the development and review of a breakthrough therapy. A drug can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a drug be designated as a breakthrough therapy at any time during the clinical development of the product. If so designated, FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product’s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product’s 
 29


development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather nonclinical and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor, and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable. In March 2018, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for PTI-428 for the treatment of CF in homozygous patients for the F508del mutation who are receiving Orkambi® as background therapy.  The FDA may rescind such designation if our development program does not continue to meet the criteria for breakthrough therapy designation. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products for which we may receive future FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting and analysis of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety, efficacy and quality information, product sampling and distribution requirements, maintaining up-to-date labels, warnings, and contraindications, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements. Products may be promoted only for their approved indications and in accordance with their approved labels; products cannot be promoted for unapproved, or off-label, uses, although physicians may prescribe drugs for off-label uses in accordance with the practice of medicine. Manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to manufacturing processes often require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to, in some cases, extensive clinical development activities as well as further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at manufacturing sites that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market, such as adverse events, the existence or severity of which was unknown when the product was approved. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product’s approved uses or distribution or complete withdrawal from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, enforcement letters, holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal payments or penalties. 
 From time to time, new legislation is enacted that changes the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing, and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance may be revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory or policy changes will occur or be implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents, if issued, may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term to be extended up to five years as compensation for patent term effectively lost due to the FDA’s pre-market approval requirements. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is 
 30


eligible for the extension. Extensions are not granted as a matter of right and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent and within a 60-day period from the date the product is first approved for commercial marketing. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. Where a product contains multiple active ingredients, if any one active ingredient has not been previously approved, it can form the basis of an extension of patent term provided the patent claims that ingredient or the combination. 
 In the future, we may apply for patent term restoration for some of our presently owned patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The specific scope varies, but fundamentally the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity never previously approved by the FDA either alone or in combination. For a new chemical entity that was issued orphan drug designation, the FDCA provides marketing exclusivity for the “same drug” and “same indication” for a period of seven years. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the compound responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability trials, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical trials and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Pediatric Information and Exclusivity 
 Under the FDCA, NDAs and certain supplements to NDAs must contain data adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was signed into law on July 9, 2012, amended the FDCA. FDASIA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within 60 days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. 
Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drug candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that cost of research and development of the drug for the indication can be recovered by sales of the 
 31


drug in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Although there may be some increased communication opportunities, orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in very limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of our drug candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidates are determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. 
 The Orphan Products Grants Program in the FDA’s Office of Orphan Products Development, with an annual budget of approximately $15.5 million, supports clinical development of products including drugs, biologics, medical devices and medical foods for use in rare diseases and conditions where no therapy exists or where the proposed product will be superior to the existing therapy. This program provides grants for clinical studies on safety and/or effectiveness that will either result in, or substantially contribute to, market approval of these products. 
 From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of drug products. For example, as FDA works to implement its authorities under the 21st Century Cures Act and FDA Reauthorization Act relating to modernization of clinical trial design, endpoints, and incorporation of patient experience data and real-world evidence in new drug development, FDA’s expectations of sponsor drug development activities may change.  In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or reviewing courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and development of our product candidates and any products that we may commercialize. It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, or what the impact of any such changes may be. Federal budget uncertainties or spending reductions may reduce the capabilities of the FDA, extend the duration of required regulatory reviews, and reduce the availability of clinical research grants. 
 As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a drug candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in the European Union enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product. 
 The FDA and foreign regulators expect holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the orphan drug.
 In March 2018, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation for PTI-428. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement 
 United States 
 Even if the FDA approves NDAs for our drug candidates, sales of our products will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial or private insurance, and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be 
 32


approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 European Union 
 In Europe and many other foreign countries, the success of our drug candidates we may develop depends largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement, because in many foreign countries patients are unlikely to use prescription pharmaceutical products that are not reimbursed by their governments. Negotiating reimbursement rates in foreign countries can delay the commercialization of a pharmaceutical product and generally results in a reimbursement rate that is lower than the net price that companies can obtain for the same product in the United States. 
 In some countries, such as Germany, commercial sales of a product can begin while the reimbursement rate that a company will receive in future periods is under discussion. In other countries, a company must complete the reimbursement discussions prior to the commencement of commercial sales of the pharmaceutical product. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of drugs for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the drug or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug on the market. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries. 
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 Pharmaceutical companies also are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, and the reporting of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, ACA, was enacted, which includes measures that have or will significantly change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of ACA of greatest importance to the biopharmaceutical industry are the following: 

• | The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs and biologic products from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, expanded Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well. In addition, ACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 33


 
Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by the CMS may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition of cost data, which could negatively impact our sales.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the present state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ACA imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs and biologic products to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D patients in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ACA imposed an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As part of efforts to further transparency of payments made by pharmaceutical companies to physicians, ACA required manufacturers to track certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including any “transfer of value” made or distributed to such entities, as well as any ownership interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers are required to report this information annually to CMS. Records of payments and ownership interests are publicly available for review on the CMS website.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute was established pursuant to ACA to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ACA created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. ACA provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, that while not a law, is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of ACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of ACA that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of ACA that are repealed. Thus, the full impact of ACA, any law replacing elements of it, or the political uncertainty related to any repeal or replacement legislation on our business remains unclear.

Anti-kickback Laws 
 U.S. federal laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, and the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and various state agencies. These anti-kickback laws prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program. Remuneration is broadly defined to include anything of value, such as cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies, or equipment. The anti-kickback laws are broad and prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare and biopharmaceutical industry. A person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The penalties for violating the anti-kickback laws can be severe. The sanctions include criminal and civil penalties, and possible exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal anti-kickback laws, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payor, including third-party payors. 
 Federal and State Prohibitions on False Claims 
 The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment under federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information. Although we would not submit claims directly to government payors, manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. 
 Provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action. The number of filings under these provisions has increased significantly in recent years. Conduct that violates the False Claims Act may also lead to exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. In addition, various states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state healthcare programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to all payers. 
 Federal Prohibitions on Healthcare Fraud and False Statements Related to Healthcare Matters 
 There are numerous federal and state laws protecting the privacy and security of protected health information. Additionally, a number of related crimes can be prosecuted related to healthcare fraud, false statements relating to healthcare matters, theft or embezzlement in connection with a health benefit program, and obstruction of criminal investigation of healthcare offenses. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including a private insurer. Violation of any of these laws is a felony and may result in fines or exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. 
Physician Payment Sunshine Act 
 The Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires most pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to the Secretary of HHS any and all financial arrangements, payments, or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals. The payment information is made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website. Over the next several years, we will need to dedicate significant resources to establish and maintain systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties. Similar laws have been enacted or are under consideration in foreign jurisdictions, including France which has adopted the Loi Bertrand, or French Sunshine Act, which became effective in 2013. 
 35


The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
Other Regulations 
 In addition to the statutes and regulations described above, we also are subject to regulation in the United States under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations, now or hereafter in effect. 
Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials, distribution, and future commercial sales of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug candidate, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we can commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter and potentially more rigorous than that required for FDA approval. Clinical studies conducted to support a submission for FDA approval may be inadequate to support a submission for marketing approval or authorization outside the United States and additional clinical studies may be required, such as studies that enroll subjects located in the jurisdiction where the sponsor seeks regulatory approval.  
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegeneration, or diabetes and optional for those medicines that are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether or not to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 
 Employees 
 As of February 28, 2018, we employed 50 full-time employees, including 39 in research and development and 11 in general and administrative, and two part-time employees. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective-bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
