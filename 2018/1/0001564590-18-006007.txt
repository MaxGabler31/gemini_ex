ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Corporate Information 
 We were incorporated in Minnesota in 1998 under the name of GCI Lakes, Inc., which name was subsequently changed to Lakes Gaming, Inc. in August 1998, to Lakes Entertainment, Inc. in June 2002 and to Golden Entertainment, Inc. in July 2015. Our shares began trading publicly in January 1999. The mailing address of our headquarters is 6595 S Jones Boulevard, Las Vegas, Nevada 89118, and our telephone number at that location is (702) 893-7777.
Business Overview
 We own and operate a diversified entertainment platform, consisting of a portfolio of gaming assets that focus on resort casino operations and distributed gaming (including tavern gaming in our wholly-owned taverns). 
 We conduct our business through two reportable operating segments: Casinos and Distributed Gaming. In our Casinos segment, we own and operate eight resort casinos, seven in Nevada and one in Maryland. Four of our Nevada resort casino properties were added to our casino portfolio in October 2017 as a result of our acquisition of American, as further described below. Our Distributed Gaming segment involves the installation, maintenance and operation of slots and amusement devices in non-casino locations such as grocery stores, convenience stores, liquor stores, restaurants, bars and taverns in Nevada and Montana, and the operation of wholly-owned branded taverns targeting local patrons located primarily in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area. Financial information regarding our reporting segments is included in Note 16, Segment Information, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 In January 2018, subsequent to fiscal year end, we completed an underwritten public offering in which certain of our shareholders resold an aggregate of 6.5 million shares of our common stock, and we sold 975,000 newly issued shares of our common stock pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ over-allotment option to purchase additional shares. Our net proceeds from the offering were approximately $25.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. We expect to use these net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, capital expenditures, opportunistic acquisitions or working capital.
 Acquisitions
 On October 20, 2017, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of American from its former equity holders (the “American Acquisition”) for aggregate consideration consisting of $781.0 million in cash (subject to certain post-closing adjustments pursuant to the purchase agreement) and the issuance by us of 4,046,494 shares of our common stock to W2007/ACEP Holdings, LLC (“ACEP Holdings”), a former American equity holder. Pursuant to the post-closing adjustment provisions in the purchase agreement, the cash portion of the consideration paid in the American Acquisition was subsequently increased to $787.6 million. The American Acquisition added four Nevada resort casino properties to our casino portfolio, including the Stratosphere Casino, Hotel & Tower (the “Stratosphere”) in Las Vegas. The results of operations of American and its subsidiaries have been included in our results subsequent to that date. See Note 3, Merger and Acquisitions, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. In connection with the closing of the American Acquisition, we entered into two new credit agreements with respect to a $900.0 million senior secured first lien credit facility (consisting of $800.0 million in term loans and a $100.0 million revolving credit facility, which was undrawn at closing) and a $200.0 million senior secured second lien term loan facility. We used the net proceeds from the borrowings under these facilities at the closing primarily to fund the cash purchase price in the American Acquisition (a portion of which was used to repay American’s then outstanding senior secured indebtedness), to refinance our outstanding senior secured indebtedness under our then-existing senior secured credit facility, and to pay certain transaction fees and expenses. See Note 7, Debt, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the new credit agreements and associated refinancing.
 In January 2016, we completed the acquisition of approximately 1,100 slots from a distributed gaming operator in Montana, as well as certain other non-gaming assets and the right to operate within certain locations (the “Initial Montana Acquisition”). Additionally, in April 2016, we completed the acquisition of approximately 1,800 slots from a second distributed gaming operator in Montana, as well as amusement devices and other non-gaming assets and 
 2


the right to operate within certain locations (the “Second Montana Acquisition” and, together with the Initial Montana Acquisition, the “Montana Acquisitions”). The results of operations of the distributed gaming businesses acquired in the Montana Acquisitions have been included in our results subsequent to their respective acquisition dates. See Note 3, Merger and Acquisitions, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.
 On July 31, 2015, we acquired Sartini Gaming, Inc. (“Sartini Gaming”) through the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of Golden with and into Sartini Gaming, with Sartini Gaming surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Golden (the “Merger”). The results of operations of Sartini Gaming and its subsidiaries have been included in our results subsequent to that date.
 Casinos
 We own and operate eight resort casino properties in Nevada and Maryland, comprising the Stratosphere, Arizona Charlie’s Decatur and Arizona Charlie’s Boulder in Las Vegas, Nevada, the Aquarius Casino Resort (the “Aquarius”) in Laughlin, Nevada, the Pahrump Nugget Hotel Casino (“Pahrump Nugget”), Gold Town Casino and Lakeside Casino & RV Park in Pahrump, Nevada, and the Rocky Gap Casino Resort (“Rocky Gap”) in Flintstone, Maryland.

Distributed Gaming 
 Our Distributed Gaming segment involves the installation, maintenance and operation of slots and amusement devices in non-casino locations such as grocery stores, convenience stores, liquor stores, restaurants, bars and taverns in Nevada and Montana. In addition, we operate wholly-owned branded taverns with slots, which target local patrons, primarily in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area. We also hold a video gaming terminal operator license for distributed gaming in Illinois. We place our slots and amusement devices in locations where we believe they will receive maximum customer traffic, generally near a store’s entrance. As of December 31, 2017, our distributed gaming operations comprised approximately 10,900 slots in over 1,000 locations. 
 Nevada law limits distributed gaming operations (also known as “restricted gaming” operations) to certain types of non-casino locations, including grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, restaurants, bars, taverns and liquor stores, where gaming is incidental to the primary business being conducted at the location and games are generally limited to 15 or fewer slots and no other forms of gaming activity. The gaming area in these business locations is typically small, and in many instances, segregated from the primary business area, including the use of alcoves in grocery stores and drug stores and installation of slots into the physical bar (also known as “bar top” slots) in bars and taverns. Such segregation provides greater oversight and supervision of the slots. Under Montana law, distributed gaming operations are limited to business locations licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption only, with such locations generally restricted to offering a maximum of 20 slots.
 In Nevada, we generally enter into three types of slot placement contracts as part of our distributed gaming business: space lease, revenue share and participation agreements. Under space lease agreements, we pay a fixed monthly rental fee for the right to install, maintain and operate our slots at a business location. Under revenue share agreements, we pay the business location a percentage of the gaming revenue generated from our slots placed at the location, rather than a fixed monthly rental fee. With regard to both space lease and revenue share agreements, we hold the applicable gaming license to conduct gaming at the location (although revenue share locations are required to obtain separate regulatory approval to receive a percentage of the gaming revenue). Under participation agreements, the business location holds the applicable gaming license and retains a percentage of the gaming revenue that it generates from our slots. In Montana, our slot and amusement device placement contracts are all revenue share agreements.
 Our wholly-owned branded taverns offer a casual, upscale environment catering to local patrons offering superior food, craft beer and other alcoholic beverages, and typically include 15 onsite slots. As of December 31, 2017, we operated 57 wholly-owned branded taverns, which offered a total of over 920 onsite slots. Most of our taverns are located in the greater Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area and cater to local patrons seeking more convenient entertainment establishments than traditional casino properties. Our tavern brands include PT’s Gold, PT’s Pub, Sierra Gold, Sean Patrick’s, PT’s Place, PT’s Ranch, PT’s Brewing Company, Sierra Junction and SG Bar. We also opened our first brewery in Las Vegas, PT’s Brewing Company, during the first quarter of 2016 to produce craft beer for our taverns and casinos. 
 Sales and Marketing
 Casinos
 Our Nevada resort casinos are located in Las Vegas, Laughlin and Pahrump, Nevada, and include the Stratosphere casino property located on the north end of the Las Vegas Strip. Accordingly, we market our Nevada resort casino properties to both the locals market and tourist traffic, targeting the value-driven customer. We seek to attract local residents to our Nevada casinos through promotions geared towards enhancing local play, including dining offerings at our casino restaurants and promotions of our bowling and bingo amenities. Promotional programs for out-of-market patrons focus primarily on our iconic Stratosphere casino property, our newly remodeled hotel rooms at Pahrump Nugget and our award-winning recreational vehicle park surrounding a lake at the Lakeside Casino & RV Park.
 Rocky Gap is located in western Maryland in close proximity to the affluent and heavily populated metropolitan areas of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Baltimore, Maryland and Washington, D.C., as well as two major interstate freeways. Rocky Gap serves as a premier destination for both local and out-of-market patrons. Our marketing efforts for Rocky Gap are primarily focused on attracting patrons through local and regional campaigns promoting both the amenities of Rocky Gap and the vast array of outdoor activities available in the Rocky Gap State Park. A portion of Rocky Gap’s business is also arranged through group sales and bus coach wholesalers.

Our casino sales and marketing efforts also include various rewards and loyalty programs designed to encourage repeat business at our resort casino properties. At our Las Vegas and Laughlin casinos in Nevada, we offer the ace|PLAY® rewards program. At our Pahrump, Nevada casinos, we offer the Gold Mine RewardsTM loyalty program. The close proximity of our Pahrump casino properties allows us to leverage the convenience of a one-card player rewards system, where reward points and other benefits can be earned and redeemed across all three of our Pahrump casinos via a single card. At Rocky Gap, we offer the Rewards ClubTM loyalty program. Depending on the program, members of our rewards programs may earn points based on gaming activity and amounts spent on rooms, food, beverage and resort activities, which points may be redeemable for complimentary slot play, food, beverages and hotel rooms, among other items. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 700,000 active players in our marketing database, providing cross-marketing opportunities across our resort casino and distributed gaming platform.
 
Distributed Gaming 
 We conduct our operations in our Distributed Gaming segment in Nevada and Montana. Our Distributed Gaming customer base is comprised of the third party distributed gaming customers with whom we enter into slot and amusement device placement contracts for the installation, maintenance and operation of slots and amusement devices at non-casino locations, the primarily local patrons that use our slots and amusement devices in such locations and the primarily local patrons of our wholly-owned branded taverns. We seek to place our slots and amusement devices in strategic, high-traffic areas, including in our branded taverns, and the majority of our marketing efforts are focused on maximizing profitability from a high-frequency, convenience-driven customer base in the counties in which we operate. 
 Our marketing efforts also seek to capitalize on repeat visitation through the use of loyalty programs, such as our Golden Rewards® promotional program for our wholly-owned branded taverns. Members of our Golden Rewards programs earn points based on play and amounts spent on the purchase of food and beverage, which points are redeemable for complimentary slot play, food and beverages and other items. Our rewards technology is designed to track customer behavior indicators such as visitation, customer spend and customer engagement. Brand equity is also leveraged in our taverns through the number of our branded tavern locations located throughout the greater Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area. Our advertising initiatives include both traditional and non-traditional channels such as direct mail, email, radio, print, television, social media, search engine optimization and static/dynamic billboards. 
 Intellectual Property
 Our policy is to pursue registration of our important trademarks and service marks in the states where we do business and with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have registered and/or have pending as trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, among other trademarks and service marks, “Golden Entertainment” and “Golden Gaming,” as well as various names, brands and logos relating to our resort casino properties, customer rewards and loyalty programs and wholly-owned taverns. In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks in various jurisdictions in the United States in connection with our properties, facilities and development projects. We also hold a patent in the United States related to player tracking systems. 
Sale of Jamul Tribe Promissory Note
 On December 9, 2015, we sold our $60.0 million subordinated promissory note (the “Jamul Note”) from the Jamul Indian Village (the “Jamul Tribe”) to a subsidiary of Penn National Gaming, Inc. (“Penn National”) for $24.0 million in cash. Under the terms of the January 2015 merger agreement with Sartini Gaming (the “Merger Agreement”) and subject to applicable law, we agreed that the proceeds received from the sale of the Jamul Note, net of related costs, would be distributed in a special cash dividend to our shareholders holding shares as of the record date for such dividend (other than shareholders that had waived their right to receive such dividend in connection with the Merger). On June 17, 2016, our Board of Directors approved and declared the special dividend to the eligible shareholders of record on the close of business on June 30, 2016 (the “Record Date”) of cash in the aggregate amount of approximately $23.5 million (the “Special Dividend”), which was paid on July 14, 2016. The 
 5


$1.71 per share amount of the Special Dividend was calculated by dividing the aggregate amount of the Special Dividend by 13,759,374 outstanding shares of common stock held by eligible shareholders on the Record Date (rounded down to the nearest whole cent per share).
 In connection with the special dividend and in accordance with our equity incentive plans approved by our shareholders, equitable anti-dilutive adjustments were made to the exercise prices of outstanding stock options to purchase shares of our common stock in order to preserve the value of such stock options following the Special Dividend. Accordingly, effective as of the close of business on the dividend payment date of July 14, 2016, the exercise price of each stock option under our equity incentive plans outstanding on the Record Date was reduced by $1.71 per share. See Note 9, Share-Based Compensation, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on our anti-dilutive adjustments to the outstanding stock options. 
 Competition 
 The resort casino and distributed gaming industries are highly competitive. Our resort casino business competes with numerous casinos and casino-hotels of varying quality and size in our markets. We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation destinations, and with various other casino and other entertainment businesses. The casino entertainment business is characterized by competitors that vary considerably in their size, quality of facilities, number of operations, brand identities, marketing and growth strategies, financial strength and capabilities, level of amenities, management talent and geographic diversity. Many of our regional and national competitors have greater brand recognition and significantly greater resources than we have. Their greater resources may also provide them with the ability to expand operations in the future.
 Furthermore, several states are currently considering legalizing casino gaming in designated areas, and Native American tribes may develop or expand gaming properties in markets located more closely to our customer base (particularly Native American casinos located in California). The expansion of casino gaming in or near any geographic area from which we attract or expect to attract a significant number of our customers, including legalized casino gaming in neighboring states and on Native American land, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 With respect to our distributed gaming businesses, we face direct competition for our space lease, revenue share and participation locations from others involved in the distributed gaming business, as well as substantial competition for customers from other operators of casinos, hotels, taverns and other entertainment venues. Many of our regional and national competitors have greater brand recognition and significantly greater resources than we have. Their greater resources may also provide them with the ability to expand operations in the future.
 In addition, in both of our segments we face ever-increasing competition from online gaming, including mobile gaming applications for smart phones and tablet computers, state-sponsored lotteries, card clubs, sports books, fantasy sports websites and other forms of legalized gaming. Various forms of internet gaming have been approved in Nevada, and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states. The expansion of internet gaming in Nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition for our operations.
 Regulation 
 Gaming Regulation
 We are subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulation. State and local government authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate require us to obtain gaming licenses and require our officers, key employees and business entity affiliates to demonstrate suitability to be involved in gaming operations. These are privileged licenses or approvals which are not guaranteed by statute or regulation. State and local government authorities may limit, condition, suspend or revoke a license, impose substantial fines, and take other actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain and maintain the gaming licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our gaming operations. Any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and 
 6


prospects. Furthermore, if additional gaming laws or regulations are adopted, these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us and our business. For additional information, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business is subject to extensive gaming regulation, which is costly to comply with, and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations.”
 Gaming authorities may, in their sole and absolute discretion, require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications, be investigated, and be found suitable to own our securities if they have reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of their respective states. Further, the costs of any investigation conducted by any gaming authority under these circumstances is typically required to be paid by the applicant, and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities. Our articles of incorporation require our shareholders to cooperate with gaming authorities in such investigations and permit us to redeem the securities held by any shareholder whose holding of shares of our capital stock may result, in the judgment of our board of directors, in our failure to obtain or our loss of any license or franchise from any governmental agency held by us to conduct any portion of our business. If any gaming authority determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities, then, under the applicable gaming laws and regulations, we can be sanctioned, including the loss of our privileged licenses or approvals, if, without the prior approval of the applicable gaming authority, we conduct certain business with the unsuitable person. For additional information, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our shareholders are subject to extensive government regulation and, if a shareholder is found unsuitable by a gaming authority, that shareholder would not be able to beneficially own our common stock directly or indirectly. Our shareholders may also be required to provide information that is required by gaming authorities and we have the right, under certain circumstances, to redeem a shareholder’s securities; we may be forced to use our cash or incur debt to fund redemption of our securities.”
 Our directors, officers and key employees are also subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various privileged licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. If any gaming authority with jurisdiction over our business were to find any of our directors, officers or key employees unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever our relationship with that person. Furthermore, such gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and prospects.
 Applicable gaming laws and regulations also restrict our ability to issue securities, incur debt, and undertake other financing activities. Such transactions would generally require approval of gaming authorities, and our financing counterparties, including lenders, might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. If state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his, her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person, which could materially adversely affect our business. 
 The gaming industry also represents a significant source of tax revenue, particularly to the State of Nevada and its counties and municipalities. From time to time, various federal, state and local legislators and other government officials have proposed and adopted changes in tax laws, or in the administration or interpretation of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. It is not possible to determine the likelihood of possible changes in tax laws or in the administration or interpretation of such laws. Such changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. For additional information, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Changes to gaming tax laws could increase our cost of doing business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.”
 From time to time, local and state lawmakers, as well as special interest groups, have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any such change to the regulatory environment or the adoption of new federal, state or local government legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 Other Regulation 
 Our business is subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and 
 7


advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Changes to any of the laws, rules, regulations or ordinances to which we are subject, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to emissions and discharges into the environment, and the storage, handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. These laws and regulations are complex, and subject to change, and violations can lead to significant costs for corrective action and remediation, fines and penalties. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating contamination on its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants, and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time that they occurred, as well as incur liability to third parties impacted by such contamination. The presence of contamination, or failure to remediate it properly, may adversely affect our ability to use, sell or rent property. As we acquire additional casino, resort and tavern properties, such as the casino properties we acquired in the American Acquisition, we may not know the full level of exposure that we may have undertaken despite appropriate due diligence. We endeavor to maintain compliance with environmental laws, but from time to time, current or historical operations on or adjacent to, our properties may have resulted or may result in noncompliance with environmental laws or liability for cleanup pursuant to environmental laws. In that regard, we may incur costs for cleaning up contamination relating to historical uses of certain of our properties.
 Many of our employees, especially those that interact with our customers, receive a base salary or wage that is established by applicable state and federal laws that establish a minimum hourly wage that is, in turn, supplemented through tips and gratuities from customers. In February and April 2017, several former employees filed two separate purported class action lawsuits against us and on behalf of similarly situated individuals employed by us in Nevada. The lawsuits allege that we violated certain Nevada labor laws, including payment of an hourly wage below the statutory minimum wage without providing a qualified health insurance plan and an associated failure to pay proper overtime compensation. For additional information, please see Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings.” From time to time, state and federal lawmakers have increased the minimum wage. It is difficult to predict when such increases may take place. Any such change to the minimum wage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 The manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages is a highly regulated and taxed business. Our brewery operations at PT’s Brewing Company in Las Vegas, Nevada require federal, state, and local licenses, permits and approvals. Our restaurant and on-site brewery at PT’s Brewing Company operate pursuant to exceptions to the “tied house” laws, which in Nevada generally prohibit a manufacturer or supplier of brewery products from engaging in the business of wholesaling and prevent a wholesaler from engaging, directly or indirectly, in retail sales. Our brewery operations are subject to more restrictive regulations and increased taxation by federal, state and local governmental entities than are those of non-alcohol related beverage businesses. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the production and distribution of beer, including permitting, licensing, trade practices, labeling, advertising, marketing, distributor relationships and related matters. Federal, state and local governmental entities also levy various taxes, license fees, and other similar charges and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations could result in higher taxes, penalties, fees, and suspension or revocation of permits, licenses or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. From time to time, local and state lawmakers, as well as special interest groups, have proposed legislation that would increase the federal and/or state excise tax on alcoholic beverages or certain types of alcoholic beverages. If adopted, such measures could affect some or all of our proprietary craft beer production. If federal or state excise taxes are increased, we may have to raise prices to maintain our current profit margins. Higher taxes may reduce overall demand for beer, thus negatively impacting sales of our beer. Further federal or state regulation may be forthcoming that could further restrict the distribution and sale of alcohol products. Any material increase in taxes or fees, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 8


In addition, each restaurant we operate must obtain a food service license from local authorities. Failure to comply with such regulations could cause our licenses to be revoked or our related restaurant business or businesses to be forced to cease operations. Moreover, state liquor laws may prevent the expansion of restaurant operations into certain markets.
 Seasonality
 We believe that our Casinos and Distributed Gaming segments are affected by seasonal factors, including holidays, weather and travel conditions. Our casinos and distributed gaming businesses in Nevada have historically experienced lower revenues during the summer as a result of fewer tourists due to higher temperatures, as well as increased vacation activity by local residents. Rocky Gap typically experiences higher revenues during summer months and may be significantly adversely impacted by inclement weather during winter months. Our Nevada distributed gaming operations typically experience higher revenues during the fall which corresponds with several professional sports seasons. Our Montana distributed gaming operations typically experience higher revenues during the fall due to the inclement weather in the state and less opportunity for outdoor activities, in addition to the impact from professional sports seasons. While other factors like unemployment levels, market competition and the diversification of our business may either offset or magnify seasonal effects, some seasonality is likely to continue, which could result in significant fluctuation in our quarterly operating results.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 6,910 employees, of which approximately 2,000 were covered by various collective bargaining agreements. Other unions may seek to organize the workers of our resort casino properties from time to time. We historically have had good relationships with the unions representing our employees and believe that our employee relations are good. 
 At the Stratosphere, three collective bargaining agreements cover our employees. Our collective bargaining agreement with the Professional, Clerical and Miscellaneous Employees, Teamsters Local Union 986 expires on March 31, 2018. Our collective bargaining agreement with the Culinary Workers Union, Local 226 and Bartenders Union, Local 165 expires on May 31, 2018. Our collective bargaining agreement with the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 501, AFL-CIO expires on March 31, 2018.
 At the Aquarius, four collective bargaining agreements cover our employees. Our collective bargaining agreement with the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 501, AFL-CIO expires on March 31, 2020. Our collective bargaining agreement with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artist and Allied Crafts of the United States, Its Territories and Canada, Local 720, Las Vegas, Nevada expires on November 30, 2022. Our collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers of America expires on April 1, 2018. Our collective bargaining agreement with the Security, Police, and Fire Professional of America expires on February 28, 2021.
 At Rocky Gap, our collective bargaining agreement with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local 27 expires on November 1, 2019.
