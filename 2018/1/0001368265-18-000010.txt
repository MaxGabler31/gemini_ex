Item 1.    Business
Overview
We are the leading provider of natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets in the United States and Canada, based on the number of stations operated and the amount of gasoline gallon equivalents ("GGEs") of RNG, CNG and LNG delivered. 
Our principal business is supplying RNG, CNG and LNG (RNG can be delivered in the form of CNG or LNG) for light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles and providing operation and maintenance ("O&M") services for vehicle fleet customer stations. As a comprehensive solution provider, we also design, build, operate and maintain fueling stations; sell and service natural gas fueling compressors and other equipment used in CNG stations and LNG stations; offer assessment, design and modification solutions to provide operators with code-compliant service and maintenance facilities for natural gas vehicle fleets; transport and sell CNG and LNG via “virtual” natural gas pipelines and interconnects; procure and sell RNG; sell tradable credits we generate by selling RNG and conventional natural gas as a vehicle fuel, including RIN Credits and LCFS Credits; help our customers acquire and finance natural gas vehicles; and obtain federal, state and local credits, grants and incentives. 
We serve fleet vehicle operators in a variety of markets, including heavy-duty trucking, airports, refuse, public transit, industrial and institutional energy users, and government fleets. We believe these fleet markets will continue to present a growth opportunity for natural gas vehicle fuel for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2017, we serve nearly 1,000 fleet customers operating over 46,000 natural gas vehicles, and we own, operate or supply over 530 natural gas fueling stations in 42 states in the United States and four provinces in Canada. We estimate this number of stations is approximately four times the number of CNG fueling stations operated by our largest competitor in today’s market, and we believe our natural gas fueling operations cover more states and provinces than any of our competitors. We believe we are the only company in the United States or Canada that provides both CNG and LNG vehicle fuel on a significant scale.
Market for Natural Gas as a Vehicle Fuel
Natural Gas Vehicles for America ("NGV America") estimates that, as of December 31, 2017, there were approximately 1,750 natural gas fueling stations in the United States and 153,000 natural gas vehicles on American roads, including approximately 39,500 heavy -duty vehicles (such as heavy -duty trucks, refuse trucks and buses), 25,800 medium-duty vehicles (such as delivery vans and shuttles) and 87,000 light-duty vehicles (such as passenger cars, small utility vehicles, trucks and vans).
We believe the following benefits of natural gas fuel may encourage the development of the market for RNG and conventional natural gas as a vehicle fuel in the United States:
Domestic and Plentiful Supply.    Technological advances in natural gas drilling and production, including the widespread deployment of horizontal drilling techniques and the use of hydraulic fracturing, have unlocked vast natural gas reserves. The United States has proven, abundant and growing reserves of natural gas, and produces the highest volume of natural gas in the world.
Less Expensive.    Due to the abundance of natural gas, the cost of natural gas in the United States is less than the cost of crude oil on an energy equivalent basis. Based on projections from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, we believe natural gas will remain cheaper than gasoline and diesel for the foreseeable future. In addition, because the price of the natural gas commodity makes up a smaller portion of the cost of a GGE of CNG or LNG relative to the commodity portion of the cost of a GGE of diesel or gasoline, the price of a GGE of CNG or LNG is less sensitive to increases in the underlying commodity cost.
Cleaner.    Natural gas contains less carbon than any other fossil fuel and, as a result, produces fewer carbon dioxide emissions when burned.  The California Air Resources Board ("CARB") has concluded that a vehicle fueled by natural gas has fewer greenhouse gas emissions than a comparable vehicle fueled by gasoline or diesel, on a well-to-wheel basis. Additionally, a study from Argonne National Laboratory, a research laboratory operated by the University of Chicago for the U.S. Department of Energy, indicates that natural gas vehicles produce between 13% and 21% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than comparable gasoline- and diesel -fueled vehicles.
We believe RNG vehicle fuel has enhanced environmental benefits relative to gasoline and diesel vehicle fuels. For natural gas vehicles that run on RNG we estimate, based on CARB data, that the greenhouse gas emissions produced are between 50% and 125% less than comparable gasoline- and diesel -fueled vehicles, depending on the source of the RNG. We believe the RNG we sell for use as a vehicle fuel, which is distributed under the brand name Redeem, is the first commercially available RNG vehicle fuel made from organic waste.

We believe the relative environmental benefits of natural gas as a vehicle fuel could become increasingly important if, as we expect, air quality regulations become increasingly stringent, new regulations mandating low carbon fuels are enacted and fleet operators expand their initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions and increase fuel diversity.
Safer.    As reported by NGV America, CNG and LNG are relatively safer than gasoline and diesel because they dissipate into the air when spilled or in the event of a vehicle accident. When released, CNG and LNG are also less combustible than gasoline or diesel because they ignite only at relatively high temperatures. The fuel tanks and systems used in natural gas vehicles are subjected to a number of federally required safety tests, such as fire, environmental hazard, burst pressure and crash testing, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. CNG and LNG are stored in above-ground tanks and therefore will not contaminate soil or groundwater in the event of a spill or leak. 
Natural Gas Vehicles
Natural gas vehicles use internal combustion engines similar to those used in gasoline- or diesel -powered vehicles, and the acceleration and other performance characteristics of natural gas vehicles are also similar to those of gasoline- or diesel -powered vehicles of the same weight and engine class. Natural gas vehicles, whether they run on CNG or LNG, are refueled using a hose and nozzle that makes an airtight seal with the vehicle’s fuel tank.
Natural gas vehicles also have engines specially tuned to run on natural gas fuels, which have higher octane content than gasoline or diesel, and fuel tanks and lines specially designed to hold CNG and LNG and deliver it to the vehicle’s engine. These special features, including primarily the fuel tanks that hold CNG and LNG, cause natural gas vehicles to typically cost more than comparable gasoline- or diesel-powered vehicles. Additionally, for heavy-duty vehicles, spark ignited natural gas vehicles generally operate more quietly than comparable diesel-powered vehicles.
Virtually any car, truck, bus or other vehicle is capable of being manufactured or modified to run on natural gas. Many types and models of heavy-, medium- and light- duty natural gas vehicles and engines are available in the United States and Canada, including, among others, long-haul tractors, refuse trucks, regional tractors, transit buses, ready-mix trucks, delivery trucks, vocational work trucks, school buses, shuttles, passenger sedans, pickup trucks and cargo and passenger vans. We expect additional types and models of natural gas vehicles will become available if adoption of RNG and conventional natural gas as a vehicle fuel becomes more widespread in the United States.
Our Products, Services and Other Business Activities
Our principal products, services and business activities are described below. Information about the revenue we receive from these activities is discussed in this report in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
CNG Sales.    CNG is natural gas that is compressed and dispensed in gaseous form. CNG is typically delivered by obtaining natural gas from local utilities or third-party marketers and then compressing and storing it at a fueling station and dispensing it directly into a vehicle. Some of the natural gas we obtain from third parties for CNG sales is purchased under take-or-pay contracts that require us to purchase minimum volumes of natural gas.
We sell CNG for use as a vehicle fuel through fueling stations located on our customers' properties and through our network of public access fueling stations. Our CNG vehicle fuel sales are made primarily through contracts with our customers. Under many of these contracts, pricing is determined on an index-plus basis, which is calculated by adding a margin and delivery cost to the local index or utility price for natural gas. As a result, CNG vehicle fuel sales determined by an index-plus methodology increase or decrease as a result of an increase or decrease in the cost of natural gas, including transportation charges, utility costs and other fees. The remainder of our CNG vehicle fuel sales are made on a per fill-up basis at prices we set at public access stations based on prevailing market conditions.
Through our subsidiary NG Advantage, LLC (“NG Advantage”), we also transport and sell CNG for non-vehicle purposes via virtual natural gas pipelines and interconnects. NG Advantage transports CNG to industrial and institutional energy users that do not have direct access to natural gas pipelines. NG Advantage also transports CNG between pipelines for customers that desire to take advantage of commodity price differences. NG Advantage uses a fleet of 94 high-capacity tube trailers to transport CNG and we anticipate that NG Advantage may need to purchase or lease additional trailers in the future to transport CNG in support of its operations.
LNG Production and Sales.    LNG is natural gas that is cooled at a liquefaction facility to approximately -260 degrees Fahrenheit until it condenses into a liquid. We obtain LNG from our own liquefaction plants and from third -party suppliers. We own and operate LNG liquefaction plants near Houston, Texas and Boron, California, which we call the "Pickens Plant" and the "Boron Plant," respectively. The Pickens Plant has the capacity to produce 35.0 million gallons of LNG per year and includes a tanker trailer loading system and a 1.0 million gallon storage tank that can hold up to 840,000 usable gallons. The Boron Plant is 
5

capable of producing 60.0 million gallons of LNG per year and has a dual tanker trailer loading system and a 1.8 million gallon storage tank that can hold up to 1.5 million usable gallons. In 2017, we purchased 39% of our LNG from third-party suppliers and we produced the remainder of our LNG at the Pickens Plant and the Boron Plant. Some of the natural gas we obtain from third parties for LNG sales is purchased under take-or-pay contracts that require us to purchase minimum volumes of natural gas.
We sell LNG for use as a vehicle fuel on a bulk basis to fleet customers, who often own and operate their fueling stations, and through our network of public access fueling stations. We deliver LNG via our fleet of 84 tanker trailers to fueling stations, where it is stored and then dispensed in liquid form into vehicles. We contract with third parties to provide tractors and drivers. The need to liquefy and transport LNG generally causes LNG to cost more than CNG. We sell LNG through supply contracts that are priced on an index-plus basis, such that LNG sales under these contracts increase or decrease as a result of an increase or decrease in the cost of natural gas. We also sell LNG vehicle fuel on a per fill-up basis at prices we set at public access stations based on prevailing market conditions. Additionally, we sell LNG for non-vehicle purposes, including to customers who use LNG in oil fields, and for industrial, utility, marine and rail applications.
O&M Services.   We perform O&M services for CNG and LNG fueling stations that we do not own. For these services, we generally charge a fixed or a per-gallon fee based on the volume of fuel dispensed at the station. We have an operations team that performs preventive maintenance and is available to respond to service requests.
AFTC. Under separate pieces of U.S. federal legislation, we have been eligible to receive the AFTC alternative fuels tax credit for our natural gas vehicle fuel sales made between October 1, 2006 and December 31, 2017. The AFTC credit is equal to $0.50 per gasoline gallon equivalent of CNG that we sold as vehicle fuel, $0.50 per liquid gallon of LNG that we sold as vehicle fuel through 2015, and $0.50 per diesel gallon equivalent of LNG that we sold as vehicle fuel in 2016 and 2017. Based on the service relationship with our customers, either we or our customers claim the credit. AFTC revenue for the 2017 calendar year will be recognized and collected in 2018. AFTC is not available, and may not be reinstated, for vehicle fuel sales after December 31, 2017. 
Station Construction and Engineering.    We design and construct fueling stations and facility modifications and sell or lease some of these stations to our customers. We charge construction or other fees or lease rates based on the size and complexity of the project. Since 2008, we have served as the general contractor or supervised qualified third-party contractors to build 436 natural gas fueling stations. We acquired the additional stations that we own but did not build through acquisitions of assets or businesses. We use a combination of custom designed and off-the-shelf equipment to build fueling stations. Equipment for a CNG station typically consists of dryers, compressors, dispensers and storage tanks. Equipment for a LNG station typically consists of storage tanks and dispensing equipment. Many of our fueling stations have separate public access areas for retail customers, which generally have the look, feel and dispensing rates of gasoline and diesel fueling stations. We also offer assessment, design and modification solutions to provide operators with code-compliant service and maintenance facilities for natural gas vehicle fleets. For example, our NGV Easy Bay product is a natural gas vapor leak barrier developed specifically for natural gas vehicle facilities.
RNG Sales.    RNG is produced from waste streams such as landfills, animal waste digesters and wastewater treatment plants. RNG production plants are connected to natural gas pipelines, which allow RNG to be transported to vehicle fueling stations where it can be compressed and dispensed as CNG, and to LNG liquefaction facilities where it is converted to LNG. We purchase RNG from third -party producers, and we sell that RNG for vehicle fuel use through our fueling infrastructure under the brand name Redeem.    
Sales of RINs and LCFS Credits.   We generate RIN Credits when we sell RNG for use as a vehicle fuel in the United States, and we generate LCFS Credits when we sell RNG and conventional natural gas for use as a vehicle fuel in California and Oregon. We can sell these credits to third parties who need the RINs and LCFS Credits to comply with federal and state emission compliance requirements. Generally, the amount of RINs and LCFS Credits we generate increases as we sell higher volumes of natural gas as a vehicle fuel, but the amount of credits we sell and our revenue from these sales can vary depending on a number of factors, including the market for these credits, which has historically been volatile and subject to significant price fluctuations, any changes to the federal and state programs under which the credits are generated and sold, and our ability to strictly comply with these programs.
Vehicle Acquisition and Finance.    We offer vehicle finance services, including loans and leases, to help our customers acquire natural gas vehicles. As appropriate, we apply for and receive federal, state and local incentives associated with natural gas vehicle purchases and pass these benefits through to our customers. We may also secure vehicles to place with customers and/or pay deposits with respect to these vehicles before receiving a firm order from our customers, which we may be required to purchase if our customers fail to purchase the vehicle as anticipated.
In July 2017, we agreed to purchase 146 used natural gas heavy -duty trucks at a favorable price from a single seller, with the intention of selling the trucks to our customers.
6

Grant Programs.    We apply for and help our fleet customers apply for federal, state and local grant programs in areas in which we operate. These programs can provide funding for natural gas vehicle conversions and purchases, natural gas fueling station construction and natural gas vehicle fuel sales.
Former Activities.    Before March 31, 2017, we produced at our own production plants a portion of the RNG that we sold. On March 31, 2017, we completed the sale to BP Products North America, Inc. (“BP”) of certain assets related to this RNG production business, including two RNG production facilities, a 50% ownership interest in joint ventures formed to develop two new RNG production facilities, and third-party RNG supply contracts (we refer to this asset sale transaction as the “BP Transaction”). After the BP Transaction, we obtain all of the RNG we sell from third-party producers, including BP.
Before December 29, 2017, we, through our former subsidiary IMW Industries Ltd. (formerly known as Clean Energy Compression Corp.) (“CEC”), manufactured natural gas fueling compressors and other equipment used in CNG stations. On December 29, 2017, we completed the combination of CEC with SAFE S.p.A, the natural gas fueling compressor subsidiary of Landi Renzo S.p.A. (“LR”), in a new company known as “SAFE&CEC S.r.l.” (we refer to this combination transaction as the “CEC Combination”). SAFE&CEC S.r.l. is focused on manufacturing, selling and servicing natural gas fueling compressors and related equipment for the global natural gas fueling market. We and LR own 49% and 51%, respectively, of SAFE&CEC S.r.l.
Customer Markets 
We serve customers in a variety of markets, including trucking, airports, refuse, public transit, industrial and institutional energy users and government fleets. We believe these customer markets are well-suited for the adoption of natural gas vehicle fuel because they consume relatively high volumes of fuel, refuel at centralized locations or along well-defined routes and/or are facing increasingly stringent emissions or other environmental requirements.
Trucking. We believe heavy-duty trucking represents one of the greatest opportunities for natural gas to be used as a vehicle fuel in the United States, and as of December 31, 2017, fuel over 3,000 heavy-duty trucks. Because these high-mileage vehicles consume substantial amounts of fuel, they can derive significant benefits from the lower cost of natural gas. Many well-known shippers, manufacturers, retailers and other truck fleet operators have started to adopt natural gas fueled trucks to move their freight. Such companies include Honda, Frito-Lay, FedEx, Anheuser-Busch, Verizon, Bimbo, The Home Depot, AT&T, Colgate-Palmolive, Costco Wholesale, Lowes, Pepsi, UPS, MillerCoors, HP, Unilever, Starbucks, Kraft, Kroger, P&G, Hertz and Owens Corning. 
To help facilitate the transition of trucking fleets to natural gas, we have negotiated favorable CNG and LNG tank pricing from manufacturers, which we are passing along to our customers, and we've built America's Natural Gas Highway. Many existing ANGH stations are located at Pilot Flying J Travel Centers, one of the largest truck fueling operators in the United States. Building ANGH has required a significant use of capital and other resources.
Airports. We estimate that vehicles serving airports in the United States, including airport delivery fleets, rental car and parking passenger shuttles and taxis, consume an aggregate of approximately two billion gallons of fuel per year. Additionally, many U.S. airports face emissions challenges and are under regulatory directives and political pressure to reduce pollution, particularly as part of any expansion plans. As a result, many of these airports have adopted various strategies to address tailpipe emissions, including rental car and hotel shuttle consolidation and requiring or encouraging service vehicle operators to switch their fleets to natural gas. To assist in this effort, airports are contracting with service providers to design, build and operate natural gas fueling stations in strategic locations on their properties.
As of December 31, 2017, we serve customers at 39 airports, including Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International, Baltimore Washington International, Dallas-Ft. Worth International, Denver International, Dulles International (Washington D.C.), George Bush International (Houston), Las Vegas, Logan International (Boston), LaGuardia (New York City), John F. Kennedy International (New York City), Los Angeles International, Newark International, Oakland International, Orlando, Phoenix Sky Harbor International, San Francisco International, San Diego International, SeaTac International (Seattle) and Tampa International.
Refuse. According to INFORM, there are nearly 200,000 refuse trucks in the United States that collect and haul refuse and recyclables, which collectively consume approximately two billion gallons of fuel per year. We estimate that approximately 55% of new refuse trucks in 2017 operate on natural gas, up from approximately 3% of new refuse trucks in 2008. Refuse haulers are increasingly adopting trucks that run on CNG to realize operating savings and to address their customers' demands for reduced emissions. 
As of December 31, 2017, we fuel over 11,000 refuse vehicles for customers including Waste Management and Republic Services, as well as other waste haulers such as Atlas Disposal, Burrtec, Recology, South San Francisco Scavenger, Waste Connections and Waste Pro, among others. We also provide vehicle fueling services to municipal refuse fleets, including fleets in Dallas, Los Angeles, San Antonio and New York City, among other locations. 
7

Public Transit. According to the American Public Transportation Association, there are over 71,000 municipal transit buses operating in the United States. In many areas increasingly stringent emissions standards have limited the fueling options available to public transit operators. Also, transit agencies typically fuel at a central location and use high volumes of fuel. We estimate that transit agencies in the United States consume approximately 1.5 billion gallons of fuel per year. Many transit agencies have been early adopters of natural gas vehicles, and over 25% of existing transit buses and over 35% of new transit buses operate on natural gas. 
As of December 31, 2017, we fuel close to 9,000 transit vehicles for customers including Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority, Foothill Transit (Los Angeles County, California), Orange County Transit Authority, Santa Monica Big Blue Bus, Dallas Area Rapid Transit Phoenix Transit, New Jersey Transit, Jacksonville Transportation Authority, NICE Bus (Nassau County, New York) and Washington Metro Area Transportation Authority, as well as public transit customers in British Columbia.
Industrial and Institutional Customers. NG Advantage uses its virtual natural gas pipelines and interconnects to serve a number of customers that do not have direct access to natural gas pipelines or desire to take advantage of commodity price differences. We also transport LNG to customers via virtual natural gas pipelines.
Government Fleets. In 2015, 2016 and 2017, approximately 18%, 16% and 19% of our revenue, respectively, was derived from contracts with government entities, such as municipal transit fleets. As government regulations on pollution continue to become more stringent, government agencies are evaluating ways to make their fleets cleaner and run more economically. 
Our representative government fleet customers include the California Department of Transportation, State of New York, State of Colorado, City of New York, City of Denver, City and County of Los Angeles, City of Newport Beach, South Coast Air Quality Management District (Southern California region), City and County of San Francisco, City of Oakland, City and County of Dallas, City of Phoenix, The University of California, and Oklahoma State University.
Competition
The market for vehicle fuels is highly competitive. We believe the biggest competition for CNG and LNG use as a vehicle fuel is gasoline and diesel, as the vast majority of vehicles in our markets are powered by these fuels. We also compete with suppliers of other alternative vehicle fuels, including renewable diesel, biodiesel and ethanol, as well as producers and fuelers of alternative vehicles, including hybrid, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Additionally, our stations compete directly with other natural gas fueling stations and indirectly with electric vehicle charging stations and fueling stations for other alternative vehicle fuels. 
A significant number of established businesses, including alternative vehicle and alternative fuel companies, refuse collectors, utilities and their affiliates, industrial gas companies, truck stop and fuel station owners, fuel providers and other organizations have entered or may enter the market for natural gas and other alternatives for use as vehicle fuel. We believe we have approximately 75 competitors in the market for natural gas vehicle fuels, including:

• | Providers of CNG fuel infrastructure and fueling services, including Love's Trillium, Gain Clean Fuels, TruStar Energy, AmpCNG and EVO CNG;


• | Fuel station owners, such as Kwik Trip, a company that owns CNG fueling stations in the Midwestern United States;


• | Shell Oil Products U.S., which operates LNG fueling stations;


• | Applied LNG Technology, Stabilis and Prometheus Energy, each of which distributes LNG; and


• | Utilities and their affiliates in several states, including California, Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Utah and Washington, which own and operate public access CNG stations that compete with our stations.

We also face high levels of competition with respect to our other business activities. For instance, we compete with many third parties for the rights to procure RNG from producers and for customers to purchase the RNG that we sell. In addition, we transport and sell CNG through NG Advantage’s virtual natural gas pipelines and interconnects and compete with other participants in this market, including Xpress Natural Gas, OsComp Systems and Irving Ltd.
We compete for vehicle fuel users based on demand for the type of fuel, which may be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, cost, supply, availability, quality, cleanliness and safety of the fuel; cost and availability of vehicles; convenience and accessibility of fueling stations; and recognition of the brand. We believe we compare favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors; however, many of our competitors have longer operating histories, more experience, larger customer bases, more expansive brand recognition, deeper market penetration and substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer preferences, legal requirements or other industry or regulatory trends, devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their 
8

products, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, dedicate more effort to infrastructure and systems development in support of their business or product development activities and exert more influence on the regulatory landscape that impacts the vehicle fuels market. Additionally, utilities and their affiliates typically have additional and unique competitive advantages, including a lower cost of capital, substantial and predictable cash flows, long-standing customer relationships, greater brand awareness and large and well-trained sales and marketing organizations.
We expect competition to increase in the vehicle fuels markets generally and, if the demand for natural gas vehicle fuel increases, in the market for natural gas vehicle fuel.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, building codes and construction, zoning and land use, the government procurement process, any political activities or lobbying in which we may engage, public reporting and taxation, among others. Any changes to existing laws or regulations, adoption of new laws or regulations or failure by us to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in significant additional expense to us or our customers or a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Regulations that significantly affect our various operating activities are described below. Compliance with these regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position to date, but new laws or regulations or amendments to existing laws or regulations to make them more stringent could have such an effect in the future. We cannot estimate the costs that may be required for us to comply with potential new laws or changes to existing laws, and these unknown costs are not contemplated by our existing customer agreements or our budgets and cost estimates.
Construction and Operation of CNG and LNG Stations. To construct a CNG or LNG fueling station, we must satisfy permitting and other requirements and either we or a third -party contractor must be licensed as a general engineering contractor. Each CNG and LNG fueling station must be constructed in accordance with federal, state and local regulations pertaining to station design, environmental health, accidental release prevention, above-ground storage tanks and hazardous waste and other materials. For fueling stations we operate, we are also required to register with certain state agencies as a retailer/wholesaler of CNG and LNG. We also may benefit from any grant programs or similar government incentives that may be available for the construction of natural gas fueling stations.
Transfer of LNG. Federal safety standards require each transfer of LNG to be conducted in accordance with specific written safety procedures. These procedures must require that qualified personnel be in attendance during all LNG transfer operations, and these procedures must be implemented, and copies of the procedures must be available/displayed, at each LNG transfer location. 
Construction and Operation of LNG Liquefaction Plants. To build and operate LNG liquefaction plants, we must apply for facility permits or licenses that address many factors, including storm water and wastewater discharges, waste handling and air emissions related to production activities and equipment operation. The construction of LNG plants must also be approved by local planning boards and fire departments.
Vehicle Finance. State agencies generally require the registration of finance lenders. For example, in California, pursuant to the California Finance Lenders Law, one of our subsidiaries is required to be registered as a finance lender with the California Department of Corporations.
Generation and Sale of RIN Credits and LCFS Credits. In February 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") finalized the RFS (which was established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992/2005), which creates RINs that can be generated by the production and use of RNG in the transportation sector and sold to fuel providers that are not compliant under the RFS. In addition, CARB has adopted the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which encourages low carbon "compliant" transportation fuels (including CNG, LNG and RNG) in the California marketplace by allowing producers of these fuels to generate LCFS Credits that can be sold to noncompliant regulated parties.
Sale of Natural Gas Vehicle Fuel: AFTC. We have been eligible to receive the AFTC alternative fuels tax credit for our natural gas vehicle fuel sales made between October 1, 2006 and December 31, 2017. On February 9, 2018, AFTC was retroactively extended from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, and AFTC revenue for the 2017 calendar year will be recognized and collected in 2018. AFTC is not available, and may not be reinstated, for vehicle fuel sales after December 31, 2017. See the additional discussion regarding AFTC under “Our Products, Services and Other Business Activities” above.
Sale of Natural Gas Vehicle Fuel, Operation of Fueling Stations and Production of LNG: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Regulation. California has enacted laws and regulations that require specified greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and the federal government and many other state governments are considering similar measures. These regulations, if and when adopted and 
9

implemented, could impact several areas of our operations, including regulating the greenhouse gas emissions produced by or associated with the CNG, LNG and RNG we sell, our CNG and LNG fueling stations and our LNG production plants.
California’s greenhouse gas emissions laws require statewide reductions of greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. As of January 1, 2015, California's AB 32 law began regulating the greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels, including the emissions associated with the CNG and LNG vehicle fuel that we sell in the state.
Under AB 32, the regulated party with respect to CNG vehicle fuel use is the utility that owns the pipe through which the fossil fuel natural gas is sold.  We anticipate that, over time, as the utilities' costs increase to comply with this law, we or, to the extent we pass these costs through to our customers, our CNG customers will be required to pay more for CNG vehicle fuel to cover the increased AB 32 compliance costs of the utility. The amount of these costs that we or our CNG customers will be required to pay will be determined by the amount a utility spends to buy any carbon credits needed to comply with AB 32 and the amount of natural gas we or our customers buy through the utility’s pipeline. With respect to LNG vehicle fuel use, the LNG vehicle fuel provider is the regulated party under AB 32. As a result, we will incur increased costs to comply with AB 32, and the amount of the increase will be based on how much LNG vehicle fuel we sell that is regulated, CARB's requirements relating to the regulation of LNG vehicle fuel, any applicable regulatory changes and the cost of any carbon credits we purchase to comply with AB 32. We will try to pass the costs we incur to comply with this law through to our LNG customers. Although our Redeem RNG vehicle fuel may qualify for an exemption from AB 32 when sold as CNG or LNG, the availability of any such exemption is uncertain at this time due to the complexity of the requirements that must be met in order to qualify for an exemption and the possibility of changes to the law. Any Redeem volumes that are not exempt would incur compliance costs commensurate with sales of CNG and LNG derived from fossil fuel natural gas.
Sales and Marketing
We market our brands, products and services primarily through our direct sales force, which includes sales representatives covering all of our major geographic and customer markets, as well as attendance at trade shows and participation in industry conferences and events. Our sales and marketing team also works closely with federal, state and local government agencies to provide education about the value of natural gas as a vehicle fuel and to keep abreast of proposed and newly adopted regulations that affect our industry.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 431 people. We have not experienced any work stoppages and none of our employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good.
