 ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
  
  History
  
 We were originally incorporated in September 2000 as Rocker & Spike Entertainment, Inc. In January 2001 we changed our name to Reconstruction Data Group, Inc., and in April 2003 we changed our name to Verdisys, Inc. and were engaged in the business of providing satellite services to agribusiness. In June 2005, we changed our name to Blast Energy Services, Inc. (“Blast”) to reflect our new focus on the energy services business, and in 2010 we changed the direction of the Company to focus on the acquisition of oil and gas producing properties.
  
 On July 27, 2012, we acquired through a reverse acquisition, Pacific Energy Development Corp., a privately held Nevada corporation, which we refer to as Pacific Energy Development. As described below, pursuant to the acquisition, the shareholders of Pacific Energy Development gained control of approximately 95% of the voting securities of our company. Since the transaction resulted in a change of control, Pacific Energy Development was the acquirer for accounting purposes. In connection with the merger, which we refer to as the Pacific Energy Development merger, Pacific Energy Development became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we changed our name from Blast Energy Services, Inc. to PEDEVCO Corp. Following the merger, we refocused our business plan on the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas resources in the United States, with a primary focus on oil and natural gas shale plays and a secondary focus on conventional oil and natural gas plays.
  
  Business Operations
  
  Overview
  
 We are an energy company engaged primarily in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas shale plays in the Denver-Julesberg Basin (“D-J Basin”) in Colorado, which contains hydrocarbon bearing deposits in several formations, including the Niobrara, Codell, Greenhorn, Shannon, J-Sand, and D-Sand. As of December 31, 2017, we held approximately 10,961 net D-J Basin acres located in Weld County, Colorado through our wholly-owned subsidiary Red Hawk Petroleum, LLC (“Red Hawk”), which acreage is located in the Wattenberg and Wattenberg Extension areas of the D-J Basin, which we refer to as our “D-J Basin Asset.” As of December 31, 2017, we held interests in 61 gross (17.4 net) wells in our D-J Basin Asset, of which 14 gross (12.5 net) wells are operated by Red Hawk and are currently producing, 25 gross (4.9 net) wells are non-operated, and 22 wells have an after-payout interest. During the quarter-ended December 31, 2017, the Company produced an average of approximately 189 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (“BOEPD”) from its D-J Basin Asset.
  
 We have listed below the total production volumes and total revenue net to the Company for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 attributable to our D-J Basin Asset that would be net to our interest if reported on a consolidated basis, including the calculated production volumes and revenue numbers for our D-J Basin Asset held indirectly through Condor Energy Technology LLC (“Condor”), an entity we had a 20% interest in which we divested in February 2015.

  Business Strategy
  
 We believe that the D-J Basin shale play represents among the most promising unconventional oil and natural gas plays in the U.S. We plan to opportunistically seek additional acreage proximate to our currently held core acreage located in the Wattenberg and Wattenberg Extension areas of Weld County, Colorado. Our strategy is to be the operator, directly or through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, in the majority of our acreage so we can dictate the pace of development in order to execute our business plan. The majority of our capital expenditure budget for the next twenty four months will be focused on the development of our D-J Basin Asset. Our development plan calls for the development of approximately $8.37 million in capital expenditures in order to drill and complete, participate in the drilling and completion of, and/or acquire approximately 2.1 net wells in our D-J Basin Asset in 2018 (with an additional 6.4 net wells to be drilled and completed in 2019 for a combined total 2018-2019 drilling capital budget of $34.85 million). We expect our projected cash flow from operations combined with our existing cash on hand, up to $2.0 million of gross proceeds available from the issuance of our common shares through National Securities Corporation under our current “at the market offering” (of which $1.359 million remains available for issuance, subject to limitation under the SEC’s “Baby Shelf Rules”), and approximately $18.0 million gross available under our current senior debt facility will be sufficient to fund our drilling plans and our operations through 2019, noting that the advancement of all or any portion of the approximately $18.0 million gross available under our current senior debt facility is in the sole and absolute discretion of the senior lenders and no senior lender is obligated to fund all or any part of the requested funding (See “Part I, Item 1. Business” — “Material 2016-2017 Transactions” — “Senior Debt Restructuring” and “Part I” – “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, including “Our Tranche A Notes and Tranche B Notes include various covenants, reduces our flexibility, increases our interest expense and may adversely impact our operations and our costs.”). In addition, we may seek additional funding through asset sales, farm-out arrangements, lines of credit, or public or private debt or equity financings to fund additional 2018-2019 capital expenditures and/or repay or refinance a portion or all of our outstanding debt. If market conditions are not conducive to raising additional funds, the Company may choose to extend the drilling program and associated capital expenditures further into 2020. The availability of additional borrowings under the senior debt facility is subject to the Company providing matching funds for all amounts borrowed, which additional borrowed funds may only be used to fund development costs.
  
 During 2017, the Company focused primarily on maintaining oil and gas production levels, keeping operational costs down, and seeking to restructure and/or satisfy its senior debt through a variety of means, including, but not limited to, pursuing potential equity investments, debt restructuring transactions, and business combinations. The Company continues to pursue such transactions, although there can be no guarantee that the Company will be successful in its efforts to restructure and/or satisfy its senior debt. See “Risk Factors” below.
  
 Management is continually reviewing the recoverability of its oil and gas assets given the reduction of crude oil and natural gas prices during the year. Over the course of the year, we have identified acreage that we believe has a low probability of development in the near future and have not renewed such leases where appropriate and impaired the values as necessary. We believe that a significant portion of the effects of lower crude oil prices are now being offset by the continuing reduction of drilling and completion, collection, selling and LOE costs. We believe the leases we currently plan to develop in our 2018-2019 development plan continue to be economic due to our estimates of total recoverable reserves, expected production rates and the continued reduction in development and operational costs through this year. The recoverability of our oil and gas assets is dependent on our ability to secure sufficient funds to develop our properties. If we are unable to have access to our credit facilities or alternative financing transactions, and crude oil prices stay at their current prices or go lower or if the new development and operational costs do not hold or such costs return to higher levels, Company management may deem it appropriate in the future to impair certain of our oil and gas properties in the event we determine we will not be able to fully develop our drilling program.

  Competition
  
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We compete and will continue to compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for exploration opportunities, acreage and property acquisitions. We also compete for drilling rig contracts and other equipment and labor required to drill, operate and develop our properties. Most of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, staffs, facilities and other resources than we have. In addition, larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. These competitors may be able to pay more for drilling rigs or exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can. Our competitors may also be able to afford to purchase and operate their own drilling rigs.
  
 Our ability to drill and explore for oil and natural gas and to acquire properties will depend upon our ability to conduct operations, to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment. Many of our competitors have a longer history of operations than we have, and most of them have also demonstrated the ability to operate through industry cycles.
  
  Competitive Strengths
  
 We believe we are well positioned to successfully execute our business strategies and achieve our business objectives because of the following competitive strengths:
  
 Management. We have assembled a management team at our Company with extensive experience in the fields of international business development, petroleum engineering, geology, petroleum field development and production, petroleum operations and finance. Several members of the team developed and ran successful energy ventures that were commercialized at Texaco, Erin Energy Corp. and other international and domestic energy companies. We believe that our management team is highly qualified to identify, acquire and exploit energy resources in the U.S.
  
 Our management team is headed by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael L. Peterson, who brings extensive experience in the energy, corporate finance and securities sectors, including as a Vice President of Goldman Sachs & Co., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Nevo Energy, Inc. (formerly Solargen Energy, Inc.), and a former director of Aemetis, Inc. (formerly AE Biofuels Inc.). In addition, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Clark R. Moore, has over 10 years of energy industry experience, and formerly served as acting general counsel of Erin Energy Corp.
  
 Our board of directors also brings extensive oil and gas industry experience, headed by our Chairman Frank C. Ingriselli, an international oil and gas industry veteran with nearly 40 years of experience in the energy industry, including as the President of Texaco International Operations Inc., President and Chief Executive Officer of Timan Pechora Company, President of Texaco Technology Ventures, and President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and founder of Erin Energy Corp. Also on our Board sits Ms. Elizabeth P. Smith, who served in numerous executive-level capacities at Texaco, including as Corporate Compliance Officer, Director of Investor Relations, Vice President of Corporate Communications, and Vice President of Texaco Inc. with responsibility and oversight of Texaco’s Shareholder Services Group, and Adam McAfee, a Certified Management Accountant and “audit committee financial expert” with over 30 years’ experience, with prior positions at Nevo Energy, Inc., Aemetis, Inc., Apple Computer and others.
  
 Key Advisors. Our key advisors include Tenet Advisory Group, LLC, which we refer to as TAG, and other industry veterans. The TAG team replaced South Texas Reservoir Alliance (“STXRA”) as our contract operator with respect to our D-J Basin operations in January 2017, pursuant to a customary written engagement providing for hourly billing for work performed by TAG for us, and terminable upon 60 days prior notice by either party. TAG has experience in drilling and completing horizontal wells, including over 150 horizontal wells with lengths exceeding 4,000 feet from 2010 to 2017, as well as experience in both slick water and hybrid multi-stage hydraulic fracturing technologies and in the operation of shale wells and fields. The TAG team has over 130 years of combined technical oil and gas experience covering reservoir engineering, geology, geophysics, drilling, completion, production operations, land and marketing across multiple producing regions and basins including East Texas, Onshore and Offshore Gulf Coast, Permian Basin, Mid-Continent and the Rockies. We believe that our relationship with TAG will supplement the core competencies of our management team and provide us with petroleum and reservoir engineering, petrophysical, and operational competencies that will help us to evaluate, acquire, develop, and operate petroleum resources into the future.

 Significant acreage positions and drilling potential. We have accumulated interests in a total of approximately 10,961 net acres in our core D-J Basin Asset operating area, which we believe represents a significant unconventional resource play. The majority of our interests are in or near areas of considerable activity by both major and independent operators, although such activity may not be indicative of our future operations. Based on our current acreage position, we believe our current D-J Basin Asset could contain up to approximately 137 potential net wells based on 80 acre spacing, providing us with a substantial drilling inventory for future years. 
  
  Marketing
  
 The prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production fluctuate widely. The past years’ collapse in oil prices was among the most severe on record. The daily NYMEX WTI oil spot price went from a high of $107.95 per Bbl in June 2014 to low of $26.19 per Bbl in February 2016, the lowest settlement in over a decade and rebounding up 100% from its February 2016 low but still approximately 50% off its June 2014 high. The drop and volatility in crude oil pricing is due in large part to increased production levels, crude oil inventories and recessed global economic growth. Oil prices are also impacted by real or perceived geopolitical risks in oil producing regions, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, weather and the global economy. We expect, and have already begun to see, that depressed oil prices will lead to cuts in the exploration and production budgets to reduce incremental oil supply, which should ultimately restore equilibrium to the world oil market and rebalance oil prices. Decreases in these commodity prices adversely affect the carrying value of our proved reserves and our revenues, profitability and cash flows. Short-term disruptions of our oil and natural gas production occur from time to time due to downstream pipeline system failure, capacity issues and scheduled maintenance, as well as maintenance and repairs involving our own well operations. These situations can curtail our production capabilities and ability to maintain a steady source of revenue for our company. In addition, demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal in nature, with peak demand and typically higher prices during the colder winter months. See “Risk Factors” below.
  
 Oil. Our crude oil is generally sold under short-term, extendable and cancellable agreements with unaffiliated purchasers. As a consequence, the prices we receive for crude oil move up and down in direct correlation with the oil market as it reacts to supply and demand factors. Transportation costs related to moving crude oil are also deducted from the price received for crude oil.
  
 We are a party to a 12-month crude oil purchase contract with a third party buyer, expiring December 31, 2018, pursuant to which the buyer purchases the crude oil produced from our 14 operated wells in our D-J Basin Asset, at a price per barrel equal to the average of the New York Mercantile Exchange’s ("NYMEX") daily settle quoted price for Cushing/WTI for trade days only during a calendar month, applicable to product delivered during any such calendar month, less a per barrel differential of $3.15. The crude oil is purchased at the wellhead, and we do not bear any incremental transportation costs.
  
 Natural Gas. Our natural gas is sold under both long-term and short-term natural gas purchase agreements. Natural gas produced by us is sold at various delivery points at or near producing wells to both unaffiliated independent marketing companies and unaffiliated mid-stream companies. We receive proceeds from prices that are based on various pipeline indices less any associated fees for processing, location or transportation differentials.
  
 In connection with our March 2014 acquisition of certain D-J Basin assets from Continental Resources, Inc. (which we refer to as the “Continental Acquisition”), we became a party to a Gas Purchase Contract, dated December 1, 2011, with DCP Midstream, LP (which we refer to as “DCP”), pursuant to which we have agreed to sell, and DCP has agreed to purchase, all gas produced from six (6) of our D-J Basin Asset operated wells and surrounding lands located in Weld County, Colorado, at a purchase price equal to 83% of the net weighted average value for gas attributable to us that is received by DCP at its facilities sold during the month, less a $0.06/gallon local fractionation fee, for a period of ten years, terminating December 1, 2021.

 In connection with our Continental Acquisition in March 2014, we also became a party to a Gas Purchase Agreement, dated April 1, 2012, as amended, with Sterling Energy Investments LLC, which we refer to as Sterling, pursuant to which we have agreed to sell, and Sterling has agreed to purchase, all gas produced from eight (8) of our D-J Basin Asset wells and surrounding lands located in Weld County, Colorado, at a purchase price equal to 85% of the revenue received by Sterling from the sale of gas after processing at Sterling’s plant that is attributable to us during the month, less a $0.50/Mcf gathering fee, subject to escalation, for a period of twenty years, terminating April 1, 2032.
  
 We endeavor to ensure that title to our properties is in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry. Some of our acreage may be obtained through farmout agreements, term assignments and other contractual arrangements with third parties, the terms of which often will require the drilling of wells or the undertaking of other exploratory or development activities in order to retain our interests in the acreage. Our title to these contractual interests will be contingent upon our satisfactory fulfillment of these obligations. Our properties are also subject to customary royalty interests, liens incident to financing arrangements, operating agreements, taxes and other burdens that we believe will not materially interfere with the use and operation of or affect the value of these properties. We intend to maintain our leasehold interests by making lease rental payments or by producing wells in paying quantities prior to expiration of various time periods to avoid lease termination.
  
  Oil and Gas Properties
  
 We believe that the D-J Basin shale play represents among the most promising unconventional oil and natural gas plays in the U.S. We plan to opportunistically seek additional acreage proximate to our currently held core acreage located in the Wattenberg and Wattenberg Extension areas of Weld County, Colorado. Our strategy is to be the operator, directly or through our subsidiaries and joint ventures, in the majority of our acreage so we can dictate the pace of development in order to execute our business plan. The majority of our capital expenditure budget for 2018 will be focused on the development of our D-J Basin Asset.
 
 Unless otherwise noted, the following table presents summary data for our leasehold acreage in our core D-J Basin Asset as of December 31, 2017 and our drilling capital budget with respect to this acreage from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019. If commodity prices do not increase significantly, we may delay drilling activities. The ultimate amount of capital we will expend may fluctuate materially based on, among other things, market conditions, commodity prices, asset monetizations, the success of our drilling results as the year progresses, and availability of capital (see “Part I” – “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.)
  
 
 | | | | Drilling Capital Budget January 1, 2018 - December 31, 2019
---------------------+-----------+--------------+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------
Current Core Assets: | Net Acres | Acre Spacing | Potential Net Wells (1) | Net Wells | Gross Costs per Well (2) | Capital Cost to the Company (2)
D-J Basin Asset | 10,961 | 80 | 137 | - | - | -

Total Assets | 10,961 | | 137 | 8.52 | | $34,852,000 


(1) | Potential Net Wells are calculated using 80 acre spacing, and not taking into account additional wells that could be drilled as a result of forced pooling in Niobrara, Colorado, where the D-J Basin Asset is located, which allows for forced pooling, and which may create more potential gross drilling locations than acre spacing alone would otherwise indicate.

  D-J Basin Asset
  
 We directly hold all of our interests in the D-J Basin Asset through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Red Hawk. These interests are all located in Weld County, Colorado. Red Hawk is currently the operator of 14 gross (12.5 net) wells located in our D-J Basin Asset. Our D-J Basin Asset acreage is located in the areas circled in the map below.

  Non-Core Assets
  
 We own 23,182,880 shares of common stock of Caspian Energy, a Canadian publicly-traded company, representing approximately 5% of its common stock. Caspian Energy holds the rights to explore and develop certain oil and gas properties in the Republic of Kazakhstan known as the North Block, a 1,470 square kilometer area located in the vicinity of the Kazakh pre-Caspian Basin. Our Chairman, Mr. Frank Ingriselli, also serves as Chairman of Caspian Energy. As partial consideration paid by the Company to Golden Globe Energy (US), LLC (“GGE”) to restructure certain junior Company debt held by GGE’s affiliates in May 2016, the Company provided GGE an option to acquire all of the Company’s interests in Caspian Energy for an option exercise price of $100,000, which expires May 12, 2019.
  
  Our Core Areas
  
 The majority of our capital expenditure budget for the period from January 2018 to December 2018 will be focused on the development of our core oil and natural gas properties located in the D-J Basin Asset. For additional information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
 D-J Basin Asset
  
 As of December 31, 2017 we held 10,961 net acres in oil and natural gas properties related to our D-J Basin Asset. We currently own direct interests in 61 gross (17.4 net) wells in our D-J Basin Asset, of which 14 gross (12.5 net) wells are operated by Red Hawk and are currently producing, 25 gross (4.9 net) wells are non-operated, and 22 wells have an after-payout interest. 
  
 Our development plan calls for the development of approximately $8.37 million in capital expenditures in order to drill and complete, participate in the drilling and completion of, and/or acquire approximately 2.1 net wells in our D-J Basin Asset in 2018 (with an additional 6.4 net wells to be drilled and completed in 2019 for a combined total 2018-2019 drilling capital budget of $34.85 million). We expect our projected cash flow from operations combined with our existing cash on hand, up to $2.0 million of gross proceeds available from the issuance of our common shares through National Securities Corporation under our current “at the market offering,” and approximately $18.0 million gross available under our current senior debt facility, will be sufficient to fund our drilling plans and our operations through 2019 (see “Part I” – “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, including “Our Tranche A Notes and Tranche B Notes include various covenants, reduces our flexibility, increases our interest expense and may adversely impact our operations and our costs.”). In addition, we may seek additional funding through asset sales, farm-out arrangements, lines of credit, or public or private debt or equity financings to fund additional 2018-2019 capital expenditures and/or repay or refinance a portion or all of our outstanding debt. If market conditions are not conducive to raising additional funds, the Company may choose to extend the drilling program and associated capital expenditures further into 2020. The availability of additional borrowings under the senior debt facility is subject to the Company providing matching funds for all amounts borrowed, which additional borrowed funds may only be used to fund development costs.
  
 Based on publicly available information and information we have received from our oilfield service vendors, average drilling and completion costs for wells in our core area continue to be significantly below prices we have seen in 2015 and prior years. In addition to more favorable drilling and completion costs, average estimated ultimate recoveries, or EURs, and initial 30-day average production rates have continued to increase through improved completion techniques in the area. The drilling and completion costs incurred, EURs and initial production rates achieved by others may not be indicative of the well costs we will incur or the results we will achieve from our wells.
  
  Our Non-Core Assets
  
 As described above, we own 23,182,880 shares of common stock of Caspian Energy, a Canadian publicly-traded company, representing approximately 5% of its common stock. As partial consideration paid by the Company to GGE to restructure certain junior Company debt held by GGE’s affiliates in May 2016, the Company provided GGE an option to acquire all of the Company’s interests in Caspian Energy for an option exercise price of $100,000, which expires May 12, 2019, described in greater detail below under “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence” – “Agreements with Related Persons” – “Golden Globe Energy (US), LLC.”

  Material 2016-2017 Transactions
  
  Senior Debt Restructuring
  
 On May 12, 2016 (the “Closing Date”), the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Note Purchase Agreement (the “Amended NPA”), with SHIP, BRe BCLIC Sub, BRe WINIC 2013 LTC Primary, BRe WNIC 2013 LTC Sub, Heartland Bank (subsequently assigned to CadleRock IV, LLC, effective March 9, 2018), BHLN-Pedco Corp. (“BHLN”), BBLN-Pedco Corp. (“BBLN”), and RJC Credit LLC (“RJC”)(together with BHLN and BBLN, the “Tranche A Investors” and the “Lenders”), and BAM Administrative Services LLC, as agent for the Lenders (the “Agent”) (upon notice received from the Agent on October 10, 2017, the Agent resigned as agent for the Lenders effective December 31, 2017, and no replacement agent has been designated by the Lenders subsequent to such date). The Amended NPA amended and restated the March 2014 Senior Notes (as defined and discussed below under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” – “Liquidity and Capital Resources-Secured Debt Funding”), and the Company issued new Senior Secured Promissory Notes to each of the Lenders (collectively, the “Tranche B Notes”) in a transaction that qualified as a troubled debt restructuring. RJC is also a party to the RJC Junior Note (discussed below)(the “Senior Debt Restructuring”).
  
 The Amended NPA amended the Senior Notes as follows:
  
 
● | Created new “Tranche A Notes,” in substantially the same form and with similar terms as the Tranche B Notes, except as discussed below, consisting of a term loan issuable in tranches with a maximum aggregate principal amount of $25,960,000, with borrowed funds accruing interest at 15% per annum, and maturing on May 11, 2019 (the “Tranche A Maturity Date”) (the “Tranche A Notes,” and together with the Tranche B Notes, the “New Senior Notes”); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Company capitalized all accrued and unpaid interest under the Senior Notes, renaming them “Tranche B Notes,” as a term loan with an aggregate outstanding principal balance as of May 12, 2016 equal to $39,065,000. The Tranche B Notes mature on June 11, 2019 except for the Tranche B Note issued to RJC which matures on July 11, 2019; 
● | Amended the provisions of the Senior Notes which required mandatory prepayments from our revenues, replacing them with a Net Revenue Sweep as described below; and 
● | Provides that interest on the Tranche B Notes will continue to accrue at the rate of 15% per annum, but all accrued interest through December 31, 2017 shall be deferred until due and payable on the maturity date, with all interest amounts deferred being added to the principal of the Tranche B Notes on a monthly basis and that following December 31, 2017, all interest will accrue and be paid monthly in arrears in cash to the Tranche B Note holders, provided, however, no payment may be made on the Tranche B Notes unless and until the Tranche A Notes are repaid in full.


 
 The Tranche A Notes are substantially similar to the Tranche B Notes, except that such notes are senior to the Tranche B Notes, accrue interest until maturity and have priority to the payment of Monthly Net Revenues as discussed below.
  
 On the Closing Date, the Tranche A Investors loaned the Company their pro rata share of an aggregate of $6,422,000 (the “Initial Tranche A Funding”). The Initial Tranche A Funding net proceeds (also amounting to $6,422,000 less legal fees of $127,000) were used by the Company to (i) fund approximately $5.1 million due to a third party operator for drilling and completion expenses related to the acquired working interests in eight wells from Dome Energy, Inc. (“Dome Energy”), (ii) pay $750,000 of the Company’s past due payables to Liberty Oilfield Services, LLC (“Liberty”), (iii) pay $445,000 of unpaid interest payments due to Heartland Bank under its Tranche B Note through February 29, 2016, and (iv) pay fees and expenses of $127,000 incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Amended NPA and related documents.

 Subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended NPA, the Company may request each Tranche A Investor, from time to time, to advance to the Company additional amounts of funding (each, a “Subsequent Tranche A Funding”), provided that: (i) the Company may not request a Subsequent Tranche A Funding more than one time in any calendar month; (ii) Agent shall have received a written request from the Company at least 15 business days prior to the requested date of such advance (the “Advance Request”); (iii) no Event of Default or event that with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would become an Event of Default (a “Default”) shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom; and (iv) the Company shall provide to the Agent such documents, instruments, certificates and other writings as the Agent shall reasonably require in its sole and absolute discretion. The advancement of all or any portion of the Subsequent Tranche A Funding is in the sole and absolute discretion of the Agent and the Investors and no Investor is obligated to fund all or any part of the Subsequent Tranche A Funding. Each Subsequent Tranche A Funding is required to be in a minimum amount of $500,000 and multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof. The aggregate amount of Subsequent Tranche A Fundings that may be made by the Investors under the Amended NPA shall not exceed $18,577,876 and any Subsequent Tranche A Funding repaid may not be re-borrowed.
  
 In addition, subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended NPA, RJC agreed to loan to the Company $240,000, within 30 days of the Closing Date and within 30 days of each of July 1, 2016, October 1, 2016 and January 1, 2017 (collectively, the “RJC Fundings” and collectively with the Investor Tranche A Fundings, the “Fundings”), provided that no Event of Default or Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom. The aggregate amount of the RJC Fundings made by RJC under the Amended NPA shall not exceed $960,000 and any Funding repaid may not be re-borrowed.
  
 To guarantee RJC’s obligation in connection with the RJC Fundings as required under the Amended NPA, GGE entered into a Share Pledge Agreement with the Company, dated May 12, 2016 (the “GGE Pledge Agreement”), pursuant to which GGE agreed to pledge an aggregate of 10,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by GGE (convertible into 1,000,000 shares of Company common stock), which pledged shares are subject to automatic cancellation and forfeiture based on a schedule set forth in the GGE Share Pledge Agreement, in the event RJC fails to meet each of its RJC Funding obligations pursuant to the Amended NPA. To date, RJC has not met its RJC Funding obligations under the Amended NPA and the Company is entitled to cancel and forfeit 10,000 shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock held by GGE (convertible into 1,000,000 shares of Company common stock) pursuant to the terms of the GGE Pledge Agreement, which determination to cancel shares has not been made, and which shares have not been cancelled, as of the date of this filing.
  
 As additional consideration for the entry into the Amended NPA and transactions related thereto, the Company has granted to BHLN and BBLN, warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 596,280 shares of common stock of the Company (the “Investor Warrants”). The warrants have a 3 year term, are transferrable, and are exercisable on a cashless basis at any time at $2.50 per share. The Investor Warrants include a beneficial ownership limitation that prohibits the exercise of the Investor Warrants to the extent such exercise would result in the holder, together with its affiliates, holding more than 9.99% of the Company’s outstanding voting stock (the “Blocker Provision”). The fair value of the Investor Warrants issued is approximately $707,000 based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The relative fair value allocated to the Tranche A Notes and recorded as debt discount was $636,000.
  
 Other than the Investor Warrants, no additional warrants exercisable for common stock of the Company are due, owing, or shall be granted to the Lenders pursuant to the Senior Notes. In addition, warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 34,913 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $15.00 per share and warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 120,104 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $7.50 per share previously granted by the Company to certain of the Lenders on September 10, 2015, in connection with prior interest payment deferrals have been amended and restated to provide that all such warrants are exercisable on a cashless basis and include a Blocker Provision (the “Amended and Restated Warrants”).

 Additionally, the Company also agreed to (a) provide to the Agent and the Investors a monthly projected general and administrative expense report (the “Projected G&A”) and a monthly comparison report of the Projected G&A provided for the preceding month, with an explanation of any variances, provided that in no event shall such variances exceed $150,000, and (B) pay to the Agent within 2 business days following the end of each calendar month all of the Company’s oil and gas revenue received by the Company during such month (the “Net Revenue Sweep”), less (i) lease operating expenses, (ii) interest payments due to Investors under the New Senior Notes, (iii) general and administrative expenses not to exceed $150,000 per month unless preapproved by the Agent (the “G&A Cap”), and (iv) preapproved extraordinary expenses (together the “Monthly Net Revenues”). Amounts paid to the Agent through the Net Revenue Sweep are applied first to the repayment of principal and then interest due under the Tranche A Notes until such notes are paid in full and then to the repayment of principal and interest amounts due under the Tranche B Notes.
  
 The amounts outstanding under the New Senior Notes are secured by a first priority security interest in all of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ assets, property, real property, intellectual property, securities and proceeds therefrom, granted in favor of the Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, pursuant to a Security Agreement and a Patent Security Agreement, each entered into as of March 7, 2014, as amended on May 12, 2016 (the “Amended Security Agreement” and “Amended Patent Agreement,” respectively). Additionally, the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, was granted a mortgage and security interest in all of the Company’s and its subsidiaries real property as located in the State of Colorado and the State of Texas pursuant to (i) a Leasehold Deed of Trust, Fixture Filing, Assignment of Rents and Leases, and Security Agreements, dated March 7, 2014, as amended May 12, 2016, filed in Weld County and Morgan County, Colorado; and (ii) a Mortgage, Deed of Trust, Security Agreement, Financing Statement and Assignment of Production to be filed in Matagorda County, Texas (collectively, the “Amended Mortgages”).
  
 Additionally, the Company’s obligations under the New Senior Notes, Amended NPA and related agreements were guaranteed by the Company’s direct and indirect subsidiaries, Pacific Energy Development Corp., White Hawk Petroleum, LLC (“White Hawk”), Pacific Energy & Rare Earth Limited, Blackhawk Energy Limited, Pacific Energy Development MSL, LLC and Red Hawk Petroleum, LLC pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement, entered into on March 7, 2014, as amended on May 12, 2016 (the “Amended Guaranty Agreement”).
  
 Other than as described above, the terms of the Amended NPA (including the covenants and obligations thereunder) are substantially the same as the March 2014 Note Purchase Agreement, and the terms of the Tranche A Notes and Tranche B Notes (including the events of default, interest rates and conditions associated therewith) are substantially the same as the original March 2014 Notes.
  
  Junior Debt Restructuring
  
 On May 12, 2016, the Company entered into an Amendment No. 2 to Note and Security Agreement with RJC (the “Second Amendment”), pursuant to which the Company and RJC agreed to amend the RJC Junior Note (described and defined below under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” - “Liquidity and Capital Resources” - “Secured Debt Funding”), to (i) capitalize all accrued and unpaid interest under the RJC Junior Note as of the date of the parties’ entry into the Second Amendment, and add it to note principal, making the then current outstanding principal amount of the RJC Junior Note $9,379,000, (ii) extend the “Termination Date” thereunder (i.e., the maturity date) from December 31, 2017 to July 11, 2019, (iii) provide that all future interest accruing under the RJC Junior Note is deferred, due and payable on the Termination Date, with all future interest amounts deferred being added to principal on the first business day of the month following the month in which such deferred interest is accrued, and (iv) subordinate the RJC Junior Note to the New Senior Notes.
  
   
15


  
 
 As additional consideration for RJC’s agreement to enter into the Second Amendment, the Company entered into a Call Option Agreement with GGE, an affiliate of RJC, dated May 12, 2016 (the “GGE Option Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company provided GGE an option to purchase 23,182,880 common shares of Caspian Energy Inc., a British Columbia corporation, held by the Company, upon payment of $100,000 by GGE to the Company, which option expires on the “Termination Date” of the RJC Junior Note, as amended, as described above, currently May 12, 2019. The Company originally issued an option to GGE in February 2015 to acquire the Company’s interest in these shares in connection with the Company’s acquisition of certain producing oil and gas assets from GGE, which option expired unexercised in February 2016, as more fully described in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 24, 2015.
  
  GOM Holdings, LLC Merger Agreement
  
 On December 29, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “GOM Merger Agreement”) with White Hawk Energy, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and GOM Holdings, LLC (“GOM”). The GOM Merger Agreement provided for the Company’s acquisition of GOM through an exchange of certain of the shares of the Company’s common and preferred stock (the “Consideration Shares”), for 100% of the limited liability company membership units of GOM (the “GOM Units”), with the GOM Units being received by Merger Sub and GOM receiving the Consideration Shares (the “Merger”).
  
 On June 22, 2017, the Company terminated its then pending merger with GOM, in order to pursue an alternative transaction with a Hong Kong-based investor group as contemplated pursuant to a non-binding term sheet entered into by the Company and the investor group, which transaction was similarly terminated on September 29, 2017.
  
  Amendment to the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan
  
 At the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on December 28, 2017 (the “Annual Meeting”), the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) to increase by 1,500,000, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Plan to a total of 3,000,000 shares.
 Reverse Stock Split
  
 On March 27, 2017, pursuant to the authorization provided by the Company’s stockholders at the Company’s December 28, 2016 annual meeting, and in order to meet the continued listing standards of the NYSE American, the Board of Directors approved the filing of a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Formation with the Secretary of State of Texas to effect a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of all outstanding common stock shares of the Company, which was effective on April 7, 2017.
  
 The effect of the reverse stock split was to combine each 10 shares of outstanding common stock into one new share, with no change in authorized shares or par value per share. Proportional adjustments were also made to the conversion and exercise prices of the Company’s outstanding convertible preferred stock, warrants and stock options, and to the number of shares issued and issuable under the Company’s stock incentive plans.
  
 The effect of the reverse stock split has been retroactively affected throughout this report.

  Restricted Stock and Option Awards
  
 On December 28, 2017, the Company granted 150,000 shares of restricted Company common stock under the Amended and Restated 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) to each member of the Company’s Board of Directors – Messrs. Ingriselli, McAfee and Steinberg, and Ms. Smith – which shares vest on the date in 2018 that corresponds with each director’s original appointment date to the Company’s Board of Directors as a non-employee director, in each case subject to the recipient of the shares being a member of the Company’s Board of Directors on such vesting date, and subject to the terms and conditions of a Restricted Shares Grant Agreement entered into by and between the Company and the recipient. These shares were granted in accordance with the terms of the Company’s Board Compensation Program, as revised by the Board of Directors for the 2018 year to reduce the number of shares of restricted Company common stock issuable to each director to a fixed 150,000 shares rather than shares valued at $60,000 as of the date of grant, which would have otherwise exceeded 150,000 shares granted to each director.
  
 In addition, on December 28, 2017, in connection with the Company’s annual compensation review process, the Company granted restricted stock awards to Messrs. Michael L. Peterson (President and Chief Executive Officer) and Clark R. Moore (Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary), of 410,000 and 260,000 shares, respectively, and options to purchase 150,000 shares of common stock to Gregory Overholtzer (Chief Financial Officer), which options have an exercise price of $0.3088 per share and expire in five (5) years from the date of grant. The restricted stock and option awards were granted under the Plan, as amended. The restricted stock and option awards vest as follows: 50% of the shares/options on the six (6) month anniversary of December 28, 2017 (the “Grant Date”); (ii) 30% on the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Grant Date; and (iii) 20% on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Grant Date, in each case subject to the recipient of the shares or options being an employee of or consultant to the Company on such vesting date, and subject to the terms and conditions of a Restricted Shares Grant Agreement or Stock Option Agreement, as applicable, entered into by and between the Company and the recipient.
  
  Notice of Delisting of Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
  
 On December 27, 2016, the Company received notice from the NYSE American LLC (the “Exchange”) that the Company is not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the NYSE American Company Guide (“Company Guide”) since it reported stockholders’ equity of less than $6,000,000 at September 30, 2016 and has incurred net losses in its five most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2015.
  
 Receipt of the letter did not have any immediate effect upon the listing of the Company’s common stock, provided that in order to maintain its listing on the Exchange, the Exchange has requested that the Company submit a plan of compliance (the “Plan”) by January 27, 2017 addressing how the Company intends to regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the Company Guide by June 27, 2018.
  
 The Company’s management submitted a Plan to the Exchange by the January 27, 2017 deadline and the Exchange has accepted the Company’s Plan. As such, the Company will be able to continue its listing during the plan period and will be subject to continued periodic review by the Exchange staff. If the Company is unable to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by June 27, 2018, or the Company does not make progress consistent with the Plan during the plan period, the Company will be subject to delisting procedures as set forth in the Company Guide. The Company may then appeal such a determination by the staff of the Exchange in accordance with the provisions of the Company Guide. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve compliance with the Exchange’s continued listing standards within the required time frame. Until the Company regains compliance with the Exchange’s listing standards, a “.BC” indicator will be affixed to the Company’s trading symbol to denote non-compliance with the Exchange’s continued listing standards; provided that as disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on November 9, 2016, a “.BC” indicator is already affixed to the Company’s trading symbol due to the fact that the Company is not in compliance with Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company Guide.
  
   
17


  
 
 On May 3, 2017, the Company received notice from the Exchange that the Company was not in compliance with Sections 1003(a)(i) and (ii) (as well as Section (iii) as described above) of the Company Guide since it reported stockholders’ equity of less than $2,000,000 at December 31, 2016 and had incurred net losses in its five most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2016. No new or revised Plan was required to be submitted by the Exchange, and the Company believes it is making progress consistent with the Exchange-approved Plan.
  
  Shale Oil and Natural Gas Overview
  
 The surge of oil and natural gas production from underground shale rock formations has had a dramatic impact on the oil and natural gas market in the U.S., where the practice was first developed, and globally. Shale oil production is facilitated by the combination of a set of technologies that had been applied separately to other hydrocarbon reservoir types for many decades. In combination these technologies and techniques have enabled large volumes of oil to be produced from deposits with characteristics that would not otherwise permit oil to flow at rates sufficient to justify its exploitation. The application of horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing and advanced reservoir assessment tools to these reservoirs is unlocking a global resource of shale and other unconventional oil and natural gas that the International Energy Agency estimates could eventually double recoverable global oil reserves.
  
 Oil and natural gas produced from shale is considered an unconventional resource. Commercial oil and natural gas production from unconventional sources requires special techniques in order to achieve attractive oil and natural gas flow rates. Unlike conventional oil and natural gas, which is typically generated in deeper source rock and subsequently migrates into a sandstone structure with an overlying impermeable layer forming a “trap,” shale oil and natural gas is generated from organic material contained within the shale and retained by the rock’s inherent low permeability. Permeability is a measure of the ease with which natural gas, oil or other fluids can flow through the material. The same low permeability that secures large volumes of natural gas and liquids in place within the shale strata makes it much more difficult to extract them, even with a large pressure difference between the reservoir and the surface. The location and potential of many of today’s productive shale reservoirs were known for many years, but until the development of current shale oil and natural gas techniques these deposits were considered noncommercial or inaccessible.
  
 The main challenge of shale oil and natural gas drilling is to overcome the low permeability of the shale reservoirs. A conventional vertical oil or natural gas well drilled into one of these reservoirs might achieve production, though at reduced rates and for a limited duration before the oil or natural gas volume in proximity to the wellbore is exhausted. That often renders such an approach impractical and uneconomic for exploiting shale oil and natural gas. The two main technologies associated with U.S. shale oil and natural gas production are horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or “hydrofracking.” They are employed to overcome these constraints by greatly increasing the exposure of each well to the shale stratum and enabling oil and natural gas located farther from the well to flow through the rock and replace the nearby oil and natural gas that has been extracted to the surface.
  
 Instead of drilling a simple vertical well through the shale and then perforating the well within the zone where it is in contact with the shale, the drilling company drills a directional well vertically to within proximity of the shale and then executes a 90-degree turn in order to intersect the shale and then travel for a significant horizontal distance through it. A typical North American shale well has a horizontal extent of 1,000 feet to 8,000 feet or more.
  
 Once the lateral portion of the well has reached the desired extent, the other main technique of shale oil and natural gas drilling is deployed. After the well has been completed, the farthest section of the lateral is perforated, opening up holes through which fluid can flow. This portion of the reservoir is then hydrofracked by injecting fluid into the well under high pressure to fracture the exposed shale rock and open up pathways through which oil and natural gas can flow. The “fracking fluid” consists mainly of water with a variety of chemical additives intended to reduce friction and dissolve minerals, among other purposes, along with sand or sand-like material to prop open the new pathways created by hydrofracking. This process is then repeated at intervals along the well’s horizontal extent, successively perforating and hydrofracking each section in turn. This process creates a producing well that emulates the effect of a vertical well drilled into a conventional oil and natural gas reservoir by substituting multiple horizontal “pay zones” in the shale stratum for the thinner but more prolific vertical pay zone in a more permeable reservoir. Compared to conventional oil and natural gas drilling, the production of oil and natural gas from shale reservoirs thus entails more drilling, on average, and requires a substantial supply of water.

 Beginning in 2014, the oil and natural gas industry began to experience a sharp decline in commodity prices, with the daily NYMEX WTI oil spot price went from a high of $107.95 per Bbl in June 2014 to low of $26.19 per Bbl in February 2016, the lowest settlement in over a decade. This recent decline in oil prices has resulted in a slowing of the pace of U.S. shale oil production, with Baker Hughes’ rig count data showing a decrease in the number of oil rigs operating in the DJ-Niobrara from 42 rigs at the end of December 2014 to 26 rigs at the end of December 2017. However, this has also led to average drilling and completion costs for wells in the DJ-Niobrara significantly dropping from between $4.3 million (short-lateral) and $8.3 million (long lateral) per well in early 2015 to between $3.6 million and $4.3 million per well currently, which reduced costs partially offset the decline in commodity prices, resulting in new shale oil wells drilled in more thermally mature formations of the DJ-Niobrara expected to continue to yield positive economic returns.
  
  Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry
  
 Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Historically, our compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective. We do not believe that we would be affected by any such action materially differently than similarly situated competitors.
  
  Regulation Affecting Production
  
 The production of oil and natural gas is subject to United States federal and state laws and regulations, and orders of regulatory bodies under those laws and regulations, governing a wide variety of matters. All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area, and the unitization or pooling of oil or natural gas wells, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and gas we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, NGL and gas within its jurisdiction.
  
 States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and gas that may be produced from our wells, negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or limit the number of locations we can drill.
  
 The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of oil and natural gas production and related operations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
  
  Regulation Affecting Sales and Transportation of Commodities
  
 Sales prices of gas, oil, condensate and NGL are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. Although prices of these energy commodities are currently unregulated, the United States Congress historically has been active in their regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and gas, or the prices charged for these commodities might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by the United States Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations. Sales of oil and natural gas may be subject to certain state and federal reporting requirements.
  
   
19


  
 
 The price and terms of service of transportation of the commodities, including access to pipeline transportation capacity, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. Such regulation may affect the marketing of oil and natural gas produced by the Company, as well as the revenues received for sales of such production. Gathering systems may be subject to state ratable take and common purchaser statutes. Ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, oil and natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase, or accept for gathering, without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. These statutes may affect whether and to what extent gathering capacity is available for oil and natural gas production, if any, of the drilling program and the cost of such capacity. Further state laws and regulations govern rates and terms of access to intrastate pipeline systems, which may similarly affect market access and cost.
  
 The FERC regulates interstate natural gas pipeline transportation rates and service conditions. The FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting interstate transportation. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to ensure terms and conditions of interstate transportation service are not unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential, to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and to promote market transparency. We do not believe that our drilling program will be affected by any such FERC action in a manner materially differently than other similarly situated natural gas producers.
  
 In addition to the regulation of natural gas pipeline transportation, FERC has additional, jurisdiction over the purchase or sale of gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to FERC’s jurisdiction pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”). Under the EPAct 2005, it is unlawful for “any entity,” including producers such as us, that are otherwise not subject to FERC’s jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by FERC. FERC’s rules implementing this provision make it unlawful, in connection with the purchase or sale of gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. EPAct 2005 also gives FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 up to $1.2 million per day, per violation. The anti-manipulation rule applies to activities of otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which includes the annual reporting requirements under FERC Order No. 704 (defined below).
  
 In December 2007, FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (“Order No. 704”). Under Order No. 704, any market participant, including a producer that engages in certain wholesale sales or purchases of gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million MMBtus of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, must annually report such sales and purchases to FERC on Form No. 552 on May 1 of each year. Form No. 552 contains aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to the formation of price indices. Not all types of natural gas sales are required to be reported on Form No. 552. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order No. 704. Order No. 704 is intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale gas markets and to assist FERC in monitoring those markets and in detecting market manipulation.
  
 The FERC also regulates rates and terms and conditions of service on interstate transportation of liquids, including oil and NGL, under the Interstate Commerce Act, as it existed on October 1, 1977 (“ICA”). Prices received from the sale of liquids may be affected by the cost of transporting those products to market. The ICA requires that certain interstate liquids pipelines maintain a tariff on file with FERC. The tariff sets forth the established rates as well as the rules and regulations governing the service. The ICA requires, among other things, that rates and terms and conditions of service on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable.” Such pipelines must also provide jurisdictional service in a manner that is not unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential. Shippers have the power to challenge new and existing rates and terms and conditions of service before FERC.
 
   
20


  
 
 The rates charged by many interstate liquids pipelines are currently adjusted pursuant to an annual indexing methodology established and regulated by FERC, under which pipelines increase or decrease their rates in accordance with an index adjustment specified by FERC. For the five-year period beginning July 1, 2016, FERC established an annual index adjustment equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 1.23%. This adjustment is subject to review every five years. Under FERC’s regulations, a liquids pipeline can request a rate increase that exceeds the rate obtained through application of the indexing methodology by obtaining market-based rate authority (demonstrating the pipeline lacks market power), establishing rates by settlement with all existing shippers, or through a cost-of-service approach (if the pipeline establishes that a substantial divergence exists between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rates resulting from application of the indexing methodology). Increases in liquids transportation rates may result in lower revenue and cash flows for the Company.
  
 In addition, due to common carrier regulatory obligations of liquids pipelines, capacity must be prorated among shippers in an equitable manner in the event there are nominations in excess of capacity or for new shippers. Therefore, new shippers or increased volume by existing shippers may reduce the capacity available to us. Any prolonged interruption in the operation or curtailment of available capacity of the pipelines that we rely upon for liquids transportation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. However, we believe that access to liquids pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors.
  
 Rates for intrastate pipeline transportation of liquids are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate liquids pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate liquids pipeline rates, varies from state to state. We believe that the regulation of liquids pipeline transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is materially different from the effects on our similarly situated competitors.
  
 In addition to FERC’s regulations, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws with regard to our physical sales of energy commodities. In November 2009, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) issued regulations pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, intended to prohibit market manipulation in the petroleum industry. Violators of the regulations face civil penalties of up to $1 million per violation per day. In July 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which incorporated an expansion of the authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to prohibit market manipulation in the markets regulated by the CFTC. This authority, with respect to oil swaps and futures contracts, is similar to the anti-manipulation authority granted to the FTC with respect to oil purchases and sales. In July 2011, the CFTC issued final rules to implement their new anti-manipulation authority. The rules subject violators to a civil penalty of up to the greater of $1.1 million or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation.
  
  Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
  
 Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational safety and health aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection. Numerous governmental entities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions. These laws and regulations may, among other things (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct drilling and other regulated activities; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities; (iii) limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; (iv) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; (v) apply specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and (vi) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations, the occurrence of delays or restrictions in permitting or performance of projects, and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations.

 These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities, or waste handling, storage transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our customers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. Continued compliance with existing requirements is not expected to materially affect us. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance in the future with such existing or any new laws and regulations or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
  
 Additionally, on January 29, 2018, in Martinez v. Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, the Colorado Supreme Court agreed to review a ruling by the Colorado Court of Appeals that held that the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission (“COGCC”) had incorrectly concluded that it lacked statutory authority to undertake a proposed rulemaking “to suspend the issuance of permits that allow hydraulic fracturing until it can be done without adversely impacting human health and safety and without impairing Colorado’s atmospheric resource and climate system, water, soil, wildlife, or other biological resources.” The Colorado Court of Appeals concluded that Colorado’s Oil and Gas Conservation Act mandated that oil and gas development “be regulated subject to the protection of public health, safety, and welfare, including protection of the environment and wildlife resources.” The Colorado Supreme Court said it would consider whether the Colorado Court of Appeals erred in determining that the COGCC misinterpreted the Oil and Gas Conservation Act as “requiring a balance between oil and gas development and public health, safety, and welfare.”
  
 The following is a summary of the more significant existing and proposed environmental and occupational safety and health laws, as amended from time to time, to which our business operations are or may be subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
  
  Hazardous Substances and Wastes
  
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Pursuant to rules issued by the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under RCRA and, instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in December 2016, environmental groups and the EPA entered into a consent decree to address EPA's alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and natural gas wastes, from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. Under this consent decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and natural gas regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Stricter regulation of wastes generated during our operations could result in an increase in our, as well as the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry’s, costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
  
   
22


  
 
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current and former owners and operators of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances.
  
 We currently lease or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration, production and processing for many years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for treatment or disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or petroleum hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake response or corrective measures, which could include removal of previously disposed substances and wastes, cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination, the costs of which could be substantial.
  
  Water Discharges
  
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and hazardous substances, into state waters and waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements imposed under the CWA require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“Corps”) published a final rule to revise the definition of "waters of the United States" (“WOTUS”) for all Clean Water Act programs, but legal challenges to this rule followed and the rule was stayed nationwide by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in October 2015. In response to this decision, the EPA and the Corps resumed nationwide use of the agencies' prior regulations defining the term "waters of the United States." However, in January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the rule revising the WOTUS definition must first be reviewed in the federal district courts, which could result in a withdrawal of the stay by the Sixth Circuit. In addition, the EPA has issued proposals to repeal the rule revising the WOTUS definition and to delay its implementation until 2020 to allow time for the EPA to reconsider the definition of the term "waters of the United States." To the extent this rule or a revised rule expands the scope of the CWA's jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas in connection with any expansion activities. Federal and state regulatory agencies may impose substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations, including spills and other non-authorized discharges. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
  
   
23


  
 
 The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), amends the CWA and sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills. The OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities, and onshore facilities, including exploration and production facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under OPA, responsible parties including owners and operators of onshore facilities may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. The OPA also requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare Facility Response Plans for responding to a worst-case discharge of oil into waters of the United States.
  
  Subsurface Injections
  
 In the course of our operations, we produce water in addition to oil and natural gas. Water that is not recycled may be disposed of in disposal wells, which inject the produced water into non-producing subsurface formations. Underground injection operations are regulated pursuant to the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program established under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and analogous state laws. The UIC program requires permits from the EPA or an analogous state agency for the construction and operation of disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for disposal well operations, and restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be disposed. A change in UIC disposal well regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect our ability to dispose of produced water and ultimately increase the cost of our operations. For example, in response to recent seismic events near belowground disposal wells used for the injection of oil and natural gas-related wastewaters, regulators in some states, including Colorado, have imposed more stringent permitting and operating requirements for produced water disposal wells. In Colorado, permit applications are reviewed specifically to evaluate seismic activity and, as of 2011, the state has required operators to identify potential faults near proposed wells, if earthquakes historically occurred in the area, and to accept maximum injection pressures and volumes based on fracture gradient as conditions to permit approval. Additionally, legal disputes may arise based on allegations that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state or federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation, restriction on the use of injection wells by us or by commercial disposal well vendors whom we may use from time to time to dispose of wastewater, and increased costs of compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating costs, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Air Emissions
  
 The Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, such as, for example, tank batteries and compressor stations, through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance standards. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be charged royalties on natural gas losses or required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues. For example, in October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground-level ozone from 75 parts per billion (“ppb”) for the 8-hour primary and secondary ozone standards to 70 ppb for both standards. On June 6, 2017, the EPA extended the deadline for promulgating initial area designations by one year. Reclassification of areas or imposition of more stringent standards may make it more difficult to construct new or modified sources of air pollution in newly designated non-attainment areas. Also, states are expected to implement more stringent requirements as a result of this new final rule, which could apply to our operations. In addition, during the fall of 2016, the EPA also issued final Control Techniques Guidelines (“CTGs”) for reducing volatile organic compound emissions from existing oil and natural gas equipment and processes in ozone non-attainment areas, including the Denver Metro North Front Range Ozone 8-hour Non-Attainment area. In 2017, as part of the federal CTG process for oil and natural gas, Colorado began a stakeholder and rulemaking effort to compare the CTGs to existing Colorado requirements to ensure they meet applicable federal requirements. This process could result in new or more stringent air quality control requirements applicable to our operations. In another example, in June 2016, the EPA finalized a revised rule regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent permitting requirements. Compliance with these or other air pollution control and permitting requirements have the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development and production, which costs could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

  Regulation of GHG Emissions
  
 In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are already potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that typically will be established by state agencies. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified large, GHG emission sources in the United States, including certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production sources, which include certain of our operations.
  
 Federal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations. In June 2016, the EPA published the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) Subpart OOOOa standards that require certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards will expand previously issued NSPS published by the EPA in 2012 and known as Subpart OOOO, by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices. However, in April 2017, the EPA announced that it would review this methane rule for new, modified and reconstructed sources and initiated reconsideration proceedings to potentially revise or rescind portions of the rule. In June 2017, the EPA also proposed a two-year stay of certain requirements of the methane rule pending the reconsideration proceedings; however, the rule remains in effect in the meantime. Similarly, in November 2016, the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued a final rule to reduce methane emissions by regulating venting, flaring, and leaks from oil and gas operations on federal and American Indian lands. However, in December 2017, BLM finalized a suspension of certain requirements of the rule until 2019. That suspension is now being challenged in court, and substantial uncertainty exists with respect to implementation of the rule.
  
 On the international level, in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that prepared an agreement requiring member countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. This “Paris Agreement” was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016; however, this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, but rather includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. In follow-up to an earlier announcement by President Trump, in August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.
  
 The adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation or regulations that require reporting of GHG or otherwise limit emissions of GHG from our equipment and operations could result in increased costs to reduce emissions of GHG associated with our operations as well as delays or restrictions in our ability to permit GHG emissions from new or modified sources. In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil, natural gas and NGL we produce and lower the value of our reserves, which devaluation could be significant. One or more of these developments could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHG in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations. At this time, we have not developed a comprehensive plan to address the legal, economic, social or physical impacts of climate change on our operations. Finally, notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency, an autonomous intergovernmental organization involved in international energy policy, estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and oil and gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector.

  Hydraulic Fracturing Activities
  
  Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into targeted geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.  Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. Additionally, the EPA published in June 2016 an effluent limitations guideline final rule pursuant to its authority under the SDWA prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants; asserted regulatory authority in 2014 under the SDWA over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities; and issued in 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the BLM published a final rule in March 2015 establishing new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands including well casing and wastewater storage requirements and an obligation for exploration and production operators to disclose what chemicals they are using in fracturing activities. However, following years of litigation, the BLM rescinded the rule in December 2017. Also, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In the event that a new, federal level of legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process is adopted in areas where we operate, we may incur additional costs to comply with such federal requirements that may be significant in nature, and also could become subject to additional permitting requirements and experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities.
  
 At the state level, Colorado, where we conduct operations, is among the states that has adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or well-construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Moreover, states could elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York in 2015. Also, certain interest groups in Colorado opposed to oil and natural gas development generally, and hydraulic fracturing in particular, have from time to time advanced various options for ballot initiatives that, if approved, would allow revisions to the state constitution in a manner that would make such exploration and production activities in the state more difficult in the future. However, during the November 2016 voting process, one proposed amendment placed on the Colorado state ballot making it relatively more difficult to place an initiative on the state ballot was passed by the voters. As a result, there are more stringent procedures now in place for placing an initiative on a state ballot. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions may restrict drilling or the hydraulic fracturing process and cities may adopt local ordinances allowing hydraulic fracturing activities within their jurisdictions but regulating the time, place and manner of those activities. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, including, for example, on federal and American Indian lands, we could incur potentially significant added cost to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
  
   
26


  
 
 In the event that local or state restrictions or prohibitions are adopted in areas where we conduct operations, including the D-J Basin in Colorado, that impose more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas, including, among other things, the development of increased setback distances, we and similarly situated oil and natural exploration and production operators in the state may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and possibly be limited or precluded in the drilling of wells or in the amounts that we and similarly situated operates are ultimately able to produce from our reserves. Any such increased costs, delays, cessations, restrictions or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, including, for example, on federal and American Indian lands, we could incur potentially significant added cost to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
  
 Moreover, because most of our operations are conducted in a particular area, the D-J Basin in Colorado, legal restrictions imposed in that area will have a significantly greater adverse effect than if we had our operations spread out amongst several diverse geographic areas. Consequently, in the event that local or state restrictions or prohibitions are adopted in the D-J Basin in Colorado that impose more stringent limitations on the production and development of oil and natural gas, we may incur significant costs to comply with such requirements or may experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and possibly be limited or precluded in the drilling of wells or in the amounts that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves. Any such increased costs, delays, cessations, restrictions or prohibitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
  
  Activities on Federal Lands
  
 Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on federal lands, including American Indian lands and lands administered by the BLM, are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the BLM, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. While we currently have no exploration, development and production activities on federal lands, our future exploration, development and production activities may include leasing of federal mineral interests, which will require the acquisition of governmental permits or authorizations that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay or limit, or increase the cost of, the development of oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA are also subject to protest, appeal or litigation, any or all of which may delay or halt projects. Moreover, depending on the mitigation strategies recommended in Environmental Assessments or Environmental Impact Statements, we could incur added costs, which may be substantial.
 Endangered Species and Migratory Birds Considerations
  
 The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), and comparable state laws were established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species or that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migrating birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We may conduct operations on oil and natural gas leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species, such as the sage grouse, that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist. Moreover, as a result of one or more agreements entered into by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency is required to make a determination on listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA pursuant to specific timelines. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures, time delays or limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases.
  
   
27


  
 
  OSHA
  
 We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and comparable state statutes and any implementing regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens.
 Related Permits and Authorizations
  
 Many environmental laws require us to obtain permits or other authorizations from state and/or federal agencies before initiating certain drilling, construction, production, operation, or other oil and natural gas activities, and to maintain these permits and compliance with their requirements for on-going operations. These permits are generally subject to protest, appeal, or litigation, which can in certain cases delay or halt projects and cease production or operation of wells, pipelines, and other operations.
  
 We are not able to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See further discussion in “Part I” – “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
  
  Insurance
  
 Our oil and gas properties are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and gas industry, such as accidents, blowouts, explosions, implosions, fires and oil spills. These conditions can cause:

● | damage to or destruction of property, equipment and the environment;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------
● | personal injury or loss of life; and 
● | suspension of operations. 


 
 We maintain insurance coverage that we believe to be customary in the industry against these types of hazards. However, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. In addition, our insurance is subject to coverage limits and some policies exclude coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination. The occurrence of a significant event or adverse claim in excess of the insurance coverage that we maintain or that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
  
  Employees
  
 At December 31, 2017, we employed 6 people and also utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and other services. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
 GLOSSARY OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS TERMS
  
 The following is a description of the meanings of some of the oil and natural gas terms used in this Annual Report.
  
 AFE or Authorization for Expenditures. A document that lays out proposed expenses for a particular project and authorizes an individual or group to spend a certain amount of money for that project.
  
   
28


  
 
 Bbl. One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used in this Annual Report in reference to crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons.
  
 Bcf. An abbreviation for billion cubic feet. Unit used to measure large quantities of gas, approximately equal to 1 trillion Btu.
  
 Boe. Barrels of oil equivalent, determined using the ratio of one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids, to six Mcf of natural gas.
  
 Boepd. Barrels of oil equivalent per day.
  
 Bopd. Barrels of oil per day.
  
 Btu or British thermal unit. The quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
  
 Completion. The operations required to establish production of oil or natural gas from a wellbore, usually involving perforations, stimulation and/or installation of permanent equipment in the well or, in the case of a dry hole, the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency.
  
 Condensate. Liquid hydrocarbons associated with the production of a primarily natural gas reserve.
  
 Conventional resources. Natural gas or oil that is produced by a well drilled into a geologic formation in which the reservoir and fluid characteristics permit the natural gas or oil to readily flow to the wellbore.
  
 Developed acreage. The number of acres that are allocated or assignable to productive wells.
  
 Development well. A well drilled into a proved oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
  
 Estimated ultimate recovery or EUR. Estimated ultimate recovery is the sum of reserves remaining as of a given date and cumulative production as of that date.
  
 Exploratory well. A well drilled to find and produce oil or natural gas reserves not classified as proved, to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or natural gas in another reservoir or to extend a known reservoir.
  
 Farmin or farmout. An agreement under which the owner of a working interest in an oil or natural gas lease assigns the working interest or a portion of the working interest to another party who desires to drill on the leased acreage. Generally, the assignee is required to drill one or more wells in order to earn its interest in the acreage. The assignor usually retains a royalty or reversionary interest in the lease. The interest received by an assignee is a “farmin” while the interest transferred by the assignor is a “farmout.”
  
 FERC. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
  
 Field. An area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition.
  
 Gross acres or gross wells. The total acres or wells in which a working interest is owned.

29


  
 
 Held by production. An oil and natural gas property under lease in which the lease continues to be in force after the primary term of the lease in accordance with its terms as a result of production from the property.
  
 Horizontal drilling or well. A drilling operation in which a portion of the well is drilled horizontally within a productive or potentially productive formation. This operation typically yields a horizontal well that has the ability to produce higher volumes than a vertical well drilled in the same formation. A horizontal well is designed to replace multiple vertical wells, resulting in lower capital expenditures for draining like acreage and limiting surface disruption.
  
 Liquids. Liquids, or natural gas liquids, are marketable liquid products including ethane, propane, butane and pentane resulting from the further processing of liquefiable hydrocarbons separated from raw natural gas by a natural gas processing facility.
  
 LOE or Lease operating expenses. The costs of maintaining and operating property and equipment on a producing oil and gas lease.
  
 MBbl. One thousand barrels of crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons.
  
 MMBbl/d. One thousand barrels of crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons per day.
  
 Mcf. One thousand cubic feet of natural gas.
  
 Mcfgpd. Thousands of cubic feet of natural gas per day.
  
 MMcf. One million cubic feet of natural gas.
  
 MMBtu. One million British thermal units.
  
 Net acres or net wells. The sum of the fractional working interest owned in gross acres or wells.
  
 Net revenue interest. The interest that defines the percentage of revenue that an owner of a well receives from the sale of oil, natural gas and/or natural gas liquids that are produced from the well.
  
 NGL. Natural gas liquids.
  
 NYMEX. New York Mercantile Exchange.
  
 Permeability. A reference to the ability of oil and/or natural gas to flow through a reservoir.
  
 Petrophysical analysis. The interpretation of well log measurements, obtained from a string of electronic tools inserted into the borehole, and from core measurements, in which rock samples are retrieved from the subsurface, then combining these measurements with other relevant geological and geophysical information to describe the reservoir rock properties.
  
 Play. A set of known or postulated oil and/or natural gas accumulations sharing similar geologic, geographic and temporal properties, such as source rock, migration pathways, timing, trapping mechanism and hydrocarbon type.
  
 Possible reserves. Additional reserves that are less certain to be recognized than probable reserves.
  
 Probable reserves. Additional reserves that are less certain to be recognized than proved reserves but which, in sum with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
  
 Producing well, production well or productive well. A well that is found to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities such that proceeds from the sale of the well’s production exceed production-related expenses and taxes.

 Properties. Natural gas and oil wells, production and related equipment and facilities and natural gas, oil or other mineral fee, leasehold and related interests.
  
 Prospect. A specific geographic area which, based on supporting geological, geophysical or other data and also preliminary economic analysis using reasonably anticipated prices and costs, is considered to have potential for the discovery of commercial hydrocarbons.
  
 Proved developed reserves. Proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells and facilities and by existing operating methods.
  
 Proved reserves. Reserves of oil and natural gas that have been proved to a high degree of certainty by analysis of the producing history of a reservoir and/or by volumetric analysis of adequate geological and engineering data.
  
 Proved undeveloped reserves or PUDs. Proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
  
 Repeatability. The potential ability to drill multiple wells within a prospect or trend.
  
 Reservoir. A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil and/or natural gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs.
  
 Royalty interest. An interest in an oil and natural gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to receive a portion of the production from the leased acreage (or of the proceeds of the sale thereof), but generally does not require the owner to pay any portion of the costs of drilling or operating the wells on the leased acreage. Royalties may be either landowner’s royalties, which are reserved by the owner of the leased acreage at the time the lease is granted, or overriding royalties, which are usually reserved by an owner of the leasehold in connection with a transfer to a subsequent owner.
  
 2-D seismic. The method by which a cross-section of the earth’s subsurface is created through the interpretation of reflecting seismic data collected along a single source profile.
  
 3-D seismic. The method by which a three-dimensional image of the earth’s subsurface is created through the interpretation of reflection seismic data collected over a surface grid. 3-D seismic surveys allow for a more detailed understanding of the subsurface than do 2-D seismic surveys and contribute significantly to field appraisal, exploitation and production.
  
 Trend. A region of oil and/or natural gas production, the geographic limits of which have not been fully defined, having geological characteristics that have been ascertained through supporting geological, geophysical or other data to contain the potential for oil and/or natural gas reserves in a particular formation or series of formations.
  
 Unconventional resource play. A set of known or postulated oil and or natural gas resources or reserves warranting further exploration which are extracted from (a) low-permeability sandstone and shale formations and (b) coalbed methane. These plays require the application of advanced technology to extract the oil and natural gas resources.
  
 Undeveloped acreage. Lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Undeveloped acreage is usually considered to be all acreage that is not allocated or assignable to productive wells.

 Unproved and unevaluated properties. Refers to properties where no drilling or other actions have been undertaken that permit such property to be classified as proved.
  
 Vertical well. A hole drilled vertically into the earth from which oil, natural gas or water flows is pumped.
  
 Volumetric reserve analysis. A technique used to estimate the amount of recoverable oil and natural gas. It involves calculating the volume of reservoir rock and adjusting that volume for the rock porosity, hydrocarbon saturation, formation volume factor and recovery factor.
  
 Wellbore. The hole made by a well.
  
 WTI or West Texas Intermediate. A grade of crude oil used as a benchmark in oil pricing. This grade is described as light because of its relatively low density, and sweet because of its low sulfur content.
  
 Working interest. The operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and receive a share of production.
