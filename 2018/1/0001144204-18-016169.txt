Sales Cycle 
 
Our sales cycle is extensive and is often affected by many factors outside of our control including but not limited to client specific proposal and acquisition processes, unique client service requirements, the client’s timetable and urgency, changes in key leadership and/or personnel that slows down the proposal or project, budgetary funding, competitive bidding processes and other policy constraints, as well as additional factors that may lengthen the sales cycle. Many of these variables are outside our control and we attempt to manage the financial impact on us by building a large pipeline with opportunities that have overlapping sales cycles.

Our ability to successfully sell our services depends upon the relationships we build with key decisions makers at prospective customers’ organizations. Selling a solution as a service to a large organization is complicated and often requires an evaluation by different functional groups within the prospective customers organization before a purchase decision is made by the organization. It could take more than 12 months to enter into a contract with a customer from the time we first actively engage a prospective customer and then a full implementation could range from mere weeks to several months depending on the complexity of the customers statement of work and level of engagement by us and the customer to get the deployment completed. Contract closing and implementation timelines vary as a result of these factors, many of which are outside our control.
 
Sales Approaches
 
We utilize one or more of following approaches to identify and close opportunities:
 
Direct Sales Approach. We utilize a direct sales approach globally to identify, sell and close both commercial and government opportunities. We utilize a core sales team consisting of solution experts, sales professionals and other subject matter experts to manage the entire sales process including lead generation, product demonstrations, proposal creation and submission, contract negotiation and closing and final transition of closed deals to the operations team. Sales commissions are paid to our direct sales representative over the life of the initial contract term on a declining or at a fixed rate as a percentage of net collected gross managed service revenues.
Indirect Sales Approach. We utilize an indirect sales approach to reach new target markets by outsourcing our lead generation and certain business development activities through a third party channel partner. Our channel partners understand our product and service offerings and they utilize their sales team to generate leads and connect us with prospective clients using their extensive networks. Channel partners are compensated in the form of a sales commission for deals that are successfully closed. Sales commissions have historically been paid over the life of the initial contract term as a percentage of net collected gross managed service revenues.
Strategic Partnership and Alliance Sales Approach. Strategic partnerships and alliances provide us with additional access to potential clients in larger market opportunities. We may team up with other companies and competitors to bid on a project that includes one or more of our services as part of a larger service solicitation. In these types of arrangements we may operate as either the prime contractor or subcontractor.
Cross Selling and Customer Referrals. We work closely with our customers to align our additional capabilities to meet their requirements. We ask our customers for referrals into their industry network, customer and supplier groups to drive additional sales growth.
 
Our global sales team has a wide variety of skills and expertise to cultivate qualified leads and guide our prospective customers towards finding a solution that meets their organization’s goals and objectives.
 
Marketing and Branding
 
Our marketing strategy is to build our brand and increase market awareness of our solutions in our target markets that will allow us to successfully build strong relationships with key decision markers involved in the sales process on the customer side. Key decisions makers typically consist of information technology executives, finance executives and managers of communications assets and networks.
 
We engage in a wide variety of marketing activities designed to broaden market awareness of our solutions, including internet search engine optimization, e-mail and direct mail campaigns, co-marketing strategies designed to leverage existing strategic relationships, website marketing, topical webcasts, public relations campaigns, speaking engagements and forums and industry analyst visibility initiatives. We participate in and sponsor conferences that cater to our target markets and demonstrate and promote our software and services at trade shows targeted to information technology and finance executives.

We also publish white papers relating to telecom life cycle management and identity management issues and develop customer reference programs, such as customer case studies, in an effort to promote better awareness of industry issues and demonstrate that our solutions can address many of these risks to an organization.
 
Customer Concentrations
 
We derive a significant amount of our revenues from contracts funded by federal government agencies for which we act in capacity as the prime contractor. We believe that contracts with federal government agencies in particular, will be the primary source of our revenues for the foreseeable future although we are working to increase our footprint with commercial clients. Accordingly, negative changes in federal government fiscal or spending policies (including continuing budget resolutions) that impact the budgets of our key government customers, including Department of Homeland Security, will directly affect our financial performance.
 
We expect our federal customers to be motivated to meet their organizational missions for mobile management and security objectives in this challenging environment. We can provide significant savings for our customers and simplify their processes which could impact our billable revenue base and result in lower profit margins if the savings we deliver is not spent by our government customers on other services we provide. We believe we have an attractive set of solutions and our customers have historically spent their savings on other critical services provided by us. We also believe that government spending for cybersecurity services and solutions will increase for the foreseeable future.
 
Our government customer base is located predominantly in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. while our commercial client base is located throughout the continental U.S., Canada, Europe and the Middle East. Historically, we have derived, and may continue to derive in the future, a significant percentage of our total revenues from federal government contracts.
 
Due to the nature of our business and the relative size of certain contracts which are entered into in the ordinary course of business, the loss of any single significant customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In future periods, we will continue to focus on diversifying our revenue by increasing the size and number of customer contracts both in public and private sectors.
 
Government Contracts 
 
We have numerous government contracts and contract vehicles. Contract vehicles include Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (“GWACs”), and Blanket Purchase Agreements (“BPAs”) based upon GSA Schedule 70, and customer specific contracts. We also hold a number of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (“ID/IQ”) contracts, including, but not limited to:

§ | Department of Homeland Security Blanket Purchase Agreement (DHS BPA) for Cellular Wireless Managed Services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Department of Health and Human Services Telecommunications Inventory and Expense Management Solutions contract.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Subsidiaries of WidePoint are approved subcontractors for the following ID/IQ contracts:

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | NASA Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP)
--+------------------------------------------------------


o | Department of Justice Information Technology Support Services (“ITSS”) 3 contract
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have partnerships with Alaska Native Corporations, Native American Companies and other minority owned enterprises that allows us to leverage the U.S. Small Business Administration’s 8(a) programs to vie for work in the public sector. WidePoint will continue to build on our partnerships to out compete our competitors for public sector opportunities.
 
We also have various partnerships with large system integrators that allow us to act as a subcontractor, thereby providing us access to various other contracts and contract vehicles in biometrics and identity management infrastructure support, and Information Technology Support Services.
 
Our contracts with the federal government, and many contracts with other entities, permit the government client to modify, curtail or terminate the contract at any time for the convenience of the government, or for default by the contractor. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we are generally reimbursed for our allowable costs through the date of termination and are paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work actually performed.
 
Product Development and Technology Solution Enhancements
 
We may fund certain product development initiatives to enhance or customize existing client facing platforms and software solutions. These initiatives are aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our software solutions and meet our customer’s changing organizational requirements, as necessary. We determine which enhancements to further develop after assessing the market capabilities sought by potential customers, considering technological advances, feedback on enhancements from our current customer user groups and other factors. Our current development activities are focused on the integration of our heterogeneous services delivery platforms, and improving the security posture and delivery of our information technology services.
 
We utilize a standard architecture to ensure enhancements are subject to appropriate oversight and scrutiny and a consistent and efficient process. Our development team is comprised of professionals with hands-on technical and practical client-side development experience. We believe this allows us to design and deploy enhancements that can resolve real-world problems in a timely manner.
 
We funded and expensed strategic product development initiatives including platform and portal integrations and other product and portal enhancements totaling approximately $219,100 in 2017 and $699,000 in 2016. In 2018, we will continue to work with our strategic partners to continue and focus our product development efforts as well as with client integrations.


Data Centers
 
We host our proprietary solutions and operate all servers, systems and networks at six (6) data centers located in Ireland, Ohio, North Carolina and Virginia, which we may consolidate in the future. Our agreements with our customers contain guarantees regarding specified levels of system availability, and we regularly provide our customers with performance reports against those standards. We utilize monitoring technology that continuously checks the servers and key underlying components at regular intervals for availability and performance, ensuring availability to our customers. Each data center provides security measures, redundant environmental controls, fire suppression systems and redundant electrical generators to meet our service level agreements. To facilitate data loss recovery, we operate a multi-tiered system configuration with load-balanced web server pools, replicated database servers and fault-tolerant storage devices. The architecture is designed to ensure near real-time data recovery in the event of a malfunction of a primary server. Based on customer requirements, we can also provide near real-time asynchronous data replication between operational and disaster recovery backup sites.

Intellectual Property 
 
Our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and other rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. We protect our intellectual property rights in a number of ways including entering into confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, customers, consultants and partners in an attempt to control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary technology and other information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop software or services with the same functionality as our software and services.
 
U.S. patent filings are intended to provide the holder with a right to exclude others from making, using, selling or importing in the United States the inventions covered by the claims of granted patents. Our patents, including our pending patents, if granted, may be contested, circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, the rights that may be granted in those issued and pending patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing those patents. Therefore, the exact benefits of our issued patents and, if issued, our pending patents and the other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty.
 
Market Competition 
 
Target Markets. Our TM2 market is focused on mobile management and security as shown below: 
 

Our target market is highly fragmented and we compete with small and large companies that offer different components of TM2. We believe that we are presently the only provider of all three of these critical services and solutions. We believe that our TM2 solution gives us a strong competitive advantage over our competitors due to our ability to deliver all three on these solutions in an integrated framework, our distinctive technical competencies, governmental certifications and approvals to operate within this space, successful past contract performance with large commercial and government organizations, price and value of services delivered, reputation for quality, and key management personnel with subject matter expertise.

Market Pricing. Pricing offered by competitors in our target markets is often heavily discounted to unprofitable levels thereby creating a commodity pricing environment that affects the perceived value of the solution by our prospective customers. This commodity pricing behavior severely limits profitability for other service providers that provide better solutions, discourages further innovation and harms the customer in the end.  We do not view our services as a commodity and comparability of services against other providers is not practical due to differences in capabilities among competitors. The costs to switch solutions can be high for a prospective customer even if they know their current solution is not working.
 
Pricing for our TM2 solutions will vary depending on our prospective customer’s technology infrastructure, scale of their operations, workflow requirements and many other factors that can affect pricing. All prospective customers tend to initially have price sensitivity and that often changes after we are able to demonstrate that our solutions will save them time and money. We believe our TM2 solution pricing is competitive and reflects the value of the solutions we provide to our customers. Our goal is provide the best solution for our customers that meets their needs. We may not always be the lowest cost provider, and as a result, our ability to win new work and charge a reasonable fee for our services entirely depends on the value perceived by our customers. 
 
Competition. Our TM2 solution crosses into several different market segments and as a result we do not have a competitor that competes in all of the market segments in which we conduct business.  The following table outlines what areas of TM2 our competitors provide:

Competitor | Telecom Life cycle Management | Identity Management | Telecom Bill Presentment and Analytics 
----------------------------------------+--------------------------------+---------------------+----------------------------------------
Tangoe, Inc. | X | | 
Calero Software, LLC | X | | 
Digital Management, LLC | X | | 
Turning Point Global Solutions, LLC | X | | 
Identrust, Inc. | | X | 
Entrust, Inc. | | X | 
Xtec Incorporated | | X | 
Globys, Inc. | | | X 
Amdocs Ltd. | | | X 

 
Our larger competitors often have more size and financial resources than us and they may be able to provide a wider array of technology solutions outside of our core capabilities.  Due to our significant federal government contract concentrations we also experience competition from a variety of both large and small companies, including divisions of large federal government integrators such as Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and other large and mid-sized federal contractors, as well as a limited number of small to mid-sized subject matter expert organizations offering specialized capabilities within the identity management space.
 
If we are unable to keep pace with the intense competition in our marketplace, deliver cost-effective and relevant solutions to our target market, our business, financial condition and results of operations will suffer.

Contracting 
 
We prefer to serve as the prime contractor when we win contract awards; however, we will often enter into strategic teaming agreements with another competitor or a vertical supplier to serve as a subcontractor for a larger market opportunity. Prospective customers in our target market use a wide array of contract vehicles to purchase technology services ranging from individual purchase orders, awards or consolidated service contracts that cover a range of technology services, of which we may or may not be able to provide all of the services to serve as the prime contractor. The same companies that are our competitors will, at times, team with us or subcontract with us in the pursuit of consolidated opportunities from very large Fortune 100 companies.
Seasonality 
 
Our business is not seasonal. However, our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter, due to revenues earned on contracts, the number of billable days in a quarter, the timing of the pass-through of other direct costs, the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter; as well as the schedule of the government agencies for awarding contracts, the term of each contract that we have been awarded and general economic conditions. Because a significant portion of our expenses, such as personnel and facilities costs, are fixed in the short term, successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 247 full-time employees (207 in the U.S. and 40 in Europe). We periodically engage additional consultants and employ temporary employees. Potential employees possessing the unique qualifications required are readily available for both part-time and full-time employment. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated on May 30, 1997, under the laws of the State of Delaware under the name WidePoint Corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 7926 Jones Branch Drive, Suite 520, McLean, Virginia 22102. Our internet address is www.widepoint.com.
