ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company History
 
We were formerly known as Millennium Plastics Corporation and were incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 31, 1999. We abandoned a prior business plan focusing on the development of biodegradable plastic materials. In August 2006, we acquired Midwest Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation pursuant to a reverse merger. After the merger, Midwest Energy became a wholly-owned subsidiary, and as a result of the merger, the former Midwest Energy stockholders controlled approximately 98% of our outstanding shares of common stock. We changed our name to EnerJex Resources, Inc., in connection with the merger, and in November 2007 we changed the name of Midwest Energy (now our wholly-owned subsidiary) to EnerJex Kansas, Inc. (“EnerJex Kansas”). All of our current operations are conducted through EnerJex Kansas, Inc., Black Sable Energy, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Black Sable”) and Black Raven Energy, Inc. a Nevada corporation (“Black Raven”). Our leasehold interests are held in our wholly-owned subsidiaries Black Sable, Working Interest, LLC (“Working Interest”) EnerJex Kansas and Black Raven.
 
Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
 
As discussed under “Item 9B — Other Information” the continued low oil and natural gas prices during 2016 and 2017 have had a significant adverse impact on our business, and, as a result of our financial condition, substantial doubt exists that we will be able to continue as a going concern.
 
On October 19, 2017, EnerJex entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with AgEagle Aerial Systems, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“AgEagle”), which designs, develops, produces, and distributes technologically advanced small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV or drones) that are supplied to the agriculture industry, and AgEagle Merger Sub, Inc., a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into AgEagle, Merger Sub will cease to exist and AgEagle will survive as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). The respective boards of directors of EnerJex and AgEagle have approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
 
At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), the shares of AgEagle capital stock will be automatically converted into the right to receive 85% of the then issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company on a fully-diluted basis. In addition, at the Effective Time all outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of AgEagle common stock will be assumed by the Company and converted into options and warrants to purchase shares of Company common stock. No fractional shares of Company common stock will be issued in the Merger but will be rounded to the nearest whole share. Following the consummation of the Merger, former stockholders of AgEagle with respect to the Merger are expected to own 85% of the Company’s outstanding common stock (inclusive of the AgEagle assumed stock options and warrants), and current common and Series A Preferred stockholders of the Company are expected to own 15% of the Company, excluding shares of common stock that may be issued in connection with the conversion of the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, and not including any additional shares which may be issued in connection with the Company’s closing obligation to provide up to $4 million in new working capital and the elimination of all liabilities currently on the Company’s balance sheet.
 
In connection with the Merger, the Company agreed to file a proxy statement seeking stockholder approval (which proxy was filed as part of the Form S-4 Registration Statement filed by the Company which has become effective to date) to: (a) amend the terms of its Series A Preferred Stock (as discussed below); (b) approve the issuance of the Company’s shares in connection with the Merger to the AgEagle shareholders and new investors, in excess of 19.9% of the Company’s total issued and outstanding shares of common stock; (c) approve the issuance of shares to current Company management and directors in lieu of deferred salary and fees, a majority of which will be held in escrow to secure the Company’s indemnity obligations under the Merger Agreement; and (d) change the name of the Company to “AgEagle Aerial Resources, Inc.” 
 
The Merger Agreement provides that, immediately following the Effective Time, the existing board of directors and officers of the Company will resign and new directors and officers will be appointed by AgEagle.
 
The Company intends to dispose of its principal assets, consisting primarily of its Kansas oil and gas properties, concurrently with the closing of the Merger. In the event the Merger is not consummated, the Company does not have a present intention to dispose of the above described assets.

The completion of the Merger is subject to various customary conditions, including, among other things: (a) the approval of the stockholders of the Company and AgEagle (which Company shareholder approval has been received to date); (b) the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by each of the Company and AgEagle and the compliance by each of the Company and AgEagle with their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement; (c) approval of the stockholders of the Company for the issuance of its common stock and any other securities (x) to the AgEagle stockholders in connection with the Merger and (y) in connection with the financing transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (d) approval for the listing of shares of the Company’s common stock to be issued in the Merger and other related transactions on the NYSE American; and (e) that all of the Company’s assets as disclosed shall have been sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of and the corresponding debt and liabilities shall have been extinguished. The Company’s existing cash resources are insufficient to satisfy all of its outstanding liabilities. Accordingly, in order to satisfy the condition and consummate the Merger, the Company will be required to raise additional funding prior to the closing of the Merger, the failure of which could result in the Company’s failure to consummate the Merger Agreement.
 
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants obligating each of the Company and AgEagle to continue to conduct its respective business in the ordinary course, to provide reasonable access to each other’s information and to use reasonable best efforts to cooperate and coordinate to make any filings or submissions that are required to be made under any applicable laws or requested to be made by any government authority in connection with the Merger. The Merger Agreement also contains a customary “no solicitation” provision pursuant to which, or the completion or termination of the Merger, neither the Company nor AgEagle may solicit or engage in discussions with any third party regarding another acquisition proposal unless, in the Company’s case, it has received an unsolicited, bona fide written proposal that the recipient’s board of directors determines is or would reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal. The Company has paid AgEagle a $50,000 non-refundable fee at the signing of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights in favor of each of the Company and AgEagle.
 
In addition, the Merger Agreement contains provisions for indemnification in the event of any damages suffered by either party as a result of breaches of representations and warranties contained therein. The aggregate maximum indemnification obligation of any indemnifying party for damages with respect to breaches of representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement shall not exceed, in the aggregate, $350,000, other than for fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach. An indemnifying party shall satisfy its indemnification obligations with shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the aggregate amount of losses of the indemnified party, calculated based upon the greater of (i) the value of the Company common stock as of the closing of the Merger; and (ii) the average closing price of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE American for the five trading days immediately prior to the date such a claim is made. The Company has agreed to deposit an aggregate of 1,215,278 shares of common stock to be issued to current officers and directors of the Company in lieu of deferred salary and fees into escrow to secure its indemnification obligations, the issuance of such shares requiring the approval of the Company’s common stockholders.
 
On October 19, 2017, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, a principal stockholder of AgEagle (the “Key AgEagle Stockholder”) entered into a voting agreement in favor of EnerJex (the “EnerJex Voting Agreement”). Pursuant to the EnerJex Voting Agreement, the Key AgEagle Stockholder has agreed, among other things, to vote all shares of capital stock of AgEagle beneficially owned by him in favor of the Merger and the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and any actions required in furtherance thereof. The AgEagle Voting Agreement will terminate upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms; or (ii) the date on which the Merger becomes effective.
 
In connection with, and as a condition to the closing of the Merger, the Company is seeking the consent of the holder of its Series A Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) to amend the terms thereof to: (i) allow the Company to pay all accrued but unpaid dividends up to September 30, 2017 in additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock based on the value of the liquidation preference thereof, (ii) eliminate the right of the Series A Preferred Stock holders to receive any dividends accruing after September 30, 2017, and (iii) convert each share of Series A Preferred Stock into 10 shares of Company common stock. An affirmative vote of 66.7% of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock voting as a class as of the record date of the proxy statement is required to amend the terms of the Certificate of Designation to provide for these changes, as required under the Merger Agreement. As of September 30, 2017, the Series A Preferred Stock had accrued a total of $6,039,972 in accrued but unpaid dividends, which would result in an additional 241,599 shares of Series A Preferred Stock being issued by the Company to satisfy these accrued dividends.
 
The Merger Agreement provides either party the right to terminate the Merger if it has not been consummated by January 31, 2018, provided that if all of the conditions to closing shall have been satisfied or shall be capable of being satisfied at such time, the required closing date may be extended until March 31, 2018. On January 31, 2018, the Company extended the required closing date with AgEagle to March 31, 2018.
 
More information regarding AgEagle, its business operations, financial results and risk factors relating thereto, is described in greater detail in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on October 20, 2017.
 
On November 21, 2017, Alpha Capital Anstalt (“Alpha”) signed a binding commitment letter with the Company to provide prior to or at the closing of the Merger, a minimum of $4 million in new equity capital at a pre-money valuation of between $16 million and $25 million (the “Private Placement”). Per the terms of this commitment letter, in the event any unaffiliated third parties of EnerJex participate in the Private Placement, Alpha’s obligations to fund the Private Placement shall be reduced by such aggregate gross dollar amount funded by such unaffiliated third parties. Alpha has also agreed to convert all notes they hold from the Company into equity at the closing of the Merger. For their funding commitment, Alpha will receive a fee equal to 2.5% of the Company’s outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted basis payable at the closing of the Merger. Alpha’s obligations to fund the Private Placement shall terminate on the earlier to occur of (i) the consummation of the Merger, and (ii) March 31, 2018. The Company further agreed that, at no time from the date hereof until the consummation of the Merger, shall it provide or disclose to Alpha any “material non-public information” regarding itself, without the prior consent of Alpha. The funding of the Private Placement is subject to standard conditions such as accuracy of representations and warranties provided in the Merger Agreement, and other similar conditions.
 
At a special meeting of shareholders held on March 21, 2018, the Company’s shareholders approved (a) the issuance of the Company’s common stock to the shareholders of AgEagle in connection with and pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement in accordance with NYSE American Rules 712 and 713; (b) an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to amend the 10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock to: (i) allow the Company to pay all accrued but unpaid dividends up to September 30, 2017 in additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock based on the value of the liquidation preference thereof, (ii) eliminate the right of the Series A Preferred Stock holders to receive any dividends accruing after September 30, 2017, (iii) convert each share of Series A Preferred Stock into 10 shares of common stock (subject to adjustment for a reverse stock split (discussed below)), and (iv) increase the number of Series A Preferred shares by 241,599 shares; (c) an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to “AgEagle Aerial Systems, Inc.”; (d) the adoption of the EnerJex 2017 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”); (e) the issuance of 2,248,264 shares of common stock to current officers and directors in lieu of deferred salary and fees, a majority of which will be held in escrow to secure the Company’s obligations under the Merger Agreement; (f) the conversion of the Company’s Series C Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of common stock in order to comply with the listing rules of the NYSE American; (g) the conversion of the Company’s 10% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock into shares of common stock in order to comply with the listing rules of the NYSE American; (h) the issuance of shares of the Company’s common stock, conversion of the Company’s Series C Preferred Stock and conversion of $425,000 owed under five promissory notes held by, Alpha Capital Anstalt, of which $200,000 of the notes have previously been converted into Series C Preferred Stock as of the date of this filing, into shares of common stock in order to comply with the listing rules of the NYSE American.

The Plan provides for the grant of up to 2,000,000 shares of common stock (such number based on a post-reverse split amount) as awards which may include incentive stock options (“ISOs”), non-qualified stock options (“NQSOs”), unrestricted shares, restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance stock, performance units, SARs, tandem stock appreciation rights, distribution equivalent rights, or any combination of the foregoing, to key management employees, non-employee directors, and non-employee consultants of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (however, solely Company employees or employees of the Company’s subsidiaries are eligible for incentive stock option awards).
 
Additionally, the Company plans to conduct a 1-for-25 reverse stock split of the Company’s outstanding common stock, which was approved by Company shareholders on April 27, 2017, prior to the closing of the Merger, which the Company anticipates occurring prior to March 31, 2018.
 
In addition, as discussed below under “Significant Developments in 2017” the Company’s lender sold our loan on May 10, 2017.  
 
Significant Developments in 2017 
 
The following briefly describes our most significant corporate developments occurring in 2017:
 
On February 10, 2017, the Company, Texas Capital Bank (“TCB”) and IberiaBank (collectively, “Sellers”), and PWCM Investment Company IC LLC, and certain financial institutions (collectively, “Buyers”) entered into a Loan Sale Agreement (“LSA”), pursuant to which Sellers sold to Buyers, and Buyers purchased from Sellers, all of Sellers’ right, title and interest in, to and under the October 2011 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and related loan documents associated therewith, in exchange for (i) a cash payment of $5,000,000 (the “Cash Purchase Price”), (ii) a Synthetic Equity Interest equal to 10% of the proceeds, after Buyer’s realization of a 150% return on the Cash Purchase Price within five (5) years of the closing date of the sale, with payment being distributed 65.78947368% to TCB and 34.21052632% to IberiaBank, and (iii) at any time prior to February 10, 2022, Buyer may acquire the interest in clause (ii) above. In connection with the LSA, the Company released Sellers and its successors as holders of the rights under the Credit Agreement and Loan Documents, including Buyers, from any and all claims under the Credit Agreement and Loan Documents. 
 
Also on February 10, 2017, the Company and its subsidiaries, and successor lender entered into a binding letter agreement dated February 10, 2017, which was subsequently amended on March 30, 2017 (as amended, the “letter agreement”) pursuant to which:
 

1. | the successor lender agreed to forgive our existing secured loan in the approximate principal amount of $17,295,000, and in exchange entered into a secured promissory note (which we refer to as the “restated secured note”) in the original principal amount of $4,500,000. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | we:
---+----


a. | conveyed our oil and gas properties and associated performance and surety bonds in Colorado, Texas, and Nebraska; 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b. | conveyed all of our shares of Oakridge Energy, Inc. (together, the “conveyed oil and gas assets”); and 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c. | retained our assets in Kansas and continued as a going concern. The Kansas assets currently provide most of our current operating revenue. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The restated secured note:
 

a. | is secured by a first-priority lien in the Company’s oil and gas producing assets situated in the State of Kansas, 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b. | evidences accrued interest on the $4,500,000 principal balance at a rate of 16% per annum, 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c. | bears interest from and after May 1, 2017, at a rate of 16.0% per annum, 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


d. | is pre-payable in full at a discount at any time during the term of the restated secured note upon the Company paying $3,300,000 to successor lender, and 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


e. | matures and is due and payable in full on November 1, 2017 (subject to the extensions described below). 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company has extended the restated secured note to March 23, 2018. We have an option to extend the maturity date of the restated secured note to April 30, 2018, upon payment of an extension fee of $50,000.
 
So long as we repay the $3,300,000 in indebtedness on or prior to the maturity date, as extended, all other amounts payable under the restated secured note are to be forgiven.
 
The closing occurred on May 10, 2017. As part of the closing procedures and net settlement, we issued a promissory note to Pass Creek Resources LLC in the amount of $105,806. The promissory bears interest at 16% per annum and matured on June 9, 2017. The amount due was not paid on June 9, 2017, but the holder has not provided the Company a notice of default.

In connection with the May 10, 2017 closing and in consideration of the satisfaction of $13,425,000 of the amount due under the Credit Agreement, as amended, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries transferred to PCR Holdings LLC, an affiliate of the successor lenders under the Credit Agreement, all of the Company’s oil and gas properties and assets located in Colorado, Texas, and Nebraska, as well as the Company’s shares of Oakridge Energy, Inc.
 
To evidence the Company’s remaining $4,500,000 of indebtedness to PWCM Investment Company IC LLC (“PWCM”), RES Investment Group, LLC (“RES”), Round Rock Development Partners, LP (“Round Rock”), and Cibolo Holdings, LLC (“Cibolo Holdings,” and together with PWCM, RES and Round Rock, “Successor Lenders”), the Company’s subsidiaries (except Kansas Holdings, LLC) entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Cortland Capital Market Services LLC, as Administrative Agent, and the other financial institutions and banks parties thereto (the “New Credit Agreement”), and a related Amended and Restated Note (the “New Note”), in the amount of $3.3 million as described above. 
 
Our subsidiaries’ obligations under the credit agreement and note are non-recourse and are secured by a first-priority lien in the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ oil properties and assets located in Kansas. The Company was removed as a borrower under the Credit Agreement, but entered into a Guaranty of Recourse Carveouts, pursuant to which the Company guarantees its subsidiaries’ payment of certain fees and expenses due under the Credit Agreement, and may be liable for certain conduct, such as fraud, bad faith, gross negligence, and waste of the Kansas oil properties or assets.
 
On April 27, 2017, the Company entered into a Services Agreement (“Service Agreement”) with Camber Energy, Inc., to perform certain outsourced interim services for $150,000 per month. Effective December 4, 2017, the Company and Camber Energy, Inc. (“Camber”), mutually agreed to terminate the agreement between the parties effective November 30, 2017.
 
On December 20, 2017, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement for the sale of 1,061,750 shares of its Series A 10% Preferred Stock (“Preferred Stock”). The Preferred Stock was sold to one investor at $0.612 per share or the aggregate of $649,791. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the sale of the Preferred Stock to satisfy certain closing conditions of the Merger.
 
On December 22, 2017, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amendment) with Pass Creek Resources, LLC (“Pass Creek”) and Cortland Capital Market Services, LLC (“Administration Agent”). The Company, Pass Creek, and Administrative Agent are parties to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated May 10, 2017. The Maturity Date of the Loan has been extended to the earlier of (i) February 15, 2018 or April 30, 2018, if (a) the Company provides notice to the Administrative Agent of their intent to extend the maturity date and (b) no later than the first Business Day following delivery of such notice pay a $100,000 extension fee, or (ii) the merger of AgEagle Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and AgEagle Aerial Systems, Inc. pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October 19, 2017. At the closing of the First Amendment, the Company paid Pass Creek a $65,000 extension fee and $7,500 to the Administrative Agent for additional fees. The Company also paid the Administrative Agent an additional $45,000 upon the filing of a definitive proxy statement by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company also agreed to borrow Improvement Advances in an amount not to exceed $300,000. The Company has extended the restated secured note to March 23, 2018. We have the option to extend the maturity date of the restated secured note to April 30, 2018, upon payment of an extension fee of $50,000.
 
Our Business
 
Our principal strategy, other than completing the Merger as described above, is to acquire, develop, explore and produce domestic onshore oil and natural gas properties. Our business activities are currently focused in Kansas.
 
Our total net proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2017 were 0.5 million barrels of oil equivalents (BOE), of which 100% was oil. Of the 0.5 million BOE of total proved reserves, approximately 14.7% are classified as proved developed producing and approximately 85.3% are classified as proved undeveloped.
 
The total PV10 (present value) of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $1.5 million. “PV10” means the estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated production and future development and abandonment costs after giving consideration of salvage value there were no material abandonment costs included in future development costs, using prices and costs in effect at the determination date, before income taxes, and without giving effect to non-property related expenses, discounted to a present value using an annual discount rate of 10% in accordance with the guidelines of the SEC. PV10 is a non-GAAP financial measure and generally differs from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Reserves” page 36, for a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure.
 
Except where noted, the discussion regarding our business in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is as of December 31, 2017.

----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Net acreage is based on our net working interest as of December 31, 2017. 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mississippian Project
 
Our Mississippian Project is located in Woodson and Greenwood Counties in Southeast Kansas, where we own a 90% working interest in 4,949 gross acres. Approximately 73.5% of the gross leased acres in this project are currently held-by-production.
 
As of December 31, 2017, our Mississippian Project was producing approximately 100 gross barrels of oil per day from the Mississippian formation at a depth of approximately 1,700 feet. 
 
Our Business Strategy
 
Since the execution of the merger agreement on October 19, 2017, our primary business strategy has focused on achieving the requirements necessary to consummate the merger. We continue to move forward with this strategy with an anticipated closing prior to March 31, 2018. Prior to our pending merger, our principal strategy focused on the development of oil and gas properties that have low production decline rates and offer drilling opportunities with low risk profiles. Our oil and gas operations are in Kansas. The principal elements of our business strategy were:

● | Develop Our Existing Properties. Creating production, cash flow, and reserve growth by developing our inventory of hundreds of drilling locations that we have identified on our existing properties. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maximize Operational Control. We seek to operate and maintain a substantial working interest in the majority of our properties. We believe the ability to control our drilling inventory will provide us with the opportunity to more efficiently allocate capital, manage resources, control operating and development costs, and utilize our experience and knowledge of oil and gas field technologies. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduce Unit Costs Through Economies of Scale and Efficient Operations. As we increase our oil and gas production and develop our existing properties, we expect that our unit cost structure will benefit from economies of scale. In particular, we anticipate reducing unit costs by greater utilization of our existing infrastructure over a larger number of wells. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our future financial results will continue to depend on:
 

● | the market price for oil, gas and natural gas liquids; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our ability to preserve sufficient working capital and maintain access to capital resources; 


● | our ability to cost effectively manage our operations; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to source and evaluate potential projects; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to discover and exploit commercial quantities of oil and gas; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to implement development program. 
--+--------------------------------------------------

We cannot guarantee that we will succeed in any of these respects. Further, we cannot know if the price of crude oil and natural gas prevailing at the time of production will be at a level allowing for profitable production, or that we will be able to obtain additional funding at terms favorable to us to increase our capital resources. A detailed description of these and other risks that could materially impact our actual results is in “Risk Factors” under ITEM 1A.
 
In the event the merger is not consummated, our intent is to refocus on the development of oil and gas properties as set forth above. 
 
Drilling Activity
 
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no drilling activity.

Proved Reserves
 
The estimated total PV10 (present value) of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 was $1.5 million, compared to $3.4 million as of December 31, 2016. Our total net proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2017 were 0.5 million BOE (100% oil), compared to 1.6 million BOE (64.1% natural gas) as of December 31, 2016. Of the 0.5 million net BOE of total proved reserves at December 31, 2017, approximately 14.7% are classified as proved developed producing and approximately 85.3% are classified as proved undeveloped. See “Glossary” on page 14 for our definition of PV10.
 
The estimated PV10 of the 0.5 million BOE is set forth in the following table. The PV10 is calculated using an average net oil price of $45.45 per barrel and by applying an annual discount rate of 10% to the forecasted future net cash flow.

Oil and Gas Reserves Reported to Other Agencies
 
We did not file any estimates of total proved net oil and gas reserves with, or include such information in reports to any federal authority or agency, other than the SEC, during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Title to Properties
 
We believe that we have satisfactory title to or rights in all of our producing properties. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, minimal investigation of title is made at the time of acquisition of undeveloped properties. In most cases, we investigate title and obtain title opinions from counsel or have title reviewed by professional landmen only when we acquire producing properties or before we begin drilling operations. However, any acquisition of producing properties without obtaining title opinions is subject to a greater risk of title defects.
 
Our properties are subject to customary royalty interests, liens under indebtedness, liens incident to operating agreements and liens for current taxes and other burdens, including mineral encumbrances and restrictions. Further, our debt is secured by liens substantially on all of our assets. These burdens have not materially interfered with the use of our properties in the operation of our business to date, though there can be no assurance that such burdens will not materially impact our operations in the future.
 
Sale of Oil and Gas
 
We do not intend to refine our oil production. We expect to sell all or most of our production to a small number of purchasers in a manner consistent with industry practices at prevailing rates by means of long-term and short-term sales contracts, some of which may have fixed price components. In 2017, we sold oil to ARM Energy Management LLC, Coffeyville Resources, Inc., and Sunoco Logistics, Inc. on a month-to-month basis (i.e., without a long-term contract). We sold our natural gas to United Energy Trading on a month-to-month basis and Western Operating Company under a long-term contract. Under current conditions, we should be able to find other purchasers, if needed. All of our produced oil is held in tank batteries. Each respective purchaser picks up the oil from our tank batteries and transports it by truck to refineries.

Secondary Recovery and Other Production Enhancement Strategies
 
When an oil field is first produced, the oil typically is recovered as a result of natural pressure within the producing formation, often assisted by pumps of various types. The only natural force present to move the crude oil to the wellbore is the pressure differential between the higher pressure in the formation and the lower pressure in the wellbore. At the same time, there are many factors that act to impede the flow of crude oil, depending on the nature of the formation and fluid properties, such as pressure, permeability, viscosity and water saturation. This stage of production is referred to as “primary production”, which typically only recovers 5% to 15% of the crude oil originally in place in a producing formation.
 
Production from oil fields can often be enhanced through the implementation of “secondary recovery”, also known as water flooding, which is a method in which water is injected into the reservoir through injector wells in order to maintain or increase reservoir pressure and push oil to the adjacent producing wellbores. We utilize water flooding as a secondary recovery technique for the majority of our oil properties in Kansas.
 
As a water flood matures over time, the fluid produced contains increasing amounts of water and decreasing amounts of oil. Surface equipment is used to separate the produced oil from water, with the oil going to holding tanks for sale and the water being re-injected into the oil reservoir.
 
In addition, we may utilize 3D seismic analysis, horizontal drilling, and other technologies and production techniques to improve drilling results and oil recovery, and to ultimately enhance our production and returns. We also believe use of such technologies and production techniques in exploring for, developing, and exploiting oil properties will help us reduce drilling risks, lower finding costs and provide for more efficient production of oil from our properties.
 
Markets and Marketing
 
The oil and gas industry has experienced dramatic price volatility in recent years. As a commodity, global oil prices respond to macro-economic factors affecting supply and demand. In particular, world oil prices have risen and fallen in response to political unrest and supply uncertainty in the Middle East, and changing demand for energy in rapidly emerging market economies, notably India and China. North American prospects became more attractive as oil prices rose worldwide. Escalating conflicts in the Middle East and the ability of OPEC to control supply and pricing are some of the factors impacting the availability of global supply. As a commodity, natural gas prices respond mainly to regional supply and demand imbalances. Factors that affect the supply side include production of natural gas, levels of natural gas imports and fluctuations in underground storage. Factors that affect the demand side include peak demand brought on by winter heating and summer cooling requirements and increasing demand from the petrochemical industry for their produced products such as plastics, fertilizers, paints, soaps etc. The costs of steel and other products used to construct drilling rigs and pipeline infrastructure, as well as, drilling and well-servicing rig rates, are impacted by the commodity price volatility.
 
Our market is affected by many factors beyond our control, such as the availability of other domestic production, commodity prices, the proximity and capacity of oil and gas pipelines, and general fluctuations of global and domestic supply and demand. In 2017 we had month-to-month sales contracts with ARM Energy Management LLC, Coffeyville Resources, Inc., Sunoco Logistics, Inc., United Energy Trading and Western Operating Company and we do not anticipate difficulty in finding additional sales opportunities, as and when needed.
 
Oil and gas sales prices are negotiated based on factors such as the spot price or posted price for oil and gas, price regulations, regional price variations, hydrocarbon quality, distances from wells to pipelines, well pressure, and estimated reserves. Many of these factors are outside our control. Oil and gas prices have historically experienced high volatility, related in part to ever-changing perceptions within the industry of future supply and demand.
 
 Competition
 
The oil and gas industry is intensely competitive and we must compete against larger companies that may have greater financial and technical resources than we do and substantially more experience in our industry. These competitive advantages may better enable our competitors to sustain the impact of higher exploration and production costs, oil and gas price volatility, productivity variances between properties, overall industry cycles and other factors related to our industry. Their advantage may also negatively impact our ability to acquire prospective properties, develop reserves, attract and retain quality personnel and raise capital.
Research and Development Activities
 
We have not spent a material amount of time or money on research and development activities in the last two years.
 
12


Governmental Regulations
 
Our oil and gas exploration, production and related operations, when developed, are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state, tribal and local authorities and agencies that impose requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. For example, laws and regulations often address conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the spacing, plugging and abandonment of wells, rates of production, water discharge, prevention of waste, and other matters. Prior to drilling, we are often required to obtain permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and file reports concerning operations. Failure to comply with any such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Moreover, laws and regulations may place burdens from previous operations on current lease owners that can be significant.
 
The public attention on the production of oil and gas will most likely increase the regulatory burden on our industry and increase the cost of doing business, which may affect our profitability. Although we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. Significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
The price we may receive from the sale of oil and gas will be affected by the cost of transporting products to markets. Effective January 1, 1995, FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system for transportation rates for oil and gas pipelines, which, generally, would index such rates to inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. We are not able to predict with certainty the effect, if any, of these regulations on our intended operations. However, the regulations may increase transportation costs or reduce well head prices for oil and natural gas.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations and properties are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment, and relating to safety and health. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation generally is toward stricter standards, and this trend will likely continue.
 
These laws and regulations may:
 

● | require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from its operations, or due to previous operations conducted on any leased lands. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The permits required for our operations may be subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce their regulations, and violations are subject to fines or injunctions, or both. In the opinion of management, we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations, and have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in interpretations thereof could have a significant impact on us, as well as the oil and gas industry in general.
 
The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”), and comparable state statutes impose strict, joint and several liability on owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of “hazardous substances” found at such sites. It is not uncommon for the neighboring land owners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of “solid waste” and “hazardous waste” and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from its definition of “hazardous substance,” state laws affecting our operations may impose clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum related products. In addition, although RCRA classifies certain oil and gas field wastes as “non-hazardous”, such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes thereby making such wastes subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements.
 
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended (“Clean Water Act”), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into federal and state waters. These laws also regulate the discharge of storm water in process areas. Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we are required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater and storm water and develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans”, in connection with on-site storage of greater than threshold quantities of oil and gas. The EPA issued revised SPCC rules in July 2002 whereby SPCC plans are subject to more rigorous review and certification procedures. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable Clean Water Act and analogous state requirements, including those relating to wastewater and storm water discharges and SPCC plans.
 
13


The Endangered Species Act, as amended (“ESA”), seeks to ensure that activities do not jeopardize endangered or threatened animal, fish and plant species, nor destroy or modify the critical habitat of such species. Under ESA, exploration and production operations, as well as actions by federal agencies, may not significantly impair or jeopardize the species or its habitat. ESA provides for criminal penalties for willful violations of the Act. Other statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and that may apply to our operations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. Although we believe that our operations will be in substantial compliance with such statutes, any change in these statutes or any reclassification of a species as endangered could subject us to significant expenses to modify our operations or could force us to discontinue certain operations altogether.
 
Personnel
 
We currently have one full-time employee. We are using and will continue to use independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services, particularly in the area of land services, reservoir engineering, and general and administrative functions. We believe that this use of third-party service providers may enhance our ability to contain operating and general expenses, and capital costs.

Probable Reserves | Probable reserves are additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with Proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. 

 
15



Proved Developed Reserves | Proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered from existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. This definition of proved developed reserves has been abbreviated from the applicable definitions contained in Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X.

Recompletion | Completion of an existing well for production from one formation or reservoir to another formation or reservoir that exists behind casing of the same well. 
Reservoir | The underground rock formation where oil and gas has accumulated. It consists of a porous rock to hold the oil and gas, and a cap rock that prevents its escape. 


Secondary Recovery | The stage of hydrocarbon production during which an external fluid such as water or natural gas is injected into the reservoir through injection wells located in rock that has fluid communication with production wells. The purpose of secondary recovery is to maintain reservoir pressure and to displace hydrocarbons toward the wellbore. The most common secondary recovery techniques are natural gas injection and water flooding. Normally, natural gas is injected into the natural gas cap and water is injected into the production zone to sweep oil and gas from the reservoir. A pressure-maintenance program can begin during the primary recovery stage, but it is a form of enhanced recovery.
